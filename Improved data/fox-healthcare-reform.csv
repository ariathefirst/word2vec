                Massachusetts, the bluest of states in our union, stunned the nation on Tuesday when it voted to end Washington’s unbridled spending and plan for government-run health care. Seventy-eight percent of Republican Scott Brown’s voters strongly oppose the current health care legislation. Sixty-one percent of Brown’s voters said deficit reduction was more important to them than health care.

Americans still want health care reform, but they are looking for clear, patient-centered, fiscally responsible solutions. Physicians for Reform offers such a plan. Here are five reforms we propose.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                REFORM #1: Sell Insurance Across State Lines

FACT: State mandates drive up costs

• Health insurance for a 25-year-old male in New Jersey costs nearly six times what it does in Kentucky, largely because of state mandates.

• Introducing choice and competition reduces business overhead. Businesses could use these savings to raise wages or hire workers. This stimulates the economy without spending a dime of federal money.

FACT: Interstate competition optimizes legislative oversight

• Competing incentives push states toward quality and efficiency. Increased regulation protects patients. Decreased regulation attracts business. If fifty state legislatures compete to balance patient protection against affordability, effective and efficient oversight will emerge.

• The alternative is to have federal mandates—giving Americans no choice and leaving the political class with no competition.

We the People provide oversight

• Independent watchdog groups could rate states and insurance companies on cost and patient satisfaction. This sifts the good from the bad.

• Armed with knowledge and incentive, Americans would push insurers to offer better, cheaper products tailored to their specific needs.

CONCLUSION: Allowing businesses to purchase insurance across state lines empowers We the People, not Washington, and does not cost a dime. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer repeatedly questioned President Obama’s senior adviser David Axelrod about this reform. Axelrod offered no reason why it would not work. This measure should enjoy bipartisan support.

REFORM #2: Let individuals purchase health insurance with pre-tax dollars

FACT: Insurance companies serve businesses, not patients

• Businesses purchase employee health insurance with pre-tax dollars. Individuals purchase insurance with post-tax dollars making their insurance far more expensive.

• This reform lets patients buy products that meet their needs and makes insurers more accountable to patients.

CONCLUSION: This reform empowers We the People and requires no federal spending.

REFORM #3: Encourage Health Care Savings Accounts (HSAs)

FACT: HSAs reduce health care costs without rationing (cutting Medicare)

• No one spends someone else’s money as wisely as they spend their own. This is the fundamental problem of any third-party-payer system (whether insurance companies or government).

• When a third party pays, nobody cares about cost. HSAs encourage patients to ask:                 
                

            
                1) How much does this cost?                 
                

            
                2) Do I need this test or medication?

• HSAs let patients control their own money, decreasing health care spending by 13%.

• This “bends the curve” without rationing care. During 2005 and 2006, traditional insurance rose 7.3% annually. Lower cost / higher deductable plans combined with HSAs rose only 2.7% annually.

FACT: HSAs encourage “young invincibles” to buy insurance

• Allowing patients to transfer unused, pre-tax HSA dollars to retirement accounts gives “young invincibles” a reason to purchase health insurance.

• Washington’s “reform” forces younger / healthier Americans to buy insurance under threat of fines or prison.

CONCLUSION: By addressing a fundamental problem of today’s health care system, this reform “bends the curve” without rationing care. Again, it empowers We the People without plunging America further into debt.

REFORM #4: End abusive medical litigation

FACT: Frivolous litigation drives physicians out of medicine

• Tremendous upheaval occurs when physicians are accused of malpractice—even when acquitted. Bringing tens of millions of new patients into the system requires more physicians, not fewer.

FACT: Frivolous litigation reform lowers cost and improves access to care

• Americans spend approximately $124 billion every year because physicians practice defensive medicine. Frivolous lawsuit reform could reduce healthcare spending by approximately $70 billion annually.

• In 2002, 62% of counties in Texas did not have an obstetrician. After passing frivolous medical litigation reform in 2003, nearly 600 obstetricians returned to practice medicine in the Lone Star State by 2007.                
                

            
                CONCLUSION: Ending abusive litigation “bends the curve” without rationing care. Physicians for Reform outlines medical litigation reform that reduces frivolous suits, expedites legitimate suits, and holds negligent physicians accountable. (www.PhysiciansForReform.org)

REFORM #5: Covering the uninsured

FACT: We can insure the uninsured without expanding American debt

• Approximately 25% of patients who visit the emergency room where I work do not have health care coverage. Clearly something must be done.

• A system of tax credits can help the uninsured purchase coverage. This would cost approximately $80 billion annually. Reforms #1 through #4 will save approximately $120 billion annually, covering the uninsured. Healthcare reform must be viewed in terms of American debt, not federal deficit.

Getting Health Care Reform Right

Scott Brown's election to the Senate gives the nation a chance to slow down and rethink health care reform. It gives our lawmakers an opportunity to keep the patient at the center of American health care. And to do this we must:

- Scrap the current legislation.
- Enact the five reforms listed above.
- Pass each reform separately, one bill every four months.
- Limit each bill to 50 pages.
- Let each bill pass or fail on its own merits—no pork, no pay-offs.
- Make final language available to the public for at least 7 days prior to voting.

We the People want patient-centered, fiscally responsible reform. Change for the sake of change is not enough. Massachusetts voters made this clear. Washington, listen and give Americans real solutions. Only then will we support you at the ballot box.

Obama's 5 Health Care Myths,"If you're trying to follow the health care debate, you know there are some ""truths"" which have been repeated so frequently, and with such vehemence, that they have become gospel. How often have you heard ""the costs are skyrocketing"" or ""our system is broken"" or ""Americans overwhelmingly support reform""? Here's a heads-up: Some of these are simply baloney.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                For instance, those pushing reform have described our healthcare system as ""broken,"" thus in desperate need of overhaul. The primary evidence for this claim is a report issued by the World Health Organization in 2000 which ranked the U.S. 37th in overall ""health performance"" despite being number one in spending. (It is noteworthy that the WHO no longer publishes such a ranking -- deeming the process ""too difficult."") Betsy McCaughey, in a recent talk before the Manhattan Institute, noted that the rankings were heavily weighted towards social goals, and less towards the effectiveness of medical care. In other words, the WHO studied the distribution of medical attention, and the fairness in financial contribution, placing as much weight on such issues as on actual performance.                
                

            
                Further, according to Princeton professors Uwe Reinhardt and Tsung-mei Chung, the rankings ""are not based on the actual values achieved by the nation, but on the ratio of the achieved values to the values that ought to have been achieved, given the country's educational attainment and spending."" They point out that the rankings, in effect, were determined by the opinions of those surveyed. In short, this is hardly a scientific assessment.                
                

            
                Even against this bias, the U.S. ranked number one in ""responsiveness"" -- that is in actually delivering care, but got hammered on ""fairness of financial contribution."" The country that scored highest on that metric -- Colombia -- ranked 82nd on responsiveness. Would you rather be treated in Colombia or in the U.S.?                
                

            
                The WHO publishes reams of data that may more accurately describe the medical care a country receives. For instance, life expectancy is a decent proxy for the overall level of health and healthcare in a country. The life expectancy of those born in the U.S. was 78 years in 2007, up from 77 in 2000 and 75 in 1990. This figure is not at the top of the heap -- Japan's sushi-eaters can hope to live to 83, for instance, while a number of Western countries (Iceland, Italy and Australia among others) are at 82, but it is certainly respectable and better than most. The Russian Federation, for instance, has a life expectancy of only 66 years. Another gauge of a country's medical support is infant mortality. In the U.S., the WHO says, 4 out of every 1,000 births ends in death; only a handful of countries report a lower figure. Statistics show that 99% of births in the US are attended by ""skilled health personnel"" -- a figure only surpassed by Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tuvalu, among others. (Do we detect the challenges confronted by the WHO's data collectors?)                
                

            
                Myth number two about our healthcare system is that the growth in spending on healthcare has accelerated in recent years. In fact, in 2007 -- the most recent year for which we have data -- health care spending decelerated, to 6.1% from 6.7% in 2006. More interesting is that the rate of growth has dropped every year since 2002, and that the average increase so far this decade -- 7.4%, though modestly ahead of the growth rate in the 1990s, trails far behind the 11.3% increase rate of the 1980s and 12.7% of the 1970s. Health care spending may be growing too rapidly, but it is not accelerating.                
                

            
                Myth number three about health care spending is that the increases in outlays portray a system ""out of control"" and bloated by greed and inefficiency. In fact, some argue that the growth in the sector stems directly from the aging of the population and advances in medical technologies. Knee replacements are expensive, but they are also now commonplace. Lipitor and other statin drugs cost a great deal, but they also prolong life and can eliminate heart disease. (The unfortunate reality is that prolonging life costs money, too.)                
                

            
                According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, from 1997 to 2007 the number of prescriptions purchased in the US rose 72%, while the population grew just 11%. Over half of Americans take one prescription drug on a regular basis; one in five takes four or more. Overall, prescription drugs account for only 10% of the healthcare dollar, but this category has grown faster than overall spending. The reality is that Americans choose to spend money on the best treatments available.                
                

            
                Our fourth healthcare myth is that Americans overwhelmingly want to see the system changed. It just ain't so. A Gallup poll conducted late last year showed that 49% of respondents wanted to maintain the current system, while 41% wanted it to change. In a more recent Rasmussen poll, only 50% of all voters are in favor of the president's reform plan. A mere 12% of respondents think their healthcare coverage will improve under the proposed overhaul, while 37% expect their coverage to be worse. The remaining 37% do not expect to see any change. In other words, 74% of Americans do not see healthcare reform improving their own situation.                
                

            
                The fifth myth is that Americans are deeply concerned about extending health insurance to those not covered. In fact, a recent Kaiser Foundation poll found that 54% of Americans are not willing to pay more -- either in higher health insurance premiums or higher taxes -- to increase the number of Americans that have coverage. As a country, we are concerned about the rise in healthcare expenditures, and are heartbroken when we hear of people who have been denied medical treatment, but we do not want to pick up the tab for them.                
                

            
                The United States does have to confront the reality that some people in this country are crushed by medical costs, and some receive inadequate treatment. But the debate over how to remedy these problems should be framed by facts, not myths.

What Women  Want In a Supreme Court Nominee,"In the Mel Gibson-Helen Hunt movie, ""What Women Want,"" Gibson’s character is struck by lightning and can suddenly read women’s minds, a gift that he comes to enjoy and uses to learn what women want and provide it for them. Of course, he uses the power to his advantage as well but manages to do some good in the meantime.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The elusive desires of women are becoming clearer as we learn that the majority of Tea Partiers are actually women. And what do they want? A sound economic policy for our country, less government intrusion in our everyday lives, and a society that values life in all stages.                
                

            
                Women have made it easy for the Obama administration to read their minds, yet the policies put forth, or rather rammed through Congress, are anything but what women, and the majority of Americans for that matter, want.                
                

            
                Coming off of a year-long health care battle, President Obama now faces the extraordinary task of nominating a lifelong Supreme Court justice, one that will most likely have a final say on whether or not Obama’s unpopular healthcare reform legislation is constitutional.                
                

            
                President Obama’s actions thus far have pointed to a complete disregard for the Constitution. He has instituted government programs that will micromanage every aspect of our lives. Women make the majority of health care decisions in the family and don’t want the government intruding on that right.                
                

            
                I fear that the president will nominate someone who follows his own ideology and will ignore the Constitution in order to rubber-stamp their liberal political agenda. And that is a scary thought. The health care bill will look like a walk in the park compared to a court stacked with Obama appointees.                
                

            
                During his campaign, Obama said that a judge’s personal feelings can trump the fair application of the law. A recent Rasmussen poll asked whether or not a Supreme Court judge should make decisions according to what’s written in the Constitution or rather guided by a sense of fairness. A full 60% favored laws according to the precedents set in the Constitution.                
                

            
                And contrary to the leanings of supposed women’s rights groups like Planned Parenthood and the National Organization of Women, the majority of American women are pro-life, which corresponds to the founding principles of our great country.                
                

            
                Just because Justice Stevens was a liberal on the Court, it does not mean that President Obama must nominate another liberal to replace him. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards is already salivating at the possibility of a justice who will “stand equally strong for” abortion on demand.                
                

            
                Obama sailed into office as a man expected to heal the nation, unite the political parties, and bring warm fuzzies to a country divided. On the contrary, since entering the White House our president and his policies have driven the country into an unfathomable divide, even lending to the uprising of the Tea Party movement, which brought out everyone from retirees to soccer moms -- and professionals who never cared about politics -- because Obama introduced policies that would destroy the lives they had built.                
                

            
                Women want a Justice who will uphold the Constitution, the right to life, and will preserve the family as a foundational cornerstone of our society. They don’t want someone who will legislate from the bench and uphold abhorrent legislation like the health care bill.                
                

            
                You don’t need to be struck by lightning to figure this out.

Why some Democrats are turning on Obama,"Last week the three most powerful Democrats in the state of West Virginia — Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, Senator Joe Manchin and Rep. Nick Rahall – made a public display of turning their backs on President Obama by announcing plans to skip the Democratic National Convention.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The president lost West Virginia in 2008 and his polling there remains weak. So local Democrats have decided they have no problem embarrassing the man whose name will be on the top of their ticket in November.                
                

            
                The same political distancing act is on display in Pennsylvania’s 12th congressional district. Conservative Democrat Mark Critz also says he has better things to do than go to the convention. Rep. Critz said he will be working in his district instead of  “focusing on the agendas of the political parties.”                
                

            
                In the harsh, polarized world of Washington politics, Republicans take delight in opposing every legislative proposal from President Obama.                
                

            
                But when the history of Obama’s first term is written, conservative Democrats will also be remembered for regularly throwing wrenches into any plans coming from this president.                
                

            
                The conservative Democrats — mostly elected from swing states in the anti-President George W. Bush wave elections of 2006 and 2008 — gave the president headaches even when Democrats controlled the House and Senate.                
                

            
                The best example was the fight over health care reform.                
                

            
                Republicans did not give the president a single vote despite a plan that followed previous GOP proposals — most notably Mitt Romney’s Massachusetts law — and excludes a public option for insurance. That left the president in need of every Democrat’s vote. Note that liberal Democrats who wanted a public option did not abandon the president.                
                

            
                But those conservative Democrats squeezed the Obama Team for concessions and amendments that allowed Republican critics to disparage the negotiations as “Chicago-style” bribery used to win support for a bad proposal.                
                

            
                Words and phrases such as  “kickbacks” and “sausage making” became associated with healthcare reform. And they became Republican talking points that drove down public support for the healthcare deal even as most Americans praised the individual changes the bill achieved.                
                

            
                The president again had trouble with conservative Democrats in April when he said he would veto any transportation bill that included the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. Conservative Democrats walked out on the president when 69 of them joined the GOP to vote legislation that included the oil sands pipeline.                
                

            
                And in the last week, seven conservative Senate Democrats undercut the president’s negotiations with Republicans over a budget deal. They have declined to adopt the president’s negotiating position against another extension of the Bush-era income tax rates.                
                

            
                The move weakens Obama in negotiations with the GOP.                
                

            
                A weak presidential candidate at the top of the ticket does not usually help anyone on the ticket. But in this election cycle conservative Democrats obviously see their political fortunes as separate from Obama’s.                
                

            
                One of those conservative Democrats, Sen. Claire McCaskill, is locked in a tough reelection fight in Missouri, a state Obama lost in 2008. In addition to backing away from the president on the budget deal, she is also backing away on immigration policy changes allowing young illegal immigrants in high school or the military to avoid deportation.                
                

            
                “My preference would be for Congress to resolve this issue …,” McCaskill said. “I’ll be looking at the details of this announcement closely to ensure it isn’t a magnet for illegal immigration.”                
                

            
                McCaskill is distancing herself from the president in the hope of persuading swing voters that she is more of an independent than a Democrat.                
                

            
                A Rasmussen poll taken earlier this month found McCaskill losing to her likely GOP opponent by 12 points. McCaskill needs independent voters and she does not see the Obama brand helping her cause.                
                

            
                From the Obama campaign’s perspective, the conservative Democrats’ strategy is damaging.                
                

            
                Obama also wants to win over independents. He could use conservative Democrats as allies.                
                

            
                The result is the White House never punishes the turncoats.                
                

            
                The Obama campaign is too busy energizing its liberal base right now with support for gay marriage, the new immigration policy and preventing student loans from skyrocketing. Those policies may be enough punishment for Democrats seeking socially-conservative independent voters.                
                

            
                The real question for conservative Democrats now is whether any voters will think they are not actually Democrats because of stunts such as avoiding  the national convention.                
                

            
                In Pennsylvania’s 12th District, the campaign manager for Rep. Critz’s Republican opponent doubts skipping the Charlotte convention will do it.                
                

            
                Rep. Critz “can run from President Obama all he wants …,” said Jon Raso. “This is just the latest ploy … to distance himself from the president in desperation of saving his political career.”                
                

            
                Maybe Obama will throw a wrench in Critz’s plan by endorsing him.

ABC = Always Biased Coverage?,"Wed, 17 Jun 2009 18:35:35 +0000 –  By Peter RoffFellow, Institute for Liberty/Former Senior Political Writer, United Press International                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It should come as little surprise that the once venerable ABC News has announced it would broadcast an upcoming edition of its ""World News"" from the White House's Blue Room, followed by a national town hall meeting on healthcare held in the East Room and presided over by President Barack Obama.                
                

            
                It's a ratings stunt, easily explained by the fact that the network needs them so badly. Tuesday's Nielsen ratings - which the network disputes - show that ABC's evening news broadcast is attracting its smallest audience in decades.                
                

            
                ------------                
                

            
                
 The important thing for Republicans is to be part of the debate, not whine about being excluded.
                
                

            
                ------------                
                

            
                More than that, however, it's politics in the media at its worst. By turning the network over to Obama to pitch the American people on his healthcare reform plan, ABC has joined the lobbying arm of the White House and the Democratic Party. The presentation that will be made to the American people will not be, to borrow a phrase, ""fair and balanced."" Instead, it will include no viewpoint other than Obama's, despite ABC's promise that the network - and the network ""alone will select those who will be in the audience asking questions of the president,"" said ABC News Senior Vice President Kerry Smith.                
                

            
                That the network has chosen to throw in with the president on healthcare reform is little surprise. The director of communications at the White House Office of Health Reform is former ABC News reporter Linda Douglass, who left the network to join Obama's campaign. And it doesn't take too much creativity to imagine that she probably helped broker a deal between her new boss and her old.                
                

            
                Leaving that aside, however, the Republican and conservative response to the announced programming was, as is typical, to whine that they were not being included. Begging for scraps from the monarch's table is the wrong strategy.                
                

            
                The right strategy is to come up with ideas of their own, like buying television ads that would appear throughout the day laying out the case for the patient-based approach to healthcare reform and why it is superior to the government-run approach. Of course this would depend on ABC's willingness to put the ads on the air, something it told the group Conservatives for Patients' Rights it would not do Wednesday afternoon after it asked to buy time just before the town meeting went on the air.                
                

            
                The right strategy has the proponents of the patient-centered approach to healthcare committing to holding a televised town meeting of their own, where attendance is not governed by the need to be cleared into the White House by the Secret Service.                
                

            
                It's all well and good to point out that ABC Chief Washington Correspondent George Stephanopoulos is a former Clinton White House aide who helped craft major policy initiatives like HillaryCare. And that ""World News"" anchor Charlie Gibson helped torpedo Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential election by asking her questions he himself could not answer and whose terms he could not define; but neither fact, while true, helps define the positions in the debate over healthcare reform.                
                

            
                The important thing is to be part of the debate, not whine about being excluded.

At least one group of Americans loves ObamaCare,"Now Playing                            Political fallout over ObamaCare continues                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Take a quick glance at ObamaCare’s busted multimillion-dollar website and the 3.5 million health insurance cancelation notices hitting American mailboxes and you might be tempted to dub the whole thing a disaster. But it’s not -- at least not for the politically-connected crony companies and big money Obama fundraisers poaching your tax dollars to fix the debacle they helped create.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As CNBC recently put it: “Thanks to ObamaCare, the health-care industry is going to get a big makeover during the coming years and venture capitalists have wasted no time looking for ways to cash in.” Put simply, ObamaCare’s complexity and catastrophic rollout create rivers of cash for Obama’s cronies.                
                

            
                So who are some of the winners in the ObamaCare crony capitalist giveaway?                
                

            
                For those on the left who thought that ObamaCare would mean large health insurance companies might get their comeuppance, they might want to look at UnitedHealth. Wall Street analysts expect the giant to see its stock price rise 40 percent over the next two years, thanks to expanding profit margins. The company has also won big contracts to help implement the rollout. Quality Software Services, Inc., a major contractor for Healthcare.gov, is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth. One of President Obama’s most reliable fundraisers in both 2008 and 2012 was Anthony Welters, executive vice president of UnitedHealth. He raised more than $500,000 for the 2012 election, according to opensecrets.org                
                

            
                Another big ObamaCare winner is tech giant Qualcomm. In 2011, the company created a subsidiary called Qualcomm Life specifically designed to profit off ObamaCare changes. The company offers products to securely transfer data between wireless health care devices. Thanks to ObamaCare, company executives believe that “wireless solutions are going to be looked at more prominently.” Former Qualcomm Chairman Irwin Jacobs raised more than $500,000 for Obama’s re-election in 2012.

                Also poised to do well is Obama bundler David Friedman, founder of Sandy River Health Systems, which works in health care, nursing homes, and long-term care. Friedman raised more than $500,000 for Obama’s re-election in 2012.                
                

            
                Obama bundlers who are private equity investors also stand to make a mint. Obama bundler Jay Snyder (he raised more than $500,000) heads up HBJ Investments, which was founded by his father.  HBJ invests in health care medical companies and pharmaceuticals positioned to cash in on ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Vice President Al Gore and investor David Blood head up investment firm Generational Investment Management. The company may be known for backing green energy businesses, but earlier this year Generational Investment Management invested heavily in health care stocks -- a full 27 percent of the portfolio for Generation Investment Management LLP is made up of health care investments. Predictably, Gore and Blood’s firm is expected to cash in on ObamaCare.  And, predictably, Blood bundled more than $500,000 for Obama in 2012.                
                

            
                Bundler Robert Pohlad (who bundled more than $500,000 for Obama in 2012) is the head of Pohlad Companies, which has a subsidiary called Arcadia Solutions, a software company that is selling software to hospitals and doctors affected by healthcare reform.                
                

            
                ObamaCare is also spurring a growing number of mergers among hospitals and other health care providers, according to The New York Times.  As another paper notes,  “Because of all the new regulations and changes to how hospitals are paid, look for more mergers and consolidation.” This creates opportunities for Wall Street dealmakers like Evercore Partners, which, in September, hired away Matthew McAskin from Goldman Sachs where he was the co-head of the Healthcare Services Investment Banking unit. In its announcement, Evercore noted that McAskin “has advised on a number of the most recent notable transactions in the hospital, managed care, HCIT, physician services and outsourced medical services subsectors” and that “health care represents one of the largest and most active industries for investment banking services.” Evercore boasted at least two big dollar bundlers for Obama, the most prominent bundler being Roger Altman, co-chair of the company, who bundled between $200,000 and $500,000 for Obama in 2012.                  
                

            
                Another big Obama fundraiser who stands to profit from the ObamaCare debacle is Alexa Wesner of Austin Ventures. The investment firm has big stakes in Emerus Hospital Partners, LLC, ESO Solutions (which offers software to the health care industry), and Explorys, Inc., which hopes to leverage “big data” in the health care sphere. Wesner bundled over $500,000 for Obama in 2012                
                

            
                ObamaCare may be a disaster for the millions of Americans whose health insurance plans are being canceled, the millions of Americans who cannot use the government’s website, and the taxpayers forced to foot the bill for the boondoggle. But make no mistake -- at least one group of Americans loves ObamaCare: the president’s big money backers and cronies who stand to bag millions of your tax dollars amid the mess.

Why this doctor is glad that Trump wants to take on big pharma (and protect  Americans from drug makers' greed),"Now Playing                            Trump: You're going to be proud of plan to replace ObamaCare                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Health care reform has been a big part of the election of 2016.  While the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) has taken center stage, many have wondered what may happen to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under a Trump presidency.  Wednesday, President-elect Trump made the answer quite clear — no more price gouging.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In the last year, we have all heard about the significant price hikes of the Epi Pen made by Mylan pharmaceuticals. Mylan and CEO Heather Bresch are just one example of price gouging, price fixing and collusion among pharmaceutical companies.                 
                

            
                Many other drugs are also increasing in cost at alarming rates, without any real plausible explaination. Most concerning is the fact that while consumers have seen a 500 percent increase in the cost of the Epi Pen, Ms Bresch has seen a nearly 700 percent increase in her own salary over the last few years.                
                

            
                Mylan is definitely not alone in its greed. Last year the CEO of Turing, Martin Shkreli increased the price of an important (and relatively cheap) drug in the treatment of HIV related illness nearly 5000 percent.                
                

            
                Countless other cases of inflated drug prices have come to light in recent months.                 
                

            
                In Europe, a precedent has been set when in late 2016 drug maker Pfizer was fined a record 85 million pounds by the National Health Service for unfairly raising the price of an old epilepsy drug by 2,400 percent.                 
                

            
                It is clear that price gouging is not limited to newly developed or expensive biologic/designer drugs–even the price of insulin (which has been around for decades) has gone up nearly 300 percent.                
                

            
                Insulin and other medicines like it are drugs that are used to treat common diseases (like diabetes) that many patients NEED daily just in order to LIVE.                
                

            
                 Are we now going to allow some in the pharmaceutical industry to maximize their profits at the expense of the health of children with Type I diabetes?                 
                

            
                Wednesday, President-elect Trump took dead aim at the pharmaceutical industry in his noon press conference.  He made it clear that he will take steps to regulate the pharmaceutical industry because “they are getting away with murder”.                   
                

            
                Mr. Trump stated that he will seek to immediately allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices—no longer will government programs be forced to pay whatever pharmaceutical companies ask.                 
                

            
                He suggested that open bidding by suppliers to provide drugs for Medicare would be an important way to manage cost and potentially save billions of healthcare dollars.                 
                

            
                Mr. Trump noted that the pharmaceutical lobby has been a dominant force in Washington and has been instrumental in keeping prices high. It appears that the President-elect will take quick steps to address the growing national crisis of drug costs.                  
                

            
                Currently the U.S. pays far more for drugs than any other developed nation. We bear the costs of research and development for the rest of the world.  While it is critical to innovation that we reward new developments, we must create limits to how much (and for how long) drug makers can charge exorbitant prices.                 
                

            
                Its Time that We Hold Pharmaceutical Executives Accountable                
                

            
                As a physician and patient advocate, one of the biggest barriers to treatment in my practice is the cost of therapy.                 
                

            
                 Patients want to get well and want to do what is needed to stay healthy. However, many simply cannot afford to purchase their medications—even with assistance programs.                  
                

            
                Pharmaceutical companies MUST do better and I believe that  President Trump will work to make sure that they provide quality products at AFFORDABLE prices in the future.                 
                

            
                 Congress MUST look at amending patent protection laws and must also review the rules and regulations concerning the production and cost of generic medications.                  
                

            
                We must allow Americans to purchase drugs from reputable pharmacies from Canada and other locations in order to lower costs at home.                  
                

            
                Most importantly we must ensure that our government does not overpay for common, low cost drugs simply to line the pockets of pharmaceutical executives and shareholders.                 
                

            
                Initially following the election, drug stocks soared as investors anticipated less regulation and more free market competition in this space.                  
                

            
                Wednesday, things retreated immediately following his comments with the health sector already down several percentage points.  Mylan and Bristol Myers Squibb immediately dropped nearly 4 percent while others such as Pfizer and and Allergan dropped 3 percent.                  
                

            
                It  is my hope that leaders in the pharmaceutical world will begin to work with Mr. Trump and Congress to find better and most cost effective ways to lower the cost of needed and life saving prescription drugs.                 
                

            
                 It appears that with the signing of the 21st Century Cures Act in December, the process for getting drugs approved by the FDA will become much more streamlined and less costly—providing a cost reduction to the pharmaceutical and device industries that should be passed along to patients.                
                

            
                I believe that in his press conference Wednesday, President-elect Trump showed that he is going to stand up for patients and work to reduce the cost of health care in the U.S.                 
                

            
                While drug prices are just one aspect of a very complex system, I think that it is a great place to start.                  
                

            
                Finally, my patients may be able to afford their pills.

America Loses Its Cool,"JetBlue flight attendant Steven Slater snaps, hurls obscenities, grabs some beer and slides down an emergency exit – tossing away a 28-year career. And he smiles on his way to lockup. An angry customer “loses her cool at an Ohio McDonald’s.” She gets upset they stopped selling Chicken McNuggets, so she attacks several employees through the drive-thru window and goes to jail.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Even Obama Press Secretary Robert Gibbs got into the act, bashing liberal critics. Those who think Obama is “like George Bush,” he said, “ought to be drug-tested.” Gibbs later recanted, calling his complaints “inartful.”                
                

            
                High unemployment, high stress and even higher temperatures have people steamed coast to coast. “In the U.S. Midwest, excessive heat warnings were issued for nine states along the Mississippi River and a heat advisory covers parts of seven more, the weather service said yesterday,” wrote Bloomberg Aug. 10. Many of the states that aren’t sweltering now, have been in recent weeks.                
                

            
                To put it simply: America is losing its cool.                
                

            
                If you are the party in power, that’s seldom good. Last year’s town hall battles over supposed healthcare reform escalated during the August recess. Much of our nation’s history of unrest happened in warmer weather – civil rights protests, race riots, the Stonewall riot and more. When it’s hot, tempers fray more quickly. Anger and resentment turn into heated confrontation. “Fight the power” can turn quickly to “burn, baby, burn.”                
                

            
                Only the Russians seem to revolt in the cold. It’s the summer of our discontent that really matters. Americans celebrate our revolution in the heat of July. So do the French. Their fight against the monarchy went on for a long time, but they stormed the Bastille on July 14.                
                

            
                In 2010, American disgust at all things revolting in Washington is boiling over. This year there are more reasons for anger than we’ve had for a long time. For starters, try 9.5 percent unemployment, 14.6 million unemployed, another 1.2 million discouraged and a White House prediction it won’t get any better until 2012.                
                

            
                Public sentiment is so strong that ABC tracks what it calls “America’s Frustration Index.” According to anchor George Stephanopoulos, dissatisfaction is “the most we’ve seen in wave election years.” As contributor Matthew Dowd explained: “In this election, suburbia is swinging back at Washington.”                
                

            
                Who can blame them? Everywhere ordinary Americans turn, the politicians they elected have turned against them or are turning their backs. The deficit is projected to be $1.47 trillion and to top $1 trillion each year for the foreseeable future. The economic recovery promised by the mega-stimulus hasn’t taken hold and Congress is trying to pass another stimulus. They’ve passed so many that this one isn’t a sequel to the one before but a prequel to the next.                
                

            
                Ethics allegations against top Democrats in Congress Charlie Rangel and Maxine Waters are showing Democratic promises of good behavior are worth the same as promises to read the bills they pass. New York Times columnist and Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman spoke for the rest of the liberal political class when he told ABC’s “This Week” the massive ethics investigation against the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, “really has no national significance.”                
                

            
                On core value issues like immigration, gay marriage and the insanely misguided New York mosque plan, middle America is left out of the decision-making process so the P.C. crowd can pander to the new protected classes that promise votes and contributions.                
                

            
                The oil crisis in the Gulf has passed but cleanup remains, and both highlight the failure of government to prevent, solve or clean up a problem. America’s two wars continue as brave men and women risk their lives while some anti-American idiot at Wikileaks.org releases classified material putting them at risk.                
                

            
                With a huge assist from the Bush administration, Obama has created the worst of all possible worlds – a high-tax, low-performance government – sort of a trillion-dollar Yugo. America, even The Washington Post admits in its series called “Top Secret America,” is so overwhelmed that it can’t even fight the war on terror in any organized fashion.                
                

            
                Thanks to maturing technologies of Twitter, blogs and online video, Americans are aware of every item on this list, and they’re steamed. Rather than blame Washington, the equally out-of-touch media have been blaming the citizens themselves. MSNBC’s Chris Matthews summed it up by criticizing Republicans for “pandering to angry white people.” Bill Clinton’s former labor secretary Robert Reich warned of the scary threat of “angry right-wing populism.”                
                

            
                More than any other group, the Tea Parties have channeled America’s anger at Washington. The media haven’t pulled any punches, calling tea parties “angry,” “nasty” and “Astroturf.” In the past year alone, ABC, CBS and NBC mentioned some form of “anger” associated with the Tea Parties 178 times, according to Nexis.                
                

            
                As each day passes and the election looms, it seems the anger grows. Wildfires burn out of control in Russia, but political wildfires are catching here. Politicians aren’t trying to solve our problems or even listen. Instead, they foolishly think their added hot air will cool a nation’s anger.                
                

            
                Sometimes it isn’t the heat, it’s the stupidity.

Midterm election strategy: Republican principles for American renewal,"Now Playing                            Exclusive: Reince Priebus on GOP's midterm election strategy                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Editor's note: This op-ed is based on a speech Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus delivered on Thursday, October 2, 2014 at the George Washington University.

                With 32 days until Election Day, it’s clearer than ever that Americans aren’t happy with the president or his party. Far more Americans disapprove of the job President Obama’s doing than approve—as has been the case for almost a year and a half. His signature policy, ObamaCare, is as unpopular as ever.
 
 Republicans offer an alternative, and Americans know we oppose many of the president’s policies. Yet as Americans head to the polls, it’s important that voters know not just what we oppose but also what we support.  To that end, I have released the Principles for American Renewal, eleven core principles that unite Republicans across the country and up and down the ballot.
 
 As a party, our overarching vision is a country that offers equal opportunity for everyone. In pursuit of that vision, our party’s three values have long been a strong economy, a strong society, and a strong defense. The Principles for American Renewal fit into those three categories and cover eleven vital topics.                
                

            
                [pullquote]
 
 I outlined these in detail in a speech on October 2.
 
 Number one: Our Constitution should be preserved, valued and honored.
 
 Our Constitution is the source of “American exceptionalism.” It’s the wisdom of our Founders and the foundation of all good policy.
 
 The practical effect of a commitment to the Constitution is restoring power to “we, the people.” From our work to eliminate poverty to our efforts to improve education and healthcare, states need the ability to respond to their residents’ needs. This doesn’t just make Constitutional sense, it should be common sense.
 
 Number two: We need to start growing America’s economy instead of Washington’s economy so that working Americans see better wages and more opportunity.
 
 Over-taxing and over-regulating create jobs for the wrong people: Lobbyists and bureaucrats in DC. As money pours into D.C., they take jobs away from the people that need them: Middle class moms and dads, young people just out of high school or college, and minority communities where unemployment is above average.
 
 Number three: We need to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, make government more efficient, and leave the next generation with opportunity, not debt.
 
 We are leaving each child born today a share of our almost $18 trillion dollar national debt, a debt for every child that’s over $55,000. How is that fair?
 
 Today, businesses run more efficiently. Our homes run more efficiently. Yet our federal government gets bigger, slower, and more expensive. It makes no sense. We can apply some 21st century efficiency to 20th century bureaucracy, save money, and balance the budget.
 
 Number four: We need to start over with real healthcare reform that puts patients and their doctors in charge, not unelected bureaucrats in Washington.
 
 We need healthcare solutions that reduce costs, provide greater access to world-class care, and give Americans more control over their healthcare decisions, but ObamaCare gave Washington, DC, more control over our healthcare—and patients and doctors less. It also failed to make healthcare more affordable.
 
 Number five: Our veterans have earned our respect and gratitude, and no veteran should have to wait in line for months or years just to see a doctor.
 
 Other scandals and issues have knocked the VA out of the news now, but that doesn’t mean everything’s fixed. Republicans will be vigilant to ensure that the VA gets its act together and no one who risks their life for our country dies waiting to see a doctor. The most important thing is making sure veterans get the care they need. It shouldn’t matter if it’s in a VA facility or not.
 
 Number six: Keeping America safe and strong requires a strong military, growing the economy, energy independence, and secure borders.
 
 The federal government has no greater responsibility than keeping us safe.
 
 With ISIS, we face an enemy who wants Americans dead and our way of life destroyed. We need leaders who will defeat terrorism, not manage it. We need leaders who will act decisively, not downplay the threat as “JV.” We need leaders who will take responsibility, not blame the intelligence community. This is no time to weaken our military.
 
 Number seven: Every child should have an equal opportunity to get a great education; no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing school.
 
 Educational access is the civil rights issue of our day, and school choice is one of the most effective ways to expand access. We want more ways to help disadvantaged kids get out of bad schools and into good ones. That’s why Governor Kasich of Ohio quadrupled the number of EdChoice scholarships in his state. That’s why Louisiana expanded its scholarship program under Governor Jindal.
 
 Number eight: The best anti-poverty program is a strong family and a good job, so our focus should be on getting people out of poverty by lifting up all people and helping them find work.
 
 We need an effective safety net, but the federal government’s anti-poverty programs have become mismanaged and ineffective. We should restructure and consolidate them, give more power to the states, and actually measure the results. Doing the same old thing gets the same old results. 45 million of our fellow Americans are living in poverty.
 
 Number nine: Our country should value the traditions of family, life, religious liberty, and hard work.
 
 These values make our country great. We need to fix the policies that discourage marriage. We need to support a culture of life. We need to fight for protecting the rights to free exercise and free expression. And we need to uphold the value of hard work, which we pass on through our families and communities, and which built our country.
 
 Number ten: We should make America energy independent by encouraging investment in domestic energy, lowering prices, and creating jobs at home.
 
 America is blessed with abundant resources. What we don’t need is Washington, DC, picking and choosing what energy we can use. We have to build the Keystone Pipeline. It’s good for jobs and national security. Democrats say they don’t want that oil because they don’t want to burn fossil fuels. But opposing the pipeline means the oil gets shipped to China. And I can promise it’s not getting over there in a Prius.
 
 Number eleven: We need an immigration system that secures our borders, upholds the law, and boosts our economy.
 
 Border security must come first. The humanitarian crisis at the border made that clear. The president’s plan to overlook the border crisis and act unilaterally to rewrite our immigration laws is unacceptable and unconstitutional. His plan to make further changes to the system after the election will only make any fix harder. We can’t reward those who break the laws, and we need to make sure America remains a place where people aspire to work and dream to live.
 
 ***
 
 If anyone asks, “How’s the Republican Party going to work for me?” these principles are part of the answer. They’re not everything. Other leaders have also put forward their positive agendas that uphold these principles. While one election won’t fix everything, we can take a step in the right direction this November. If the American people hire us, we’ll be ready on day one."
"Douglas Schoen: Trump's leadership, promises at risk now that health care vote has been postponed","President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting on women in healthcare, Wednesday, March 22, 2017, in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

                Just one year ago, as Donald Trump’s Republican primary opponents were uniformly dropping out of the 2016 Presidential race, many long-time party members feared their party’s presumptive nominee would be unable to unite the party by Election Day.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Riding a populist wave through November though, Trump would manage to allay those concerns in a remarkable upset victory.                
                

            
                Today, however, the Republican postponement of the American Health Care Act signals not only that Trump is still unable to unite his party, but that his ability to lead and deliver on his many promises is in serious jeopardy.                 
                

            
                Given this postponement, the Republicans are now forced to delay tax reform, delay any and all plans for infrastructure investment, and, of course, delay repealing and replacing Obamacare with a new healthcare program, which in the President’s words would provide, “insurance for everybody.”                 
                

            
                As a result of this log-jam, the favorable economic data and stock market rallies Trump has frequently cited as early successes may very well screech to a halt too.                
                

            
                In the ongoing healthcare debate, it is true that Trump and the Republicans have been bogged down by an anti-establishment, anti-media narrative, yet that “fake news” spiral is largely of their own making.                
                

            
                Stemming from both the White House and Congressional Republicans, unfounded accusations of surveillance and perpetuating controversy around the President’s ties to Russia does absolutely nothing to deliver reforms to hard-working Americans whose quality of life is at risk in our broken healthcare system.                
                

            
                Ultimately, the Republicans’ inability to take action under Trump’s leadership on issues and policies that directly impact the voters who sent them to Washington, let alone the millions of moderate Americans seeking tax relief and pro-growth economic reforms, will have significant consequences.                  
                

            
                The postponement on healthcare in particular comes after multiple weeks in which seemingly the only thing the Republican Conference could make clear to the public was that they could not agree on anything.                 
                

            
                One month ago, many believed that Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress would mark a new beginning for compromise within the Republican party and forge cooperation across party lines.                 
                

            
                Yet today’s developments underscore that Trump has been unable to build broad support for a national reforms agenda that delivers on his, or any Republicans’ for that matter, important promises to their voters.                
                

            
                Above all, the Trump White House and Republican-led Congress need to promote policies that work.                 
                

            
                If as many as 14 million people will conceivably no have health coverage one year from today, and if the healthcare exchanges are going to fall apart, then the Republicans clearly have not put forward a serious plan to fix healthcare in this country.                
                

            
                Right now, it seems the one thing Republicans have going for them is the Democratic Party’s terribly unsound strategy of resistance at every step.                
                

            
                If the Republicans can find opportunities to truly, forge compromise, and actually get something accomplished, they can quickly get back on track with Trump’s pro-growth agenda.                
                

            
                The importance of developing a new Republican strategy on healthcare reform could not be more clear. Trump and Republicans in Congress must go to the American people with a bipartisan plan that achieves the goals of affordable, easy to access healthcare. That is something they can sell.

                As the 115th Congress begins, I am honored to assume a new role as Interim Chair of the House Budget Committee.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is an exciting opportunity, particularly as the first woman to fill the position, but more than any title before my name, I’m still most proud of the two letters that follow: “R.N.”                
                

            
                I graduated from nursing school in 1971 and still keep my license today. Those years on the front lines of patient care, primarily in emergency room settings, inform much of the work I do in Congress – especially when it comes to ObamaCare.                
                

            
                It’s no secret that Congressional Republicans aren’t keen on former President Obama’s health care law (of course, recent polling shows that a majority of Americans still aren’t either) but, for me, the debate has never been about politics. It’s personal.                
                

            
                As a nurse, I saw the impact of health care decisions in Washington play out every day on my patients’ faces and in their billing statements.                
                

            
                I understand the need for healthcare reform as well as anyone, but ObamaCare wasn’t the way to do it – and nowhere is that more deeply felt than in my home state of Tennessee.                
                

            
                In 2013, 28,000 Tennesseans lost their insurance coverage in a single day when a state program called “CoverTN” lapsed after the Obama administration decreed that it ran afoul of the health care law’s top-down requirements.                
                

            
                Two years later, our state’s ObamaCare co-op would follow suit, leaving thousands in a scramble for coverage.                
                

            
                Today, Tennesseans are seeing an average 63 percent premium spike and 73 of our 95 counties have a single option to choose from on the Obamacare exchange.                
                

            
                Our state insurance commissioner didn’t mince words last year when she described the marketplace as “very near collapse” but even that characterization is generous. When three-fourths of your state lacks any choice among insurers, it’s no longer a marketplace at all – it’s a monopoly.                
                

            
                Sadly, Tennessee has seen this movie before, and we know exactly how it ends. A similar government-run program, called TennCare, failed in our state less than 15 years ago.                
                

            
                First enacted in 1994, this program dramatically expanded Medicaid eligibility to just about anyone that wanted it, including healthy, insurable adults who simply lacked employer-sponsored coverage.                
                

            
                Costs for TennCare quickly exploded, rising 146 percent over a ten-year window with little to show in the way of improved health outcomes.                
                

            
                In 2001, BlueCross Blue Shield, which covered half of all TennCare patients, threatened to pull out of the program because of massive losses and, by 2004, an independent audit revealed TennCare was on track to bankrupt Tennessee.                
                

            
                Like ObamaCare, TennCare couldn’t deliver on its promises. Both programs found themselves mired in court cases, unable to attract healthy adults, struggling to keep insurers, crippled by a lack of proper verification for eligibility, and ultimately failing to bend the health care cost curve.                
                

            
                It was ultimately a Democrat Governor, Phil Bredesen, who scaled back TennCare to a traditional Medicaid model, admitting “Our experience with trying to do universal coverage ended up being a disaster.""                
                

            
                Now, Tennesseans are experiencing a bad case of déjà vu.                
                

            
                Following the clear mandate from American voters last fall – and keeping the lessons of TennCare in mind – Congressional Republicans recently took the first steps towards the repeal of ObamaCare.                
                

            
                The debate on the House floor over the legislation was spirited, with Democrats claiming that supporters of repeal are pulling the rug out from millions of Americans, but their argument falls short.                
                

            
                For every person that ObamaCare loyalists claim has been helped by this law, another has opted out of the law altogether. Indeed, between the number of people who claimed an exemption from ObamaCare penalties and those who paid the fines – some 20 million Americans are rejecting ObamaCare outright.                
                

            
                Washington types fail to understand that by repealing and replacing ObamaCare, we are not disrupting a system that is working, we are offering a rescue plan to stop the bleeding and transition away from a law that already failed by every measure. That also means offering a stable transition period, so that no one falls through the cracks, and then offering a path to something better.                
                

            
                If President Obama’s infamous pledge that “If you like your plan, you can keep it” was the greatest lie surrounding ObamaCare, then a close second is the claim that Republicans have no alternative.                
                

            
                For example, Speaker Paul Ryan filed the Patients Choice Act during the same session of Congress ObamaCare was passed. Unsurprisingly, the Democratic majority wouldn’t give the bill consideration.                
                

            
                More recently, my Tennessee colleague, Congressman Phil Roe, a physician by trade, offered the American Health Care Reform Act and Congressman Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon, introduced the Empowering Patients First Act.                
                

            
                While the exact details of these bills vary, they all center on solutions that expand choice, force insurers to compete for patients’ business, protect our most vulnerable, and work to drive down the cost of care.                
                

            
                Last summer, House Republicans put many of these solutions together in a detailed, 37-page policy blueprint called “A Better Way” for health care reform.                
                

            
                The House will legislate on an ObamaCare replacement bill that meets the contours of that plan this year.                
                

            
                Nearly seven years after ObamaCare became law on a party line vote, we can say with certainty that we’ve tried health care reform the Washington way and it didn’t work.                
                

            
                Now, it’s time to try a better way – with solutions that trust patients over politicians and that offer Americans the care they want without forcing them to buy into a product they don’t need.                
                

            
                This nurse is ready to roll up her sleeves and get to work.

Freedom Caucus drives dagger into heart of young Trump presidency,"Now Playing                            Trump pulls the plug on the GOP plan to repeal ObamaCare                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                It is hard to overestimate the damage the Freedom Caucus has done to the fledgling presidency of Donald Trump, and to the country. By blocking the American Health Care Act of 2017, the conservative group has guaranteed that Americans will struggle forward under the burden of Obamacare. In the next few months insurers will announce their premium hikes for the coming year; chances are, given the continuing withdrawal of major companies from the marketplaces and the ongoing failure of the bill to attract enough young and healthy participants, the new rates will not be pretty. Last year premiums went up 25%; it’s likely the increases will be higher this year.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Republicans will own those higher rates. Their failure to repeal the financial underpinnings of Obamacare and start replacing that failing program with an approach that encourages competition and that embodies numerous other common sense reforms will mean that families hit by ever-higher costs will blame the GOP. Voters elected Donald Trump and a GOP Congress to get this job done – the number one promise of every Republican campaign since 2010.                
                

            
                Now the Republican Party inherits the Sisyphean task of managing Obamacare’s inevitable decline. They are no longer critics; they are now the producers of the show. It is unlikely that House Speaker Paul Ryan or Trump will have the political will and patience to return to the drawing board and attempt to craft a brand new bill. They have made other commitments to voters, and so Obamacare, as a defeated Paul Ryan admitted after withdrawing the AHCA, is the law of the land. Live with it.                
                

            
                Of course, the damage is not limited to healthcare reform. The undermining of the House leadership is profound and clouds prospects of tax reform, infrastructure spending and other important jobs to be done. If Ryan cannot be counted on to herd the cats on healthcare, how do we know he can round up votes on tax reform?                
                

            
                It is the young Trump presidency, however, that takes the biggest hit here. Trump was elected because people across the political spectrum thought he could fix some of our problems. He was the businessman who could import common sense to Washington, and the deal maker who could bring people together. He made big promises; a country tired of stalemate and disappointment believed that he could bring back jobs, reduce our debt, build the wall, find a better healthcare solution.                
                

            
                His credibility and credentials now lie in tatters. All that optimism that has stoked the stock market and boosted investment plans – all that may fade.                
                

            
                Who is to blame? House Speaker Paul Ryan will be dragged through the mud for failing to win enough votes. He will also be criticized for concocting an arguably complicated and overly cerebral approach to the mission at hand. The AHCA was only part of the solution; Ryan vowed to press forward with more changes – like allowing insurers to compete across state lines, expanded health savings accounts and Medicaid reforms – in future legislation. It was a complex three-step approach; framing a sales pitch was all but impossible.                
                

            
                He was hemmed in by the strictures of reconciliation, through which Obamacare was to be dismantled but even so, it was a hard story to tell. Once the CBO published their score, showing that 24 million would lose coverage by 2026, Nancy Pelosi and her colleagues were off to the races, souring the country on Ryan’s bill. Few noted that subsequent measures would make the numbers significantly more appealing. Negative polling encouraged those keen to defeat it, and defeat it they did.                
                

            
                Nancy Pelosi mocked Trump for bringing the bill to the floor before he had the votes; that won’t sit well with a president who likes winning. So far, he is blaming Democrats, but he will doubtless find others – including perhaps the Speaker – to chastise for the loss. That will be unfortunate. As an outsider, President Trump has to rely on some seasoned hands to move bills through Congress; notwithstanding this recent defeat, Vice President Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan are an excellent and necessary team. Relying on executive orders, as Obama did, produces unsustainable measures easily overturned by the courts.                
                

            
                Outraged Republicans should save most of their ire for the Freedom Caucus. The group of 30-odd conservatives are patting themselves on the backs this evening; joining their celebration are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Hillary Clinton declared the failure a victory, while disgusted Republicans across the country wonder how it went so wrong.                
                

            
                Caucus leader Mark Meadows, who hails from western North Carolina, may find himself under scrutiny. People may wonder why the American Society of Anesthesiologists was one of the top five funders of Meadows’ campaign and why health professionals were among the top five industries donating to his reelection in 2016. Medical groups typically like Obamacare, which provides healthcare services to an expanded population. Did they count on Meadows undermining Obamacare repeal? Did they know that thanks to his efforts, Obamacare would carry on?                
                

            
                Meadows could well find himself with a primary challenger in 2018 who promises to support Donald Trump. After all, Trump carried North Carolina, and especially the western regions.                  
                

            
                And Meadows may not be alone. The National Republican Congressional Committee has been hauling in record amounts of money these past few months – money that can go to fielding candidates that support the White House. The Chair of the NRCC is Ohio’s Steve Stivers, who was a yes vote for the AHCA. His predecessor at the NRCC was Oregon Representative Greg Walden, who campaigned all-out for the AHCA. It’ unlikely either Stivers or Walden will champion the reelection of Meadows or his colleagues.                 
                

            
                The Trump White House is apparently going to move on to the other items on the agenda. The country will watch to see if the administration can bring tax reform about. With Democrats obstructing every move, nothing will be easy. But with Democrats and the Freedom Caucus standing in the way of the Trump agenda, nearly everything becomes impossible.

God in the Voting Booth,"Aside from the obvious jokes about how crowded it can get when God joins us in the voting booth, many religious people bring their faith with them when they cast their ballots. In fact, how could it be otherwise? Voting shapes the culture and society in which we live. For people whose religious beliefs are not simply about personal salvation or getting into heaven, but actually have aspirations for how life in the here and now is shaped, turning toward their chosen tradition is a given, as it should be.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Religion is not something we check at the voting booth door and it would be oddly oppressive to ask people of faith to do so. What is not oppressive is insisting that those same religious people not demand that all people follow their chosen faith.                
                

            
                Religious people need an ethic of voting which both honors their tradition, including its views on specific policies, while also honoring that we live in a country built upon the notion that all people are entitled to the same respect, regardless of the tradition they follow. They also need to think carefully about what it means to honor their chosen tradition.                
                

            
                For example, if more children would die from lack of healthcare than from abortions, assuming one believes that a child dies when an abortion is performed, which is really the sanctity of life issue? In that case, one could argue that supporting a candidate who favors radical healthcare reform and a woman’s right to choose is actually the more “Catholic decision!”                
                

            
                I know that various religious groups have tried to own specific issues as defining the acceptability of a candidate, but buying into those definitions reduces rich traditions to single issues. How sad for the followers of those traditions.                
                

            
                There are Jewish teachings on pretty much everything, and narrowing the definition of what makes a candidate more Jewishly acceptable to those issues which either primarily effect Jews, or which Jews have tried to own, turns a thousands-year-old tradition into a short list of talking points. Talk about tragic!                
                

            
                But it’s not only religious folks who turn to their most deeply held beliefs when voting; don’t many secular people bring their commitment to secularism with them when they vote? And despite what many will claim, the two are not so different from each other.                
                

            
                As in the case of religious folk who turn to the teachings they hold most dear when they vote, secular people do the same thing. They may call it their conscience or “doing what they think is best”, but it’s no different simply because they don’t appeal to God.                
                

            
                In all cases, the issue is not who or what we bring with us into the voting booth. The real issue is how much respect for others we bring with us when we vote, and how much appreciation of the fact that commitment to any world view is always more complex than one’s position on a single issue.                
                

            
                Responsible voters, religious or secular, should not bracket pieces of who they are when they vote. In fact, they need to expand their understanding of who they are and what their chosen tradition teaches. When they do that, they will not have to choose between respect for their faith and respect for the rest of us who do not share it – at least not nearly as often as we are led to believe we must.

However, both President Clinton and the Obama communications team have repeatedly made clear that this was a private humanitarian mission,not one where he represents the current president in any way.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Hillary Clinton has been dispatched on an 11 day trip to Africa, a region with severe humanitarian concerns that need to be addressed by the US, but not one that ranks in the top five of America's urgent foreign policy problems.                 
                

            
                With both Clintons out of the country, news agencies dubbed Tuesday, August 4, ""Obama Day."" -- Okay, it was also his birthday, but I cannot help but think that the Clintons are unhappy about being pushed away from the center of power, especially since both Bill and Hillary anticipated that theywould be them residing in the White House in August of 2009 and not the Obamas.                
                

            
                History quiz: Who was the last sitting president seriously challenged in a primary?                
                

            
                Answer: Jimmy Carter taken on by Ted Kennedy in 1980.                
                

            
                Fast forward 32 years and the possibility of a redux is becoming more and more real with each percentage point President Obama's rating slides.  Unlikely? At this stage, yes, but definitely possible and made more so by the circumstances.                
                

            
                Who? The answer is obvious; the same person who carried 1,973 delegates and 23 states and territories in the 2008 democratic primaries, who currently possesses substantial campaign funds and who, while supposedly pledging not to run in any more campaigns, has kept a staff larger than some Senators up for reelection in 2010 -- the current Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.                
                

            
                The same person whose husband, the only two-term Democrat president since FDR, was so ambiguous in his support for Barack Obama during last year's presidential election it was spoofed on NBC's Saturday Night Live:                
                

            
                Actor playing Larry King: ""President Clinton, do you endorse Barack Obama?""                
                

            
                Actor playing President Clinton: ""Barack Obama is my party's candidate for presidency, and I am not a party wrecker...I love to party!!!""                
                

            
                The truth is that President Clinton was willing to say anything to avoid clearly supporting a man he had, and likely continues to, disdain. The former president Clinton thinks Obama stole from Hillary something she deserves: the presidency.                
                

            
                Hillary Clinton herself has openly criticized President Obama, specifically the vetting process and the president's ability to fill the departments associated with her position as Secretary of State, such as the Agency for International Development. She has also been a very invisible Secretary of State, making it easy for her to step away at some point to prepare her candidacy.                
                

            
                Conventional thinking suggests that if Hillary Clinton wants a shot at the presidency she will wait until 2016, but she is an unconventional individual and these are not conventional times. The combination of the pressures of her age, she will be 69 in 2016 (she was born October 26, 1947), and the window which is becoming more and more open as the current president struggles in his domestic and foreign policy agenda, may make a 2012 run impossible to turn down for this politician who so longed to be her party's nominee she cried about it before the New Hampshire primary.                
                

            
                Any chance of Hillary 2012 goes out the window if two out of three of the following happen 1. healthcare reform is successful; 2. the economic crisis is handled effectively; and/or 3. the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are resolved.  However, if the first six months of this presidency has taught us anything, it is to never overestimate the current administration, but to wait for the results. So far the results are stalled health care reform, a continuing economic crisis --notwithstanding the supposed ""stimulus"" bill -- and a significant upsurge in U.S. casualties in Afghanistan. The result is an approval rating for the president down in the low 50s on par with, that's right, Jimmy Carter's rating 32 years ago 6 months into his Presidency in late July 1977.                
                

            
                Ted Kennedy said in his 1980 DNC concession speech that ""the dream shall never die,"" for Hillary Clinton the dream is to be president of the United States and that dream may be revived much sooner than expected."
"JUAN WILLIAMS: If Capitol Hill Is High School, Michele Bachmann Is the 'It' Girl of the Moment","If Capitol Hill is really one big high school, the “It” girl of the moment is Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.).                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                A recent Gallup poll of Republicans found Bachmann had the second-highest positive intensity rating of any of the potential 2012 candidates in the GOP field. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and my colleague at Fox, came in first.                
                

            
                In the last week alone, newspapers ranging from The New York Times to The Washington Times have run profiles on Bachmann full of speculation about her next move in the GOP presidential contest. She has made numerous trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, suggesting she might make a run for the presidency as either a Republican or a third party, Tea Party-backed candidate. TV’s John McLaughlin declared on his show that Bachmann will be the 2012 Republican nominee for vice president.                
                

            
                But what about Bachmann’s current job?                
                

            
                She is the founder and leader of the 52-member House Tea Party Caucus and serves on two key committees: Intelligence and Financial Services. And in amazing fashion, she now seems to be running her own shadow Republican caucus in which she is speaker, floor leader, whip and conference chairwoman for the Tea Party passions that threaten to split Republicans on the Hill.                
                

            
                She tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up the most recent continuing resolution because of a hitherto unseen $105 billion in healthcare reform funding. She managed to corral 54 “no” votes, mostly from freshmen Republicans, and gave the impression that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) cannot control his own caucus.                
                

            
                Bachmann’s rock-star status on the far right has put the House GOP leadership in a difficult position. She is undermining the ability of the Republican majority in the House to govern.                
                

            
                She raised eyebrows by giving a Tea Party response to the State of the Union, stealing the spotlight from the official Republican respondent, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Bachmann is likely to be in the spotlight again this week with Tea Party Patriots rallying at the Capitol against Republicans in the leadership — Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Ryan — who are trying to reach a compromise on the 2011 budget and the debt ceiling. It is easy to forget that in January she lost her bid for chairman of the House Republican Conference, the No. 4 leadership spot.                
                

            
                On talk radio and conservative websites, the congresswoman is the star witness against any budget deal. She argues with fury and sparkling eyes that proposed cuts in spending have been too shallow and there is no need to fear a government shutdown. Bachmann is also livid that health care reform is the law of the land, oblivious to the fact that it is increasingly popular with the public and every effort to reverse it can be blocked by the Democratically-controlled Senate.                
                

            
                Will she attempt to derail the next continuing resolution because she deems it to be insufficiently conservative? How about the vote to raise the debt ceiling? How long will the GOP leadership indulge her antics on important votes? Can they really do anything to stop her?                
                

            
                Boehner must be careful how he deals with Bachmann and her supporters. Ohio Tea Party activists have already launched a phone campaign in his home district to complain he is not a true conservative for failing to block a possible debt-limit increase. Judson Phillips, founder of Tea Party Nation, is openly looking for a recruit to run against Boehner in the next primary. “Charlie Sheen is now making more sense than John Boehner,” a mocking Phillips wrote recently.                
                

            
                So as the next election draws closer, Boehner might need Bachmann and her Tea Party credibility as a working member of Congress to mollify those brash, uncompromising forces in the party. And the Speaker could also use her unrivaled stature to push back against Tea Party primary challenges to several vulnerable Republicans who are loyal to him.                
                

            
                If Bachmann plays her cards right and begins to pick her battles more strategically, she could have considerable leverage on the Hill. However, the business of being a serious legislator and political power broker is not always fun. It certainly cannot be as fun as going on television every night, flirting with a run for president and being talked about as the leader of a radical political movement.                
                

            
                But Bachmann is also dancing on the razor’s edge of becoming marginalized as someone who is not serious — a self-serving celebrity, in high school lingo a “Mean Girl.”                
                

            
                That is the same toxic formula that has led to Sarah Palin’s falling poll numbers. Boehner might decide the smart play is to take on Bachmann in an effort to increase his appeal to mainstream Republicans, independents and conservative Democrats.                
                

            
                The “It” girl may just be the one to bring out the tough guy in John Boehner.

Why Obama Is a Lame Duck,"Just seven months into his term -- and 14 months before the 2010 midterm election -- and could it be, is President Obama already a lame duck?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                With his passive management style -- which inevitably led to overreaching and heavy-handedness by Congressional Democrats  Obama has made himself largely irrelevant on many of the issues he ran on, from health care ""reform"" to ""resetting"" our foreign relations. Here are seven signs that Obama's political suasion is waning:                  
                

            
                                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                1. On the heels of Obama's tacit DNR on the end-of-life death panels in the Senate Finance Committee's health care ""reform"" proposal, the administration signaled that it is also willing to bury what has always been a key element of the president's plans for healthcare ""reform""(watch this video) -- a government financed ""public option"" to compete with (and eventually drive out of business) private health insurers. Bowing to opposition from Republicans in both houses of Congress, and fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats in the House, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the administration's fall-back position would be to support creation of consumer-owned nonprofit health insurance cooperatives. But the compromise is anathema to House Dems and Obama's liberal base, who vowed to fight to the bitter end for the public option. Either way, it's a damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't situation for Obama (and we saw Sebelieus backtrack on Tuesday) and demonstrates how completely he has lost control of the health care debate.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                2. After repeatedly insisting on getting a bill on his desk before Congress recessed for the summer, President Obama thought he had a deal with Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) that if the ""Gang of Six"" -- three Democrats and three Republican senators on the Finance Committee -- can't reach a consensus on a bipartisan bill by September 15 then the effort will be scrapped and Dems will push forward with their partisan proposals. But then Gang of Six member Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) told ""FOX News Sunday's"" Chris Wallace that he and the others will not be ""held hostage"" by the mid-September deadline, and that he and his five colleagues ""rejected"" a specific timetable, because ""it's more important to get this right.""In a warning to Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, he added, ""What we have agreed to is that we are going to be ready when we're ready.""                
                

            
                
3. A recipient of $45 billion in taxpayer assistance -- with the government holding a 34 percent ownership interest -- Citibank is required to submit the pay packages for its 25 senior executives and highest-paid employees to Kenneth Feinberg, the Obama administration's special compensation master (AKA ""pay czar"") for review. The New York Times reports that Citi plans to pay two of its traders a combined $128 million under contracts that had been signed before Congress passed a law tasking the Treasury Secretary with examining compensation packages of top executives at companies that received funds from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) -- even after being warned by Treasury officials that the contracts would be rejected:                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Now the bank's decision presents the administration with an awkward political choice between doing little or doing nothing about the contract.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Treasury officials could issue a nonbinding advisory opinion critical of the pay package that that would carry no legal weight but could ameliorate some of the expected political fallout. Or it could do nothing and face the wrath of the public and Congress, which will consider legislation to limit executive pay after its August recess.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Feinberg himself is unsure of whether he has the legal authority to make Citi toe the line. Speaking in generalities, he told Reuters that his authority over executive compensation is ""binding"" and can ""claw back"" money already paid out, but regarding the specific case of the two Citi traders -- one of which stands to earn $98 million this year -- he admitted that he is unsure at this juncture ""[w]hether I have jurisdiction to decide his compensation or not""and that he has ""limited power"" over contracts signed before February 11, 2009.""                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                So if Citi thumbs its nose at Tiny Tim Geithner and Feinberg, there may be little or nothing the Obama administration can do about it.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                4. If enacted, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warns that the House's ""cap-and-trade""climate change bill would cost $8 billion over a 10-year period to implement, and would require thousands of new bureaucrats to formulate nearly 1,500 regulations and mandates for at 21 federal agencies, reports The Washington Times.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Now, four Democratic Senators -- Blanche Lincoln (Ark.), Ben Nelson (Neb.) and Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan (both representing North Dakota)  want to scale down the upper chamber's climate-change bill, reports Bloomberg.com:                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                The resistance by Lincoln and her Senate colleagues undercuts President Barack Obama's effort to win passage of legislation that would cap carbon dioxide emissions and establish a market for trading pollution allowances, said Peter Molinaro, the head of government affairs for Midland, Michigan- based Dow Chemical Co., which supports the measure.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate say they are sticking with their plan to combine a version of that bill with a separate measure mandating energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources such as solar and wind power. The legislation also provides for an extension of offshore oil and gas drilling in certain areas, broadening its support.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Reid needs 60 votes to pass a bill that includes a cap-and-trade measure in the Senate, and 15 Dems have already joined their Repub colleagues in opposition because of concerns on the effects of the legislation on the economy.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                5. Leaving aside Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez's continual disrespect towards Obama ""calling him an ""ignoramus""and saying he is ""lost in the Andromeda Nebula"" -- The Christian Science Monitor notes that ""President Obama may be willing to talk to America's adversaries abroad, but six months into his tenure hardly anyone is returning his call""and that ""[w]hether the issue is key security threats, as with Iran and North Korea, or lower-profile matters, as with Cuba or Burma (Myanmar), Obama's critics and even some backers of the ""talk to the enemy' approach are starting to speak of the policy's limits:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                As Americans went to the polls last year, they were apparently ready to give Obama's approach a try, after the perceived failures of the Bush administration's practice of freezing out enemy states. As president, Obama wasted no time converting a campaign pledge to official policy, declaring in his inaugural address, ""We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.""                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                More than six months later, Obama can claim no breakthroughs or cite any obvious unclenched fists. Of the cases where the policy faces its biggest test -- Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba -- responses to Obama's outstretched hand range from a bite back on the nuclear front (North Korea) to silence (Iran) to modest movement (Syria and Cuba).                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                [C]ritics say the months since the extended hand of the inauguration have allowed adversaries time to further their own goals.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                6. Here at home, Obama's grass-roots network -- the 13 million member-strong Organizing for America -- is not exactly champing at the bit to have a go at opponents of his health care objectives, reports The New York Times:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                More than a dozen campaign volunteers, precinct captains and team leaders from all corners of Iowa, who dedicated a large share of their time in 2007 and 2008 to Mr. Obama, said ...""they supported the president completely but were taking a break from politics and were not active members of Organizing for America.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Some said they were reluctant to talk to their neighbors about something personal and complicated like health care. ...                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                But even among those who turned out for the meetings, many of whom had Obama buttons affixed to their shirts and spoke glowingly of the president, there was a sense of fatigue at the prospect of returning to the political calisthenics the Obama army once required.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                To Jim Pinkerton, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and a FOX News contributor, the lack of enthusiasm is quite illuminating -- ""a tale of not only political enervation, but also an epic tale of policy defeat."" In a post published on the Serious Medicine Strategy blog, Pinkerton writes:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                ""Taking a break from politics""? Excuse me, but that's not how political activists operate. They get into politics because they like a campaign, or, if one prefers, a crusade. And they get out when they don't have such an energizing effort to throw themselves into -- or when their eager hearts are broken. And yet that's what Obama has given Democratic activists -- a heartbreaking, de-energizing argument. ...                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                But of course, we are out of money for health care because Obama chose to spend that money on other priorities -- Tim Geithner's friends. ... Given a choice between investment bankers and non-masters-of-the-universe, Obama and his investment-banker-ish advisers chose ... investment bankers. Maybe Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan can make those grassrootsy phone calls in Iowa.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                What Americans get all fired up about, Pinkerton rightly observes, is fighting for their own health, not for ""health insurance reform.""                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                7. A new Gallup Poll, ""Political Ideology By State, January 2 -- June 30, 2009,"" finds that ""a significantly higher percentage of Americans in most states -- even some solidly Democratic ones -- call themselves conservative rather than liberal. Here's the breakdown: In all 50 states, more people call themselves ""conservative"" than ""liberal;""in 22 states, more people call themselves ""conservative"" than ""moderate; and in 10 states, the number of people who call themselves ""conservative""and ""moderate"" are tied or virtually tied. And remember, this poll was taken before the healthcare ""reform""issue ignited and moderates and independents started attending town hall meetings demanding to know how the government will pay for a massive, costly new entitlement.

On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said people have lost confidence in government:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                You know, this debate isn't about health care.  Health care's the symptom.  The debate is an uncontrolled federal government. ... [T]he tone is based on fear of loss of control of their own government. ... [W]e have raised the question of whether or not we're legitimately thinking about the American people and their long-term best interests.                  
                

            
                                 
                

            
                The Democrats control both houses of Congress and, as president, Obama is the head of the party so a loss in confidence in the government is, at least in part, a loss in confidence in his leadership of the government.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Columnist Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, marvels, ""[w]e are witnessing one of the more rapid turnabouts in recent American political history:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                President Obama's popularity has plummeted to 50 percent and lower in some polls, while the public expresses even less confidence in the Democratic-led Congress and the direction of the country at large. Yet, just eight months ago, liberals were talking in Rovian style about a new generation to come of progressive politics - and the end of both the Republican party and the legacy of Reaganism itself. Barack Obama was to be the new FDR and his radical agenda an even better New Deal.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Hanson attributes Obama's puffed-up popularity falling like a souffle  to 10 factors -- including voters being wary that the cures for global warming, illegal immigration, health care and other large, seemingly intractable problems are worse than the problems themselves --especially new direct and indirect taxes taking an even bigger bite out of the family budget; becoming outraged over the quadrupling of the national debt; finding Obama to be extremely partisan, polarizing and ""hyper-racially conscious"" and apprehension that Obamania is verging on something sinister and Orwellian.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                All of which may be setting Dems up for a comeuppance in November 2010. Byron York, chief political correspondent of The Washington Examiner, writes: ""It's a possibility many Republicans speak of only in whispers and Democrats are just now beginning to face. After passionate and contentious fights over health care, the environment, and taxes, could Democrats lose big -- really big -- in next year's elections? ... Not long ago, some Republicans were worried about becoming a permanent minority party. Although they may not win in 2010, they feel like they're back in the game.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                In either case, the 2010 election could put checks and balances on Pelosi and Obama -- which will make it even harder than it has proven thus far for the president to keep his campaign promises. And when he runs for re-election in 2012, disappointed, disillustioned and dispirited libs and young voters may not report for duty at Organizing for America, or flock to the polls as they did in 2008.

"For the Health of the Country, Let's Use Commonsense to Reduce Medicare Spending","The increasingly adversarial debt negotiations on Capitol Hill have both parties anxious to settle the budget debate.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Republicans want to seriously cut entitlement spending, while Democrats are looking to raise government revenue through eliminating tax loopholes and certain deductions and increasing some taxes.                
                

            
                As the debate continues there are several ways for lawmakers to reduce Medicare spending in a commonsense, bipartisan manner.                
                

            
                For example, the eligibility age for Medicare should be 67 -- not 65. Making this change would save $124 billion.                 
                

            
                Lawmakers should also cut back subsidies for beneficiaries to buy supplemental “Medigap” insurance. This could save $92 billion by 2021.                 
                

            
                Increase premiums that beneficiaries pay for Medicare doctors’ coverage so they cover 35 percent of the program’s costs -- instead of today's 25 percent -- would save $241 billion.                 
                

            
                Finally, lawmakers should modernize Medicare’s benefits package, including the copayment structure. With a deductible and out-of-pocket maximum that is indexed to increases in spending per beneficiary, the government would save about $14 billion through 2018.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, lawmakers in both parties seem most eager to pursue hyper-partisan policies that could end up backfiring -- both raising costs and hurting seniors. One suggestion that some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for is to impose mandatory rebates on many of the drugs sold in Medicare Part D. Republicans are reportedly considering signing onto this plan. It's a bad idea.                
                

            
                Reforming Medicare is a crucial component of federal fiscal reform. But forcing rebates in Part D will wind up distorting the health marketplace and hurting patients. Both parties must come together to create Medicare policies that are truly innovative, bipartisan, and sensitive to beneficiary needs.                
                

            
                Medicare Part D is unique in that it employs both market competition and government oversight. Private insurers administer the drug plans and are responsible for negotiating with pharmacies and drug companies when crafting benefits. Part D enrollees may pick among the various drug plans offered, comparing and contrasting price and quality for each. The government sets fair rules of play and provides financial assistance to beneficiaries.                
                

            
                This model yields huge savings and keeps healthcare costs under control. The Congressional Budget Office's current estimate for Part D's total costs between 2004 and 2013 is 46 percent lower than the initial projections.                
                

            
                Patients have also seen low costs since the program's inception. The monthly premium for the average Part D enrollee is $30 this year. That's well below the original estimate of $53 per month. And low costs haven't put a damper on patient's drug coverage options. The Lewin Group finds that the most popular Part D plan covers 99 percent of the most popular pharmaceuticals.                
                

            
                Despite this success, some lawmakers hope rebates will extract additional savings from Part D.                
                

            
                This plan would be modeled on Medicaid's drug benefit, which is administered jointly by states and the federal government and covers America's neediest citizens.                
                

            
                In each state, the Medicaid program receive rebates from drug manufacturers for drugs dispensed to enrollees. For brand-name pharmaceuticals, the typical rebate is either about a quarter of the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for the drug, or it's the difference between the AMP and the lowest price offer to private purchasers. The rebate is always the highest of the two figures.                
                

            
                Some lawmakers propose instituting this same rebate system to Part D. But this will increase seniors' premiums and stifle innovation. The CBO has estimated that imposing Medicare-style rebates could cause enrollee premiums to jump by as much as 20 percent. It has also found that mandatory rebates in Part D ""would reduce manufacturers’ incentives to invest in R&D.""                
                

            
                This isn't the only potential change to Medicare that could hurt America's seniors. Another is the establishment of an unelected panel created under last year's healthcare reform law called the ""Independent Payment Advisory Board,"" which will recommend cuts to Medicare spending.                
                

            
                This cost-cutting board has strong support from the Obama administration and some lawmakers on Capitol Hill. But fortunately, members of both parties -- including Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Allyson Schwartz of Pennsylvania -- are beginning to speak loudly in support of repeal, fearing that IPAB could result in to arbitrary cuts to doctors and other healthcare providers.                
                

            
                The budget debate need to be grounded in smart policies. This isn't the time for artificial partisan boundaries. Lawmakers must come together and put this country back on a sustainable fiscal course.                 
                

            
                Medicare reform is a large part of that effort, but meddling with a successful program is the wrong way to do it. Instituting bipartisan, sound reforms makes much more sense.

Increased access to affordable health care begins with end of ObamaCare subsidies,"(AP Photo/Don Ryan)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The King v. Burwell decision will arrive soon. The future of ObamaCare hangs in the balance. There are days when the court decision appears to be a subject of intrigue and other days when it is a subject of dread. President Obama seems to have no Plan B while the Republican-led Congress continues to bring forward ideas. It is fair to say that the Democrats and this administration have made a mess of health insurance and health care delivery.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The defenders of ObamaCare are touting a reduction in the uninsured rate as a marker for success. Unfortunately, that is all ObamaCare has accomplished – increased numbers of people with insurance cards. As we have consistently said, this is a poor surrogate for actual access to health care. Health insurance and delivery of health care are two separate activities.                
                

            
                We continue to hear from our constituents about high co-pays, high deductibles, and skyrocketing insurance premiums under this program. Constituents say enormous out of pocket expenses present a barrier to health care. If you can’t afford your co-pay, deductible, or premium your insurance card is worthless.                
                

            
                I was recently stopped in the grocery store by a single mom with 3 children and she told me her policy was simply too expensive to use. She felt she was the victim of false hopes.                
                

            
                The Supreme Court decision in King v Burwell will provide us with the opportunity to undo the damage of the past 5 years and reset the health care button. The court will set the date for the subsidies to end. At that point, they must end and must not be renewed.                
                

            
                There is a conservative way forward which will incorporate two overarching, strategic ideas. We begin with the end in mind – access to affordable health care for all Americans.                
                

            
                First, with increased access to affordable health care for all Americans as our mantra, we will reform the health care system. It is crucial to understand that actual access to affordable health care is different than eligibility for an overly prescriptive, Washington-driven, health insurance policy.                
                

            
                Secondly, once the Supreme Court determines the ObamaCare subsidies to be illegal, they must stop. They represent the most disingenuous part of law – they are a broken promise to Americans looking for affordable health care.                
                

            
                Once again, if you can’t afford your co-pay, deductible, or insurance premium, your subsidy and insurance cards are worthless.                
                

            
                Further, these subsidies are an irresponsible, wishful thinking, use of taxpayer dollars. The American people expect us to end them at the very moment the Court deems them to end. At that point, ObamaCare will cease to exist.                
                

            
                Next we move to the tactics of implementing our strategy to increase access to affordable health care for all Americans. We do not want anyone to be left in the lurch due to having been a part of the ill-conceived exchanges.                
                

            
                Reaching our goal will require significant changes in our ways of thinking about the infrastructure and use of health care. The fatal flaw of ObamaCare is that it simply built a system on what was already crumbling.                
                

            
                To achieve transformation, all voices must be heard – patients, doctors, payors, hospitals, and others. Transformation will never be accomplished behind closed doors in Washington. Washington should create the environment and transformation will be accomplished in health care innovation centers around the country.                
                

            
                Legislative changes will need to be made. These will be done in a systematic, thoughtful, and deliberative manner and meet the date the court sets to end the subsidies. Some changes will not be easy, but they will be necessary. Choices made will be done in a pragmatic manner.                
                

            
                We’ve discussed an overarching strategy of increasing access to affordable health care for all Americans. We’ve also discussed the deliberative process by which we will accomplish the tactical implementation of true healthcare reform.                
                

            
                Finally, we will focus on specific ideas to implement. Many of these ideas are already included in GOP sponsored legislation – they are on the shelf, ready to go. For the past several years, these ideas have been the subject of hearings, discussions, task force efforts and have been found worthy of consideration.
 
 Patient-focused reforms will include protection from old practices which allowed insurance companies to refuse to insure because of pre-existing conditions. Lifetime limits on health care would no longer be allowed, nor would rescissions of coverage. All efforts would be made with the idea of making health care affordable for the individual and providing bankruptcy protection which was problematic in the past.
 
 Small businesses and individuals will be empowered by having the ability to choose from a wide variety of insurance products such as health savings accounts. This is in stark contrast to Obamacare which is a mandated, one size fits all idea.                
                

            
                A standard tax deduction for health insurance will make the tax code fairer for those who work for small companies or who are self employed. Currently, many of those individuals are purchasing insurance with post-tax dollars. All would benefit from the tax advantage that employees of large companies enjoy.                
                

            
                A more competitive insurance market will be encouraged by allowing the purchase of health insurance across state lines as well as the enforcement of antitrust measures with insurance companies.                
                

            
                States will be empowered to provide coverage for their most vulnerable citizens by increasing the roll of State high risk pools and modernizing Medicaid.                
                

            
                And costs in health care will be addressed. Discouraging overutilization of services, misutilization of the emergency room and decreasing the need for defensive medicine will all help with costs.                
                

            
                Finally, in this process it is helpful to remember the wise words of Lao Tzu, “The journey of 1,000 miles begins with one step.”                
                

            
                In the case of achieving meaningful increased access to healthcare, it begins with the end of the ObamaCare subsidies.

A Significant Victory In the Fight Against Obamacare,"Americans who own and run their own small businesses understand better than anyone the importance of limited government for prosperity and liberty. So, when Congressional Democrats and the Obama administration decided that they had the power to force every American citizen to buy health insurance – the first time the federal government has ever tried to force Americans to buy anything – the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) moved quickly to oppose this unprecedented and profoundly unconstitutional claim of power.

By joining with 20 state governments in a lawsuit aimed at overturning the controversial new health care law, NFIB is making sure that small business stands up for the Founding Fathers' vision of a federal government of limited powers. At the core of the case, currently before federal Judge Roger Vinson in Pensacola, Florida, is the Constitution’s “Commerce Clause” which authorizes Congress to “regulate” interstate commerce. As NFIB and the states challenging the law argue, not once in the Constitution's 223-year history has the Commerce Clause been interpreted to allow Congress to force citizens to engage in economic activity, rather than simply to allow it to regulate those who choose to do so.

This is a vital distinction. If the Commerce Clause allows Congress to force Americans to buy health insurance (or anything else), there will cease to be any constitutional barrier to Congress’ mandating all sorts of other purchases. It is not too difficult to imagine federal ""mandates"" to buy fruits and vegetables or join a gym, or even to buy cars from manufacturers bailed out by the federal government.

Judge Vinson seems to agree. Today, he ruled that NFIB’s lawsuit may move forward and denied the Obama administration’s request that he dismiss the case. In doing so, Judge Vinson stated (pages 63-64):                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                “The individual mandate applies across the board. People have no choice and there is no way to avoid it. Those who fall under the individual mandate either comply with it, or they are penalized. It is not based on an activity that they make the choice to undertake. Rather, it is based solely on citizenship and on being alive. As the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office concluded sixteen years ago (when the individual mandate was considered, but not pursued during the 1994 national healthcare reform efforts): “A mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance would be an unprecedented form of federal action. The government has never required people to buy any good or service as a condition of lawful residence in the United States.” See Congressional Budget Office Memorandum, The Budgetary Treatment of an Individual Mandate to Buy Health Insurance, August 1994                
                

            
                The lawsuit is far from over, but today’s ruling represents a significant victory: NFIB will now be able to fully argue its case and the administration will have to defend its attempt to exert unprecedented and unconstitutional power over the lives of individuals. NFIB is confident that the Constitution will prevail.

8 Truths -- and the Consequences -- In Obama's First Year,"It has been almost a year since President Obama was sworn in as our nation’s fourty-fourth president.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The hype over the “Obama brand” and the promise for “change” was deafening from Obama supporters and much of the media leading up to and after the inauguration.                
                

            
                Now, after a year in office it is fair to take a look back at the president’s record and match truth to consequence.                
                

            
                Here is a list of key issues for the Obama administration:                
                

            
                The Closing of Gitmo                
                

            
                Truth: One of Obama’s first acts as president was to sign an Executive Order on January 22, 2009 ordering the closing of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Prison as a U.S. detention
facility. In his remarks on that day, the president promised that Guantanamo would be closed within his first year in office.                
                

            
                Consequence: Guantanamo is still open and the administration has found it difficult to come up with a viable alternative to the facility or what to do with the detainees they now seek to detain or release.                
                

            
                The Economy                
                

            
                Truth: The president’s first major piece of legislation was the now infamous $787 billion dollar “Stimulus” bill passed by the Senate in February 2009. This was the bill that admittedly most legislators did not read before voting on it – the one with no transparency. Passage of the bill was demanded by the president, who said that time was of the essence to save jobs. The president promised that the bill would prevent the nation’s unemployment rate from rising above eight percent.                
                

            
                Consequence: Most of the stimulus money remains unspent. Unemployment has topped 10% nationally since the stimulus bill was passed and in many urban areas tops 16% and is rising.                
                

            
                Foreign Policy:                
                

            
                Truth: The president promised that with his unique persona and his “new style” of governing that he could unilaterally convince all those who don’t like us, to like us. He convinced his believers that all he needed to do is “change the tone” and dictators in countries like Iran and North Korea would abandon their nuclear weapons programs and that terrorists would stand down. The president promised a new era of global cooperation on “global warming” and predicted he could bring historic global agreement.                
                

            
                Consequence: The world is a much more dangerous place since Obama took office. Iran has escalated their nuclear weapons program and North Korea has not abandoned theirs. No headway has been made in the Middle East peace process. Talks broke down on “global warming” in Copenhagen in December and no concrete agreement was delivered as promised by the president. As a consequence no progress was made domestically on passage of cap-and-trade legislation.                
                

            
                War on Terror:                
                

            
                Truth: Immediately after taking office and in the months following the inauguration the Obama administration actively made a point of removing the words “terrorism” and the “War on Terror” from their public speech. Instead they choose to call acts of terrorism – “man-caused disasters.” The president went on what I can only describe as an “apology tour” which he kicked with the first sit-down interview of his presidency on Al Arabia television in which he pandered and apologized for past American aggressiveness.                
                

            
                Consequence: The foiled Christmas Day terrorist attack on a Northwest Airlines flight over Michigan forced the president, albeit several days later, to acknowledge the obvious -- there is indeed a “War on Terror.” And it does not matter who our president is -- radical Islamists seek to destroy America, today, tomorrow, next year or even a decade from now.                
                

            
                Transparency:                
                

            
                Truth: President Obama promised that a hallmark of his administration would be transparency. This is some of what he promised:
“We’ll have [healthcare reform] negotiations televised on C-SPAN, so the people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their constituents and who is making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies.”                
                

            
                Consequence: To date there have been NO televised negotiations on health care, the “stimulus bill,” cap-and-trade or any other major piece of legislation being advanced by the Obama administration and the Democratically-controlled Congress.                
                

            
                Immigration:                
                

            
                Truth: President Obama promised to make immigration reform a top priority in his first year.
Consequence: President Obama has done nothing on immigration reform in his first year, other than traveling in August to Mexico where he announced he will take no action on comprehensive immigration reform until 2010.                
                

            
                Health Care:                
                

            
                Truth: President Obama demanded health care be passed before the August 2009 Congressional recess and said that he would not sign a health care reform bill without a “public option.”                
                

            
                Consequence: Health care legislation was NOT passed in August and it still has not been passed. It is clear that the public does not want a “public option” and now the president has abandoned that requirement. Democrats -- NOT Republicans -- have been the one and only reason that a health care bill has not passed and thus not signed by their party’s president.                
                

            
                Our National Debt:                
                

            
                Truth: During the 2008 campaign then-candidate Obama was highly critical of the national debt. He vowed to “take a scalpel” to the national budget and to make it a top priority to reduce the nation’s debt.                
                

            
                Consequence: The president has already quadrupled the nation’s deficit thanks to his failed “stimulus bill.” This year the deficit has increased by almost $1.8 trillion dollars and is likely to increase by a trillion dollars a year for the next ten years.                
                

            
                A year ago many believed that Barack Obama was the only politician able to solve the problem facing America. They believed he had all the answers and were mesmerized by his powerful oratory and presence. They believed that all he had to do was address an issue and it would be settled. Supporters saw him as a leader with extraordinary powers and they spoke of him in awe and hushed tones.                
                

            
                The reality is that the president is not all that. He is a person who is not into “heavy lifting.” For my money, he never was. It’s my belief that he ran for a state senate post in Illinois so that he could run for a seat in the U.S. Senate. He ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate and then within 2 years of being elected to that post ran for president! He hasn’t spent much time governing although, no one can argue, he is one hell of a campaigner.                
                

            
                The problem now is that Obama -- the candidate -- has reached the end of the political line. He, and the advisers who surround him, never grasped the fact that the campaign was over, that the time to govern has arrived. Instead of taking the reigns of power, he ceded his power and authority to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. What we got out of this deal was a disastrous “stimulus bill” that was rammed through the Congress and a manufactured “crisis” on health care that has paralyzed our government for the past 10 months.                
                

            
                In short, the reality is that our president is just a mere mortal. He has been seriously overrated in terms of both his competence and ability.                
                

            
                He has not delivered on the “change” he promised -- not because he doesn’t want to, but because he doesn’t know how too.                
                

            
                Reluctantly, many Americans have finally gotten wise to the fact that politically, their president, just like the emperor in the the fairy tale, has no clothes.

                Reading the health care reform press coverage today and over the weekend must have been very frustrating for Democrats and encouraging for Republicans. Despite pulling out all the stops, including a rushed-looking presidential statement in the Rose Garden late Friday afternoon, America just isn't buying it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Sometimes presidents have to stick to their principles and lead by making decisions that might not be popular, but I don't think that this version of health care reform fits such a scenario. ""We need a win"" is not a principle, and the Democrats would have been better off if they'd not let that narrative gain the substantial ground it now enjoys.                
                

            
                President Obama holds considerable good will with a majority of Americans, though as they learn more about the policy details they are resisting most of his suggested changes. It strikes me that he should consider asking the State Department to make him a new button -- one that would allow him to hit pause. Then he could regroup and encourage a bipartisan healthcare reform bill that could perhaps go somewhere besides the potential for it to go down in flames.                
                

            
                I know this wouldn't be popular with a lot of people, but it could prevent further erosion of support for the general consensus from both parties that the status quo is unacceptable.                
                

            
                
To me, it's like they're trying to pound a square peg into a round hole. It will not fit. And if you force the peg through, everything around it will break -- making other important issues harder to fix.                
                

            
                My advice is to stop pounding...we're all getting headaches. Pull back and either square the circle or circle the square before trying again.

The Only Way to Grow Our Economy Is to Grow Small Businesses,"This week marks the 48th annual National Small Business Week, a recognized time to celebrate the contributions of small businesses to the economic well-being of America. Republican Members of the House Small Business Committee will celebrate American small firms by holding forums and listening sessions in Congressional districts across America this week.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Small businesses create seven of every ten new jobs and employ over half of the country’s private sector work force. They are the key to solving our nation’s unemployment problem; and if we want to get our economy back on track, we must find ways to spur small business growth.                
                

            
                The economic downturn of the last few years has taken quite a toll on American entrepreneurs. Despite their hard work and determination, many small business owners struggled to make payroll and many were forced to close their doors for good. One of the most significant obstacles faced by our small companies during this tumultuous period has been access to capital.                
                

            
                Capital is critical for small business success. Small firms lack the resources of their larger counterparts and rely on financing to carry out their daily operations. Without it, they would be unable to replenish inventory or purchase new equipment and many would simply cease to exist. Small businesses need diverse ways to access capital to start their business, invest in their company, and meet unexpected challenges, and it’s important for banks to work closer with their small business customers to make sure they have the capital they need to accomplish these goals.                
                

            
                While the Obama administration claims that lending standards to small firms have loosened, the fiscal crisis and a stricter regulatory environment have left banks wary of lending to small businesses. Additionally, uncertainty over the direction of the economy, healthcare reform, taxes and regulations make small businesses more vulnerable as the compliance burden posed by complex rules and mandates grows.                
                

            
                A monumental piece of legislation that is impacting access to capital is the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,” which became law in July of 2010. The bill was designed to address the financial meltdown but it is creating many unintended negative consequences.                
                

            
                In order to help small businesses gain access to the credit and capital they need to run their business successfully, Congress must adopt policies that support functional capital markets without imposing undue restrictions on providers of debt and equity capital. Additionally, Congress must remove barriers that prevent participation in and utilization of the SBA financing programs.                
                

            
                Congress can protect small businesses by providing effective oversight over SBA policies and make sure they take into account the needs of small businesses while also protecting taxpayer dollars. Congress also needs to make sure that new banking regulations do not make it more costly for community banks to lend to small businesses.                
                

            
                As Chairman of the Small Business Committee, I intend to delve into the state of the economic environment for both banks and small businesses and the federal regulatory pressure on both entities.                 
                

            
                In early June, my Committee will be holding a hearing on the issue of access to capital and we will explore innovative ways that banks are reaching out to small businesses and how the government can help create a better atmosphere for those financial relationships.                 
                

            
                In addition, our Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access Chairman Joe Walsh (R-Ill.) will hold a hearing on the impact of Dodd-Frank this summer.                
                

            
                The precarious state of our economy, combined with unnecessary overregulation by the Obama administration, has restricted small business access to capital.                 
                

            
                I have heard firsthand from several small business owners about their struggle to borrow and their fear of taking on additional debt. Government should stand aside and let the business community prosper, instead of imposing new regulations that will only stifle growth and limit access to capital. I am hopeful that the Senate and the president will join with the House and work to help more Americans start and grow their small businesses.

"Romney, Gingrich, Huntsman and Health Care Hypocrisy","What do Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, have in common?
Long before President Obama even entered the Oval Office, both men supported an idea they now pretend to spurn — the idea of requiring people to buy health insurance.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As recently as 2009, Romney publicly supported, the “individual mandate” for buying health insurance. And as recently as last month one of Gingrich’s websites still endorsed the “mandate” for all Americans earning more than $50,000 annually.                
                

            
                Romney and Gingrich are not alone in their history of supporting the idea of a government requirement that everyone buy health insurance. As governor of Utah in 2007, Jon Huntsman endorsed a health care reform plan from the United Way of Salt Lake City that called for a mandate.                
                

            
                “I think if you’re going to get it done and get it done right, the mandate has to be part of it in some way, shape or form,” he said at the time.                
                

            
                Gingrich, Romney and Huntsman are wide open to charges of political hypocrisy.                
                

            
                They apparently feel the need to fake their outrage over the individual mandate to win the GOP nomination. In an age of outrageous political posturing — telling lies and daring anyone to call you on it — this is the strongest indicator of the current lack of leadership and honest political debate about major national problems.                
                

            
                And it is not even good politics.                
                

            
                A CNN poll taken in November found that support for the individual mandate rose to its highest level yet, with 52 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed. The previous poll taken in June found that 54 percent opposed it and 44 percent supported it. That shift to support for the individual mandate is likely to grow as more parts of the overall Affordable Healthcare Act go into effect over the next two years.                
                

            
                At the moment, polling results on the overall national health care reform plan range from support between 38 percent and 40 percent and opposition between 44 percent and 48 percent (Quinnipiac and Kaiser Family polling). That split is pretty good for a plan filled with so many unknowns.                
                

            
                But as the GOP contenders face waves of strong conservative voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, united principally by a distaste for Obama, those candidates have concluded it is wise to pretend to have no connection with Obama’s signature legislation. Tea Party anger at the Democrats’ health care reform plan did drive the success of Republican candidates who won big in the 2010 midterm elections.                
                

            
                But times change.                
                

            
                Now national polls show support for the Tea Party is lower than support for Occupy Wall Street, and falling fast. And already Americans express support for key elements of the health care reform legislation that have been implemented, including allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans until they are twenty six.                
                

            
                Similarly, support is high for requiring insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing medical conditions as well as closing the so-called “doughnut hole” in subsidies that help seniors pay for prescription drugs.                
                

            
                The general election campaign is going to be even more distant from angry Tea Party activists. By the 2012 general election, the eventual GOP nominee is going to be open to charges of flip-flopping on healthcare reform. He will also find himself out of step with the American people who know the status quo on healthcare is expensive and leaves them vulnerable to the profit-driven prerogatives of insurance companies.                
                

            
                Romney, Gingrich and Huntsman have to realize they are playing a losing game in terms of general election politics.                
                

            
                At the CNN debate this October in Las Vegas, Gingrich took a swipe at Romney over the former Massachusetts governor’s healthcare plan that requires citizens in the Bay State to buy health insurance. Romney shot back: “Newt, we got the idea of individual mandate from you.”                
                

            
                Gingrich responded: “You did not get that from me. You got that from the Heritage Foundation.”                
                

            
                They are both correct on this revealing point. The Heritage Foundation, the influential conservative think tank, first developed the idea of an individual mandate for healthcare in the late 1980s. That is how deeply this idea is tied to conservative thinkers.                
                

            
                Romney used the Heritage policy in developing his Massachusetts health care law. That reform contained the dreaded individual mandate.                
                

            
                And Gingrich supported the federal mandate as an alternative to Hillary Clinton’s health care reform package when he was Speaker in the 1990s.                
                

            
                If Republican voters heard Gingrich and Romney speak honestly about health care reform — and why they came to appreciate and support the good of the individual mandate — my bet is that most GOP and independent voters would be more impressed than they are with the blatant lies now being told on the campaign trail.

"Why the battle over health care, immigration and education won't be in Washington in 2012","The January forecast for Congress calls for a continued deep freeze.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                That means the most important public policy debates facing the nation will remain locked under the icy divide between the Democratic majority in the Senate and the Republican majority in the House. This forecast has held true since the start of the 112th Congress last January.                
                

            
                The frigid environment led the president last week to make a controversial recess appointment for the head of a new consumer watchdog agency. Senate Republicans, true to the freeze, claim the Senate is not in recess so as to block the appointment. The president, playing on the historic high level of public discontent with congressional inaction, said he refused to “stand by while a minority in the Senate puts party ideology ahead of the people they were elected to serve.”                
                

            
                Last year the freeze on Capitol Hill brought us a paltry two-month extension of the payroll tax cut. It also led to the failure of the supercommittee, the burying of the deficit reduction plan proposed by former Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and three-near government shutdowns. The cold inside the Capitol spread to Wall Street and led to the downgrade of the nation’s credit rating.                
                

            
                And now there is the added chill that arrives with an election year. The GOP has no incentive to give the president any legislative victories. At best, Republicans in the House and Democrats in the Senate will try to force their opposition into casting unpopular votes on big issues. The goal is not to pass any meaningful legislation but to score political points and create fodder for political attack ads.                
                

            
                The bottom line for the coming year is that action on issues affecting the lives of real Americans will come from state governments and federal courts. Here are three major policy fights that will take place on battlegrounds far from Capitol Hill.                
                

            
                Immigration: GOP governors and state legislatures are pressing tough new immigration laws modeled after Arizona’s S.B. 1070. States such as South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia have enacted similar “Papers Please” laws. A federal judge blocked Arizona’s law in 2010 and last month, another federal court blocked parts of the South Carolina law as unconstitutional infringement on federal law. The GOP proponents of the state laws argue they are necessary due to Congress’ failure to act on immigration reform. The Supreme Court has announced it will rule on Arizona’s appeal sometime this year.                
                

            
                Health Care: In the absence of federal reform, Medicaid will continue its downward spiral into insolvency. This means that cash-strapped states will have to make painful cuts and enact cost-saving measures like means-testing to make up the difference. Also, the Supreme Court has said it will rule on the individual mandate in President Obama’s healthcare reform law. Several Republican governors argue it is unconstitutional and will burden businesses in their states.                 
                

            
                Last November, 66 percent of voters in Ohio voted for a ballot initiative which declared their state to be exempt from a national healthcare mandate – directly contradicting a central piece of the Affordable Healthcare Act – and setting up a fight between the state government and a paralyzed federal government.                
                

            
                Education: Congress has failed to pass much-needed revisions to No Child Left Behind for the past three years and it is highly unlikely they will do so in 2012. States are using up their stopgap funding for education that was included in the stimulus bill. And the Race to the Top grant program where states compete for additional funding faces serious cuts.                 
                

            
                The only hope for education reform would appear to be on the state level. GOP governors are following the lead of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a passionate reform advocate. However, Christie was unable to get his ambitious reform package through his Democratic-controlled state legislature in 2011. Christie says he will renew his push for merit pay, tenure reform and expansion of charter schools and vouchers in 2012.                
                

            
                And the list of major public policy disputes also includes the controversy over state laws requiring photo identification for voters. The Department of Justice has challenged several of these laws, setting the stage for another battle in federal court. South Carolina’s new voter ID law was recently blocked by the DOJ under the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.) has said she is prepared to challenge the Obama administration all the way to the Supreme Court on this one.                
                

            
                Presidential and congressional candidates will be reacting to whatever legislative action comes from the states. Note that each of these issues tests the limits of federalism itself. This bedrock principle of the U.S. Constitution, codified by the Tenth Amendment, says that there is a separation of powers between the state and federal government. But what happens when the federal government is not doing its job?                
                

            
                Voters can expect both Republicans and Democrats to run against the do-nothing Congress.                
                

            
                Because of Congress’s partisan paralysis, 2012 may signal a monumental shift in power away from the federal government to the state governments – and in the process permanently alter the constitutional interpretation of federalism.

                CHAPTER 1 -- I SAID WHAT I MEANT                
                

            
                I AM A BIGOT. I hate Muslims. I am a fomenter of hate and intolerance. I am a black guy who makes fun of Muslims for the entertainment of white racists. I am brazen enough to do it on TV before the largest cable news audience in America. And I am such a fraud that while I was spreading hate to a conservative audience at night I delivered a totally different message to a large liberal morning-radio audience. I fooled the radio folks into thinking of me as a veteran Washington correspondent and the author of several acclaimed books celebrating America’s battles against racism.                 
                

            
                My animus toward Muslims may be connected to my desire for publicity and the fact that I am mentally unstable. And I am also a fundamentally bad person. I repeatedly ignored warnings to stop violating my company’s standards for news analysis. And I did this after repeated warnings from my patient employer. Therefore, my former employers made the right decision when they fired me. In fact, they should be praised for doing it, and rewarded with taxpayer money. Their only sin was that they didn’t fire me sooner.                
                

            
                This is just a sampling of some of the reaction to National Public Radio’s decision to fire me last year after a ten-year career as a national talk show host, senior correspondent, and senior news analyst. They were not taken from the anonymous comments section of a YouTube page or the reams of hate mail that flooded my in-box in the days before the firing. No, this is the response from the NPR management whom I had served with great success for nearly a decade. It is also the reaction from national advocacy groups like the Council for American Islamic Relations (CAIR), whose work I had generally admired and occasionally defended over the years. Joining them was a small, knee-jerk mob of liberal commentators, including a New York Times editorial writer, who defended NPR as an important news source deserving federal funding even if it meant defaming me—“he made foolish and hurtful remarks about Muslims.” Cable TV star Rachel Maddow, a fervent champion of free speech, agreed that I had a right to say what was on my mind, but in her opinion the comments amounted to bigotry. I had a right to speak but no right to “keep [my] job.” NPR also found support among leftist intellectuals who regularly brag about defending the rights of the little guy but had no problem siding with a big institution over an individual journalist when the journalist was me. One writer said I had long ingratiated myself with conservatives and I had gotten what was coming to me. His conclusion about me: “Sleep with dogs, get fleas.”                 
                

            
                What did I do that warranted the firing and the ad hominem attacks that preceded and followed?                 
                

            
                I simply told the truth.                 
                

            
                Looking back on the torrential media coverage surrounding my dismissal, I am struck by how little of it tells the full story of what actually happened. Basic facts were distorted, important context was not provided, and personal attacks were treated as truth. The lack of honest reporting about the firing and the events that led up to it was not just unfair—most of it was flat-out lies.                 
                

            
                In this first chapter, I will tell you the full story of what happened to me. My purpose in doing this is not to get people to feel sorry for me. The goal of this book is to set the record straight and to use my experience in what amounts to a political and media whacking as the starting point for a much needed discussion about the current, sad state of political discourse in this country. It is time to end the ongoing assault against honest debate in America.                
                

            
                CHAPTER 8 -- THE PROVOCATEURS IN THE MOVIE                 
                

            
                ""The American President,"" actor Michael Douglas plays a president who walks into the White House briefing room and delivers a powerful response to a political opponent’s personal attacks on his character.                 
                

            
                “We have serious problems to solve, and we need serious people to solve them,” he begins. “And whatever your particular problem is, I promise you Bob [his opponent] is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: making you afraid of it, and telling you who’s to blame for it . . . [so he can] win elections.”                 
                

            
                In the final line of the speech, he calls out Bob: “This is a time for serious people, Bob, and your fifteen minutes are up. My name is Andrew Shepherd and I am the president!”                 
                

            
                Like all good works of fiction, that scene is so memorable because it touches on something so real.                 
                

            
                Today’s provocateurs in politics and the media see d conflict everywhere. But nowhere do they show a genuine interest in bringing Americans together to achieve positive results. If they did, they might be out of a job, after all. We are no longer living in the 24-7 news cycle. This new era is being called the “1,440-7” news cycle, where media are competing for the audience’s attention every minute of every day. And one surefire way to get attention in the 1,440-7 news world is to say something outrageous. As a result, we have an entire graduate class of professional provocateurs. We all know them. They are my friends, my colleagues, and occasionally my adversaries in the media. Rush Limbaugh. Rachel Maddow. Sean Hannity . Lawrence O’Donnell. Glenn Beck. Even my colleague and antispinmeister Bill O’Reilly has been accused of the role, although I find his show balanced in a way few talk shows on the Left or Right can match.                 
                

            
                As is true of the medium, talk-show hosts are entertainers as much as they are commentators, and being bland as toast wins neither reviews nor ratings. Whether on the Left or the Right, whether on MSNBC or Fox News, each is aware of their target audience. Each offers provocative commentary that grabs our attention and fires up debate.                 
                

            
                The problem is that talk-show hosts aren’t on the air to compromise or bring opposing sides together; they have a strong point of view, which they fiercely express. By their very nature they are designed to spark debate, not search for answers; focus our concerns, not reach a bipartisan compromise. But in sparking debate that plays off of our fears and concerns, they also act to drive out rational discussion and reasoned debate. Their very function as hosts and provocateurs can serve to drive us apart. The influence of talk-show hosts on today’s political culture is pervasive and worth exploring in more detail. Some have called such pundits and provocateurs perpetual conflict  machines. Others have called their shows echo chambers, where the hosts simply preach to the choir. Whatever you call this phenomenon, the point is that the current state of media and public affairs is stifling the genuine give-and-take of honest debate. Every day a stream of snarky , loud, and sometimes angry voices from the Left and Right are giving reinforcement, reassurance, and endless coverage to one or the other political extreme. This is what lies behind our common perception that “the crazies are the ones doing all the talking.” To a large extent, they are.                 
                

            
                But when these provocateurs—in politics and the media— are challenged on their crass appeals to fear, anger, and hate, they counter by charging their critics with “political correctness” and claim objectors are attempting to censor them. It is a strategy that has stymied many critics. Casual observers see the deterioration of important debates on the issues into a carnival sideshow, with the clowns running an entertaining, distracting, emotionally charged, but not very informative spectacle. I believe most Americans would passionately embrace reasoned, honest debate on the issues, but they don’t know how to stop the drivel and personal attacks. And critics in government certainly don’t want to risk speaking out too loudly for fear of being targeted for attack by provocateurs on the other side. It has made it harder for the American people to see when politically correct thinking is really being used not to open a debate but to shut one down, such as the NPR response to my debate with Bill O’Reilly about Muslims and terrorism.                 
                

            
                The reality of much of American media today makes a movie fantasy such as ""The American President"" ever more appealing- someone in authority finally stands up to politics and media run amok. The nation would love for a political Super man to take to task the growing horde that has no interest in solving the serious problems facing America.                 
                

            
                Let’s face it, these professional rude boys (and girls) thrive on arousing people’s passions. They make money by making our problems even worse. The more bitter the divide over an issue, the more intractable the problem, the brighter they shine. So they make us afraid of problems; they belittle and demonize those with a different point of view as enemies—even political allies who are not willing to be as extreme or radical in their views. We are given superb political theater but little in the way of education. It is like watching a docudrama at times. Yes, it is based on the facts, but they have been embellished, made more entertaining, with none of the painful searching and uncertainty of real life.                
                

            
                The provocateurs delight in coming up with demeaning, cutting sound bites that quickly go viral on the Internet and cable news. My colleague Glenn Beck has been guilty of this repeatedly. Such attacks and personal put-downs attract attention, as well as condemnation from critics. Nonetheless, the spotlight, good or bad, brings the provocateurs to the attention of even more people, putting more people in the seats for their carnival act. And that puts more money in their pockets. It is entertaining among their constituents, to be sure. But their vitriolic displays scare good people away from getting involved in politics, and they have led smart, well-informed people in the political middle to stay away from important debates. The perpetual conflict machine these agitators have created favors entrenched constituencies that are looking not so much for real debate with new ideas and hope for compromise as much as for confirmation of the beliefs they already hold. Their audiences are captivated by the explosive anger they see on the air, arousing their own anger and frustration.                
                

            
                This phenomenon has reached the point where our provocateur culture inhibits the functions of government. Our public servants increasingly respond first to the loudest voices behind the biggest microphones, who can make them or break them in the opinion polls and at the ballot box. The result is a chronic hardening of political views that is destroying the flexibility needed for effective democracy. But today’s politicians fee l they have little choice but to play along. After all, the prophets of doom and destruction get people to attend rallies, to give money to politicians, and to get out and vote. Candidates running for office, and even those politicians in elected office now, find it to their advantage to mimic the screaming, hectoring, and finger-pointing instead of looking for compromise and solutions. Anyone who varies from their party's hard line is condemned and ultimately muzzled.                 
                

            
                The First Amendment to the Constitution gives everyone the right to speak without fear of government censorship or reprisal. It allows me to earn a living doing what I love to do—talking and writing about politics. Of course, it does not guarantee there will be an audience when I exercise that right. Sometimes bells and whistles, fireworks and sparkles are needed to attract an audience. Sometimes we nee d political theater to get us into our seats. But this nee d also creates programs with attitude and opinion. Most of the programming day at Fox News Channel is taken up with news presented by working journalists collecting the facts and presenting compelling stories. The channel strives to maintain and grow an audience by providing a mixture of honest, original, and engaging analysis and news. But it also offers a variety of potent talk shows on the issues of the day with hosts and guests who have big personalities. Fox CEO Roger Ailes recognizes that the media is a demanding, competitive business and the audience cannot be taken for granted. Attractive, engaging, provocative people and compelling arguments are always in demand.                 
                

            
                Whenever I appear on Fox News or write a column for The Hill, I try to meet the economic demands of those outlets by advancing the conversation, avoiding the predictable, and making a constructive contribution to the discussion. I make a conscious effort to avoid ad hominem attacks or name-calling. I attack ideas and point out their consequences, rather than attack the people who hold them. I don’t say things just for the sake of being provocative. I criticize both liberals and conservatives when I think they are wrong and agree with them when I think they are right, trying to keep my arguments grounded in honesty , civility , and rational thought. As a result, the larger-than-life media personalities—who never entertain any doubt of their fixed position—occasionally shout me down and upstage me. But I give them full credit for having me on in the first place to present what is sometimes a contradicting point of view. I want both left -wing and right-wing audiences to pay attention to what I have to say because they know me as someone who is straight with them, who doesn’t come at the issues from a fixed ideological position. I put a premium on telling them what I really think, and they seem to value that. My bet is that the audience wants to hear what I will say, too, even if they can’t count on me as reliably conservative or liberal.                 
                

            
                Of course, caustic political commentary and satire has a cherished, well-established tradition in American history. Mark Twain, H. L. Mencken, Will Rogers, Dorothy Parker, and scores of other satirists could have been described as political provocateurs in their day. We celebrate their work and can recall their most memorable quotes. When they wrote, the media environment was smaller, slower, less complicated, and less significant in American politics. But as media has evolved over the last several decades, political commentators have become an entirely different species. Today political partisanship has become institutionalized as media technology has increased outlets for niche points of view on the extremes of the political spectrum, and the money and celebrity flow to those voices at the extremes through radio shows, book deals, and Web traffic.                 
                

            
                Much of the history of provocateurs in America is part of the glorious history of free people speaking freely—democracy in action. These voices emerged to challenge the status quo or in some cases to defend the status quo against the forces of political correctness, both good and bad. Some of our nation’s most heated debates took place during the post-revolutionary era as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton argued passionately over the details of our nation’s democratic blueprints, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.                 
                

            
                Thomas Paine is among the most renowned of the founding era provocateurs. He is the original American agitator, an immigrant to the United States who wrote the inflammatory ""Common Sense."" His treatise, which railed against British colonial domination, was intended to inflame and goad Americans to rebellion. He wrote in bold language: “Everything that is right or reasonable pleads for separation. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, ’TIS TIME TO PART.” His words made the American Revolution much more than an uprising. He transformed it into a holy crusade for all humanity.                 
                

            
                “The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind,” Paine wrote.                 
                

            
                By the late 1800s, Paine’s pugnacious phrases seemed polite and poetic compared to the daily vitriol printed by the two great newspaper magnates of the time, William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer. Their coverage of the news, from crime to political scandals to war, was a study in sensationalized accounts, including outright distortion and lies, in a battle to sell more papers in New York City . The high-decibel contest between Hearst’s New York Journal and Pulitzer’s New York World gave rise to the term “yellow journalism.” It describes alarmist, sensationalist journalism that is driven by a desire for attention and is willing to incite and provoke readers with little regard for the facts. Hearst and Pulitzer became infamous for starting a real war. They whipped up so much anger at Spain through inflammatory stories about Spain’s handling of American vessels that they incited the United States to go to war with Spain in the Spanish-American War.                 
                

            
                Radio had emerged in the early twentieth century as a form of mass media. The best-known voice of early thunder on radio was Catholic priest Charles Coughlin. Father Coughlin spewed an inflammatory mix of political outrage, social controversy, and division. President Roosevelt used radio to reach out to a country struggling to recover from economic depression; his use of radio was a first for a president, and his occasional fireside radio chats from the White House became a signature of his presidency. Father Coughlin first gained prominence as a supporter of President Roosevelt’s New Deal programs. But he turned against them with equal fury. He blamed Jews for the Great Depression, sympathized with Hitler, and became an ardent opponent of U.S. involvement in World War II. He once broadcast a question that combined isolationism and anti-Semitism: “Must the entire world go to war for 600,000 Jews in Germany who are neither American, nor French, nor English citizens, but citizens of Germany?” His popularity fell, however, when he was linked to a group trying to overthrow the government.                 
                

            
                The cold war, with its strong anti-communist sentiments, produced several early versions of today’s provocative media personalities. Fear of communist infiltration into the United States stirred the audiences of that era. Radio shows, pamphlets, and speeches were sponsored by the paranoid, far-right John Birch Society .                
                

            
                 The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, too, produced a class of racial provocateurs. Several states added some version of the Confederate flag to their state flags. Alabama’s Governor George Wallace propelled himself to national prominence and a third-party candidacy for the presidency using a “states’ rights” argument, as well as championing the “good” of racial segregation. In June 1963 Governor Wallace drew world attention when he physically stood in a schoolhouse door to block black students from entering the University of Alabama. With TV cameras rolling, and in defiance of the U.S. Justice Department officials standing next to him, he announced that the federal action to integrate the school was “in violation of rights reserved for the state by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of Alabama.” Later, he stirred warlike passion by proclaiming, “In the name of the greatest people that ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny and I say, ‘Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!’ ”                
                

            
                Wallace’s success as a political provocateur was aided by his prominence as governor of the state. But it was also bolstered by the growth of mass media—radio and TV—that trumpeted his words to every corner of the nation.                 
                

            
                In the era of domestic social upheaval during the 1960s and 1970s, the leaders of the feminist movement, the student protests against the Vietnam War, and the civil rights movement all capitalized on the growth of TV news and commentary to build support for their causes. Every cause now had to make strategic decisions on the use of visuals, signs, and symbols intended to display disdain for the establishment, as well as when to stage marches for maximum television coverage, how to increase time on TV by employing Hollywood celebrities to speak for a cause, and how to enlist musicians and messages in movies to agitate for change.                 
                

            
                Ronald Reagan’s presidency saw political polarization reach another level. President Reagan’s professional acting and speech-making skills, combined with the birth of TV cable news and the talk/news radio format, turned politics into televised contests of rhetoric and staging. Working with a public relations expert, Michael Deaver, as his communications director, the president led the nation with bold language and powerful settings for his speeches. He stood at the Berlin Wall to challenge Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev with the line, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.” He did not hesitate to label the Soviet Union “the evil empire.” He antagonized his liberal critics by talking about poor women as welfare queens in “pink Cadillacs,” taking the bold economic position that if the rich got richer the poor would also be helped because “a rising tide lifts all boats.” Consideration of one Reagan nominee for the Supreme Court, Robert Bork, transformed televised Senate confirmation hearings into a stage for political fights over abortion, race, gun control, and every other hotbutt on issue. As noted earlier, during the Bork hearings, Senator Ted Kennedy unleashed his own inflammatory attack on the nominee . “Robert Bork’s America,” the senator said, “is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens’ doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens.”                 
                

            
                Talk shows began to combine the techniques of news programs with entertainment shows. Phil Donahue’s TV show, which was syndicated nationally for a record twenty -six years, set the standard for putting serious conversations on the air in the afternoon, but his show also became known for tackling taboo subjects and bringing lightning-rod personalities on to discuss them. Up-and-coming TV producers followed in his footsteps and often took the format to greater extremes. Geraldo Rivera had his nose broken on an episode of his talk show dealing with “teen hate-mongers,” which featured a member of the White Aryan Resistance Youth and a black guest. Maury Povich became known for revealing the results of paternity tests to couples on live TV, with all the predictable emotional outbursts and tears. Jerry Springer’s show actually rang a bell as guests regularly jumped from their seats in rage to fight one another. Oprah Winfrey’s show became the genre’s most popular in the nation as a more respectable talk show for suburban female viewers, yet it has never strayed far from family feuds, Hollywood’s latest celebrity crisis, and talk about sex and health. But Oprah realized ratings gold in clashes over the day’s explosive social issues.                 
                

            
                As talk shows became TV sensations, radio programming turned up the volume too, with insults, sex talk, sensational political stories, and caricatures of what hosts saw as politically incorrect politicians. Don Imus and Howard Stern soared in the ratings with a combination of humorous put-downs and a willingness to make controversial, even insulting, statements to incite their audiences. Imus’s focus was political, with senators, congressmen, and business leaders oft en joining him to trade gossip, jokes, and put-downs. Stern rode the persona of an overgrown schoolboy skipping class with his friends to have a smoke in the boys’ bathroom and trade titillating locker room talk about sex. The wild success of both shows inspired countless imitators in local radio markets. And the success of these shows led to the explosive growth of reality television, pitting people against one another to reveal that which is most base, primitive, jealous, and violent in us, as reality TV devolved from shows like Survivor to The Real Housewives and Jersey Shore.                
                

            
                As far back as the late 1970s, Patrick Caddell, a political adviser to President Carter, recognized this critical shift in the media, and its power contributed to a change in the nature of governing. He warned the president that it had the power to drive trends and opinions of such force that they could swamp even the most sincere and able leader. Caddell told Carter, “It is my thesis that governing with public approval requires a continuing political campaign.” That meant that even victorious candidates, once in office, had to keep campaigning; they needed to see governing as a separate, sometimes secondary, task if they wanted to hold on to the power that comes from strong public approval. In that sense, a permanent campaign became the equal of a Hearst-Pulitzer circulation battle, a ratings war, and a competition between brands—a quest to seize eyeballs, to capture hearts, and to stir passions. Politicians nee d to absorb the lessons of the media about tapping into the biggest possible audience and holding that audience. The key lesson is that there is nothing less dramatic than a few people talking rationally, ignoring extremists and know-nothings, while making steady, incremental improvements in public policy. Even an uninformed, uneducated rube can beat a brilliant statesman in opinion polls if the rube has passion, presents himself as a victim of Washington’s arrogance, and is willing to take a stand and put on a show of populist outrage.                 
                

            
                In politics, the heated media culture of the 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of three major political personalities who fit the mold of provocateur—Jesse Jackson on the Left , Pat Buchanan on the Right, and Ross Perot as a political independent. Jackson had first used the power of television in the immediate aftermath of Dr. King’s assassination, when he appeared on air the next day wearing a shirt that he said was stained with Dr. King’s blood. Throughout the next several decades, his public statements and appearances on TV and radio spoke of his ambition to become the next Dr. King. By the 1988 presidential campaign, Jackson was widely acknowledged as the “president of Black America,” a meaningless title except in its power to command the attention of the media and win Jackson his own cable TV show.                 
                

            
                Pat Buchanan, a former aide to President Nixon, positioned himself as a social conservative and a man of principle willing to lead the charge in what he called “the culture wars.” It was Buchanan who had coined the term “silent majority .” Buchanan became a regular on political TV and radio shows and eventually landed his own. He was one of the original co-hosts of the cable TV shouting match Crossfire, which created the spit-flying, barbed-put-down, Left -versus-Right template for political panels and programs that have come since. He ran a lucrative newsletter aimed at conservatives see king hard-line right-wing views.                 
                

            
                Like Jesse Jackson, Buchanan made a run for president. In 1992 he used his hard-right stands on social issues to attack President Bush as a political moderate who made “backroom” deals with Democrats and did not deserve a second term. Ross Perot, like Jackson and Buchanan, also ran for president. In an amazing turn, the wealthy corporate executive ran as a populist, a man trained by his success in business to get things done. The hero and protagonist of a best-selling book and TV series, ""On the Wings of Eagles"", about how he organized the rescue of employees being held hostage overseas, Perot presented himself in the news media as a serious leader. He spoke as a no-nonsense pragmatist with a particular distaste for President Bush. In nonstop media interviews, including regular appearances on cable TV’s Larry King Live, he labeled President Bush a weak leader with no economic know-how and lacking in strong principles.                 
                

            
                “This city [Washington] has become a town filled with sound bites, shell games, handlers, media stuntmen who posture, create images, talk, shoot off Roman candles, but don’t ever accomplish anything. We need deeds, not words, in this city ,” Perot said. One of his most telling campaign pledges fit the ever-escalating media culture of the time. He said that as president he would govern by participating in “electronic town halls,” where people could speak out and also register their preferences for policy and legislation.                 
                

            
                But Perot’s erratic behavior, dropping out and then re-entering the presidential race in a media frenzy, and his charge that government agents had tried to ruin his daughter’s wedding, as well as his choice of the unknown and out-of-his-depth Admiral James Stockdale as his vice-presidential running mate, undermined Perot’s candidacy. Nonetheless, he won 19 percent of the vote, a record for an independent candidate. But most of all, Perot, Buchanan, and Jackson left an industry of extreme political pundits in their wake, politicians and talk-show hosts who gained a level of wealth and political power never known to earlier political commentators such as Will Rogers and H. L. Mencken. They prided themselves on being outside observers of the process.                 
                

            
                The current crop of provocateurs, too—from Glenn Beck to Arianna Huffington—have become players in that process. They are rewarded for being the ones who shout the loudest and make the most outrageous attacks, who garner the highest television ratings, the largest radio audiences, and the most Web site traffic. They net lucrative book contracts and receive rapturous standing ovations at political conferences. And they have discovered they can make or break like-minded political candidates with their commentary and endorsements. Voices of moderation and calm persuasion have a hard time being heard over the loud, grating voices of today’s political provocateurs. And the Internet and the communications platforms it has created—from Facebook to blogs—have supported the emergence of even more provocateurs: people paid for screaming out any controversial idea, any conspiracy theory. Most of these agitators act without fear of being held to account for distortions or outright lies. When challenged on the facts, they run behind the First Amendment and charge that their freedom of speech is being taken away. The acolytes in their audience could care less about spin and distortion—unless it is committed by their political foes. They just want to hear a rousing speech by a talk-show host who agrees with them. This psychological phenomenon is one surprising result of technology’s ability to deliver more cable channels, more radio stations, infinite Web sites, and Twitter feeds. With the greater variety of platforms to get news and opinion, most readers, viewers, and listeners are drawn to platforms and personalities of their choice, in the same way hometown audiences become fans of a baseball team. They believe their team can do no wrong. They revel in the company of like-minded thinkers. They really don’t want to hear news that makes them question their political prejudices. They don’t want opinions that challenge the logic of their political thinking by giving a contradictory point of view. They want consistency. They are glad to dismiss critics, the loathsome “mainstream” or “right-wing” media, and opposing political parties. They bond with others as outsiders and get a kick out of personalities who use mocking tones to debase the insiders or elite who disagree with them. It is this new political culture that produced Al Franken and Rush Limbaugh, stand-up comic and disc jockey with brash political views, two funny guys who have risen to unbelievable prominence in the nation’s highest councils of serious political debate.                 
                

            
                Limbaugh is the loudest of all the voices in the conservative media echo chamber. A college dropout and failed disc jockey, he created a one-man political show made possible by the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987. Radio stations no longer had to air opposing views, and Limbaugh is credited with being the first and certainly the best to take advantage of the new law. He beats one ideological drum for three hours a day— the drum of social conservatism. He has made himself into the voice of opposition to everything liberal, from abortion to war protests to concern over torture of captured terrorists and civil rights activists. He lambasted women’s rights activists as “femi-Nazis,” declaring, “Feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society .” He mocked AIDS activists by introducing any discussion of the disease with Dionne Warwick’s hit song “I’ll Never Love This Way Again.” On Limbaugh’s show, members of the military who did not agree with President Bush’s decision to invade Iraq were “phony” soldiers. He showed no fear of making the kind of racial politics put-downs of black people that have sunk other talk-show hosts. Limbaugh once told a black caller to “take the bone out of your nose and call me back.” His take on the majority of black Americans identifying with the Democratic Party? “They’re only 12 percent of the population. Who the hell cares?” One time he remarked that all composite pictures of criminals look like Jesse Jackson. A big football fan, he nonetheless disparaged the large number of professional players who are black by saying: “The NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons.” This episode was cited as one of the reasons NFL power brokers blocked Limbaugh’s attempt to buy an ownership stake in the St. Louis Rams football team in 2009. After the plan fell through, liberal comedian and talk-show host Bill Maher joked that this had dashed Limbaugh’s lifelong dream of one day owning black people.                 
                

            
                Limbaugh’s comedic talent, his mimicry, his use of music, and his buffoon-like boast that he is taking on the Left with “half my brain tied behind my back” led the New York Times to describe him as a “vaudevillian.” When Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican Party , described the radio talk-show host as merely “an entertainer” who stirred up his audience with “incendiary” and “ugly” comments, he found himself deluged with rebukes from the Rush “ditto heads” and threatened with a loss of financial support for the party . So despite Steele’s political standing within the party , he bowed his head, offered a personal apology to “El Rushbo,” and appeared chastened, even abject, when he beseeched the entertainer to go easy on him. As President Obama entered the White House at a time of war, terror threats, and economic crisis, Limbaugh baldly said, “I hope he fails.” He later tried to explain that he was talking only about the president’s liberal policies, but the un- apologetic comment, indifferent to the needs of the nation but crafted to grab attention, fit Limbaugh perfectly.                
                

            
                Limbaugh’s sharp tongue has made him the most successful radio broadcaster of all time. His eponymous radio show, which began in 1988, now has an estimated weekly audience of fifteen million listeners. According to a Newsweek report last year, he is by far the highest-earning political personality , earning $59 million annually. For reference, Glenn Beck came in second at $33 million. In third was Sean Hannity at $22 million. Limbaugh’s stature is all the more impressive when you consider that his show saved the AM radio frequency from irrelevance. Conservative talk-radio hosts ever since have copied the Limbaugh model.                 
                

            
                The success of right-wing talk radio in shaping national political opinions and policy eventually prompted the question, Why don’t liberals have their own talk shows? The answer was that liberals did not feel alienated from what conservatives called the “mainstream media.” The older, white majority of conservatives had long complained that they were ignored or marginalized as religious extremists, sexual prudes, and bigots by the major newspapers and broadcast networks. And the liberal tilt in Hollywood produced popular liberal-leaning TV sitcoms going back as far as All in the Family, in which a conservative blue-collar worker was presented as uneducated, full of blustering resistance to treating women and blacks as equals. The movies promoted liberal themes, including racial integration, premarital sex, and disdain for the American military, from M*A*S*H to Platoon. On the radio dial, NPR got its start in the early seventies as a network of college stations. Its first big news story was the Watergate scandal and the congressional hearings that followed, with President Nixon as the villain. NPR was immediately adopted by the campus protest crowd and liberal intellectuals.                 
                

            
                Conservatives had complained for decades that liberals tended to win tenured faculty positions at the nation’s top universities. NPR became an extension of liberal campus counterculture. To conservatives, the arrival of right-wing talk radio on the AM dial created a singular outpost for their views in a liberal media landscape. But to liberals and Democrats the success of conservatives like Limbaugh and their power to push national politics to the right was maddening. Liberal counter programming fi nally hit the airwaves in 2004 with a new radio outfit called Air America Radio. And its star, the Left ’s answer to Rush Limbaugh, was the comedian and satirist Al Franken.                 
                

            
                Unlike Limbaugh, Franken was a top-notch student who graduated from Harvard with a degree in political science. And he had been a star on a hip, liberal-leaning TV show, Saturday Night Live, for fifteen years. In 1996 Franken wrote a New York Times best-selling book with the insulting, scathing title Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations. In 2004 Franken was selected to host Air America’s main show. He was seen as the man to take on Limbaugh as well as the successful Fox News Channel and its lead personality , Bill O’Reilly. Franken initially called his show The O’Franken Factor. But the show’s preoccupation with mocking conservative radio and cable personalities did not lead to ratings success. Franken left it within three years as the network struggled to pay its bills and then collapsed.                 
                

            
                But Franken found another outlet in real-life politics. He had written a second book, titled ""Why Not Me?"", a satirical account of a fictional Franken campaign for president. And in one of those bizarre moments when life imitates absurdist art, Franken actually ran in 2008 for a real U.S. Senate seat in his home state of Minnesota and won in a very close race over a Republican incumbent. In the Senate, he made news when he rolled his eyes and made faces of disgust while Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell spoke in opposition to a Democratic nominee to the Supreme Court. That prompted McConnell to rebuke him with the comment “This isn’t Saturday Night Live, Al.” (Franken later wrote a handwritten letter of apology to McConnell for using his comic training on the floor of the Senate when real issues were being debated.) But what was astounding was the elevation of Franken, a man best known for clowning and political satire, a man with no prior political experience, to a seat in the U.S. Senate. Franken may now be maturing in the job, but his background is as a heckler and provocateur.                 
                

            
                There is a vast constellation of stars like Limbaugh and Franken now blanketing the media and politics. On the Left there is Michael Moore, the most successful documentary filmmaker of all time. He is a folk hero of the American Left who is praised on college campuses, on the liberal cable channels, and in the progressive netroots community . Arianna Huffington, the Republican pundit turned liberal firebrand, created an incredibly successful Web site, the Huffington Post, which provides liberals with news and opinion. The Huffi ngton Post has been so successful that she was able to sell it to AOL for $315 million earlier this year. Lawrence O’Donnell, one of MSNBC’s most popular liberal commentators, now hosts the network’s 8:00 p.m. show, which competes with Bill O’Reilly.                
                

            
                On the Right, Rush Limbaugh’s legacy has spawned a plethora of conservative talk-radio hosts who have followed in his path: Sean Hannity , Michael Savage, Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin, Neal Boortz, and Mike Gallagher. Each one has achieved success by parlaying his or her radio show into television appearances and book deals. Perhaps the most fascinating example is Glenn Beck, who attracts the third-biggest audience in conservative talk radio, behind Limbaugh and Hannity . Like Limbaugh, Beck never graduated from college and had a checkered career as a disc jockey playing pranks and hit records. Beck began his political talk show in 2000 on a Tampa, Florida, AM station, mixing conservatism and conspiracy theories. In dark, whispered voices he claimed liberals were plotting to destroy America, while also confessing to his life as a recovering alcoholic and conveying occasional religious messages.                 
                

            
                In addition to his radio show, with a weekly audience of about ten million listeners, Beck had a 5:00 p.m. show on Fox News that garnered higher ratings than the combined ratings for prime-time programs on CNN and MSNBC. His books instantly catapult to number one on the New York Times bestseller lists. Though not as partisan as Limbaugh, Beck’s message is clearly conservative and highly critical of the Democrats and President Obama. He famously remarked that the president was a “racist” who had a “deep-seated hatred of white people.” In fairness, he apologized and retracted that remark later. But he routinely calls the president a socialist, a communist, and a Marxist and has likened him to Adolf Hitler. He 232  oft en compares the agenda of Obama and the Democrats to Nazi Germany, Maoist China, and Russia under the Soviets. The philippics and outlandish tirades against the Obama administration form the engine for Beck’s success. Without them, no one would pay attention to his warmer, fuzzier, and sometimes legitimate claims about history, morals, and values. But rather than spark a genuine debate, Beck seeks to ignite our ire and go on the attack. There is no progressive conspiracy to destroy the United States of America from within, and it is absurd to suggest that there is. Although to Beck and those who follow him, it may well seem as if I am dismissing the idea because I am a part of the conspiracy. For that matter, you must be too, if you agree with my ideas. I can see the chalkboard diagram now.                 
                

            
                These provocateurs cross the political spectrum and are paid salaries normally associated with Las Vegas entertainers. Personality is key here. Anyone can say provocative things and voice controversial opinions. The people whom I have mentioned are effective because they are always skating on the edge of outrageous controversy, always pushing the limits of supportable facts, logic, and respect for people who hold opposing political views. Their audiences want to see how far they can go without crashing. Perhaps they share the sense that the rest of the world is crazy and they are not going to take it anymore—they are going to set the record straight and tell it like it is. And our hosts deliver daily jeremiads that confirm we are not the only ones who believe these politicians and world leaders and corporate moguls and pampered movie stars and athletes are a bunch of thieves, liars, and idiots. The iron fist hammering the table with the microphone belongs to a man or woman—conservative or liberal—who is not interested in talking with people. He or she is in the business of talking at people. The closest these dominating radio and TV personalities come to an exchange of ideas is attacking their rivals on another network. The insults fly, and then their respective audiences are roused to defend their heroes, and the ratings climb even higher as more and more people tune in for the spectacle.                 
                

            
                Now, there is nothing wrong with talk radio being dominated by conservative personalities or Hollywood being dominated by liberal writers and actors. Competition among political ideas is essential to American democracy. It might be hard to fi nd a liberal radio show as influential as Rush Limbaugh’s program, but there is no absence of liberal ideas and personalities elsewhere in the political universe and the media. At the height of their powers, the conservatives on talk radio could only watch as perhaps the most liberal member of the Senate, Barack Obama, was elected president. That is why I will stand side by side with Rush and Sean in opposing attempts to manipulate that marketplace with the return of the Fairness Doctrine. President Obama has also said he opposes the return of a government-imposed mandate that each individual station provide equal time to all sides of a political issue. At this point that kind of legislative response to the provocateurs will not serve to disseminate more ideas and opinions. It amounts to a liberal strategy designed to take down Limbaugh and the other conservatives who dominate one format—talk radio. I am for the government offering tax breaks to support more programs with local talk and news. Having been muzzled myself, I don’t think muzzling other voices or having the government dictate programming decisions is in keeping with the First Amendment promise that Congress will make no law restricting freedom of the press. The real danger here is beyond the scope of government’s power. The excess of provocateurs corrupting public dialogue in America sets up a fight on every issue for every American. This rebellion against the provocateurs will have to be done in the tradition of colonial patriots, who came out of their homes and formed private armies to fight British tyranny.                 
                

            
                Individual Americans are going to have to turn away from the entertainment associated with extremist, at times buffoonish, demagogues on the air and their imitators who are now running for public office. They will have to personally raise the bar for conversations about important social and political issues. In other words, we have to take matters into our own hands. Ordinary Americans nee d to join the fight against the scourge that is undermining our essential American belief in letting people speak their minds. The dominance of the paid agitators has led to a loss of critical-thinking skills by American citizens—we nee d to think for ourselves. The screamers, the self-righteous, and the arrogant on radio, on TV, in print, and on the Internet create an environment in which a lot of people in the middle don’t bother speaking up because it’s hard to shout above the bombast and noise. A lot of us, I suspect, feel an urge to take cover until all the shouting and name-calling stop. We are waiting for someone else to tell the provocateurs that their fifteen minutes are up.                
                

            
                I fear that a backlash against the provocateur culture is creating cynicism about the entire political process. Revulsion for politics and debate is now common among Americans, especially young people. And that path leads to political apathy. Two thirds of the American people tell pollsters the country is headed in the wrong direction. Yet increasingly, politicians themselves begin to act like the provocateurs in the media, resorting to the same crass schoolyard bullying and name-calling. In one of the most offensive campaign ads of the 2010 political campaign, a Florida Democrat, Representative Alan Grayson, referred to his Republican opponent, Daniel Webster, as “Taliban Dan.” Labeling someone, even in hyperbole, a member of a brutal regime that slaughters its own people, and Americans for that matter, is bad enough. But on top of that, the vitriol behind the statements was based on a lie. Grayson used a video clip that showed Webster telling women to “submit” to their husbands in keeping with the tenets of an extremist interpretation of the Bible. But Grayson had edited the clip to distort what Webster had actually said. In reality , Webster had cautioned religious men not to use literal translations of some Bible texts to oppress women.                 
                

            
                The independent political watchdog group FactCheck.org was appalled by Grayson’s blatant attack on his opponent and the truth. “We thought Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson of Florida reached a low point when he falsely accused his opponent of being a draft dodger during the Vietnam War and of not loving his country,” reported FactCheck.org. “But now Grayson has lowered the bar even further. He’s using edited video to make his rival appear to be saying the opposite of what he really said.”                 
                

            
                The 2010 election also saw Sharron Angle, the Republican candidate for a Nevada U.S. Senate seat, tell a group of voters that she would employ gun violence—“Second Amendment remedies”—to deal with members of Congress who did not go along with her ideas. She made headlines with the sensationalist but totally false charge that her Democratic opponent, Senate majority leader Harry Reid, wanted to give Viagra to sex off enders. Angle also ran ads suggesting Reid was giving tax breaks to illegal immigrants. Those TV ads depicted the people crossing the border to come into the United States as thuggish, threatening, and dark skinned, in a crass attempt to stir up voters’ fears and win votes.                 
                

            
                This low level of political discourse is chasing away talented people who would otherwise put themselves forward as candidates for office. Who wants to be subjected to shrill and malicious attacks? Who wants to be called names and verbally kicked around by opponents who are not held to account? In every democracy, no matter what the era, the language of politics is oft en personal, oft en harsh, and at times down in the gutter. This was true of political opponents of Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Abe Lincoln. But the proliferation of media through high technology in the last twenty years has led to 24-7 stabs from sharp voices, and I fear the body politic is bleeding to death. There is no off -season for political attacks, especially around election time. We now live with a permanent campaign; it is a year-round sport. From terrorism to budgetary crises to immigration to the war in wherever, the talk-show static is so loud that voices of elected officials trying their best to resolve thorny political issues can barely be heard. The result is that a genuine dialogue about important issues gets put off far too long. The urgent need for solutions, combined with our anxiety over a faltering economy, multiple wars, and demographic shifts that have raised the number of racial minorities and immigrants, has created a political pressure cooker. The only sound to be heard is the angry steam venting from overheated people.                 
                

            
                That is what happened during the debate over health-care reform in 2010. America’s great tradition of town halls where citizens can express concerns to elected officials devolved into circus-tent spectacles, in which every shriek mimicked the harsh rhetoric, angry tone, and personal insults that typify the media provocateurs Americans listen to and watch daily. And the hostile tenor of the meetings was set by those provocative personalities. During a debate on health care, freshman Senate Democrat Al Franken, sitting as presiding officer of the Senate, cut off Senator Joe Lieberman, the senior senator from Connecticut. “Wielding Gavel, Franken Shuts Lieberman Up!” is how the incident was delightedly described in the liberal-leaning Huffington Post. Given that a request to finish a brief ten-minute speech is commonly granted in the Senate, the decision had the flavor of disrespect. And the fact that Senator Franken, a former entertainer, was the lead actor prompted Senator John McCain to lament the demise of civility even among senators. “I’ve been around here for more than twenty years,” McCain said, “and yesterday on the floor of the Senate, the senator from Connecticut was finishing his remarks . . . and was objected to by the newest member of the U.S. Senate—and in the most brusque way.” Later he added: “That’s how the comity in this body has deteriorated. We got to stop—we got to stop this kind of behavior.”                 
                

            
                Senator McCain’s complaint came barely two months after Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina broke traditional decorum at a presidential address to a joint session of Congress to yell, “You lie!” That disrespect was unprecedented, and the congressman was wrong on the facts, as well. At a Massachusetts town-hall meeting during the same period, Representative Barney Frank went toe-to-toe with a woman who held up a sign featuring President Obama portrayed as Adolf Hitler. She asked her congressman why he was “supporting this Nazi policy.” Frank responded: “On what planet do you spend most of your time?” The honest answer is that she is living on a planet full of provocateurs on her radio, TV, and Internet. Former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin used the Internet to contribute to the poisonous atmosphere in town-hall meetings in 2010. Just before the congressional summer recess and the beginning of the townhall meetings, she wrote on her Facebook page: “The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Downs Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide . . . [a citizen’s] level of productivity in society [and] whether they are worthy of healthcare.” This misleading description of the provisions of national health-care reform was surprising, and disappointing, given that Palin regularly confronted the media for making things up about her.                 
                

            
                Some people might regard the passionate outbursts during the town halls as over-the-top but within the limits of democracy in action. But something different was going on here. The fact that there were so many threats of violence and vicious, personal insults exchanged and posted on YouTube leads to questions about the direction of American political culture and the impact of the provocateurs. Where are they taking us? Is this where we want to go as a country? Surely there were serious people who came to these town halls wanting to get answers to questions about the health-care bill and to hear informative debate on the issue. Polls had consistently shown for decades that Americans, both individuals and businesses, have been burdened by the high cost of health care and wanted reforms. But the town-hall meetings were not about weighing the comparative impact of reform proposals. The goal seemed to be an exercise in mockery, cynicism, and even contempt for the political system. There is no way the town halls were good for debating legislation. Spectacles like these undermine the functioning of governments of any political stripe and are a threat to a vital, healthy democracy.                
                

            
                Robert Reich, who was secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, wrote about touring the country to see some of the town halls. He realized that the provocateur media culture had been hijacked by the lobbyists and businessmen opposed to health-care reform to create a circus that fed the right-wing radio talk shows and TV cable programs in an attempt to shoot reform down. It then inspired more threats and further hysteria at future town hall meetings.                 
                

            
                “On our drive across America,” Reich wrote at Salon.com, “my son and I have spotted spiffy white vans emblazoned with phrases like ‘ObamaCare Will Raise Your Taxes,’ and ‘ObamaCare Will Put Bureaucrats in Charge of Your Health.’ Just outside Omaha we drove close enough to take a peek at the driver, who looked as dutifully professional as the spanking new van he was driving. This isn’t grassroots. It’s Astroturf. The vans carry the logo ‘Americans for Prosperity ,’ one of the Washington front groups orchestrating the fight against universal health [coverage].” Reich went on to write that these front groups used the ethos of the provocateurs to “stage ersatz local anti–universal health rallies, and fill hometown media with carefully crafted, market-tested messages demonizing healthcare reform.”                 
                

            
                Reich is obviously a partisan with a point of view. And not everyone opposed to health-care reform is an agent for the lobbyists or a member of the Republican Party . But his observation that professional political and industry groups were deliberately creating media spectacles to advance their financial and political interests is exactly right. It must be noted that liberals also use the tactic. When Wisconsin governor Scott Walker proposed budget cuts and new restrictions on collective bargaining for public-sector unions, opponents did not make their case in debates. They staged spectacular protest rallies that played to the cameras and microphones and starred celebrities like Michael Moore. Those protests clearly had a lot of Reich’s “Astroturf” in them. In this case unions and the state’s Democratic Party supplied the artifice. In fact, fourteen Democratic state senators actually fled the state, preventing the majority Republicans from being able to move the bill through the legislature. The spectacle of the Democrats in hiding included one state senator being interviewed on Good Morning America fr om an “undisclosed location.”                 
                

            
                On the one hand, stripping public unions of their right to collective bargaining is drastic, especially without full discussion. Moreover, the unions had accepted many of the governor’s proposals—they had agreed to contribute more to their pensions and health-care plans. It was the governor’s attempt to unilaterally strip the unions of bargaining rights that set off the ruckus. Now we are left with boiling-mad, entrenched parties who are incapable of civil, reasoned debate in service to the public good. One side, the Democrats, left the legislature in an act of theater and political gamesmanship instead of agreeing to talk. But Governor Scott did not seem open to debate and persuasion, at least from the Democrats’ perspective.                 
                

            
                Nonetheless, he is the elected governor of the state of Wisconsin. As President Obama famously said: “Elections have consequences and at the end of the day I won.” This is equally true for the Republicans in the Wisconsin state house. To have Democratic legislators run away to deny the governor the quorum necessary for a vote when he had enough votes to win amounted to hijacking our republican form of government. To me, what happened in Wisconsin confirmed that we have entered an era of stunt governing. This goes beyond the pointless screaming discussions among extremists and provocateurs on the talk shows. Now governing, too, has become one big sideshow in which serious issues and the needs of the people can’t be honestly debated and settled; government officials reduce themselves to Beltway versions of the provocateurs. They introduce meaningless legislation to ban Sharia law in Oklahoma or call for President Obama to make public his birth certificate. There is no substance to these acts except to produce headlines and more peppery grist to be chewed over on the partisan talk shows. An outrageous waste of taxpayer time and money by elected officials is tolerated and accepted. And rational voices attempting to do the hard work of see king compromise on big issues know that highly partisan primaries will ambush and punish them for even talking to the other side of the aisle. The provocateurs have led the way to an age in which stunt governing and ineffectual leadership now are 242  the rule. The megaphone of the provocateur culture has overwhelmed deliberation and genuine attempts at legislation. The voice of honest debate in America has been muzzled. And as those voices of honest debate have grown silent, the quality of our political institutions has been diminished. Those townhall meetings, school-board meetings, and joint sessions of Congress determine the viability of the American experiment and all the dreams it embodies. We can’t afford to lose them.
