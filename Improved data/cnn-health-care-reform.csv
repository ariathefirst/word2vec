"What to expect on Obamacare, taxes and spending under Trump","After several decades of policy stalemate in Washington, cynics might conclude that the Trump era will be more of the same. Think again. Significant change is coming if only because the GOP controls both Houses of Congress, along with the White House.  True, some analysts argue that serious divisions within the GOP will make it tough to achieve policy consensus. But Republican congressional leaders give three reasons why civil war is unlikely and big change is coming fast. First, the fact that the GOP lost so few House seats in last month's election gives House Speaker Paul Ryan a lot more ideological room to negotiate. Had some of the polls been correct and the GOP lost 20-22 seats, leaving the thinnest of majorities, the Republican House today would indeed be ungovernable. Second, Republicans are terrified that if they don't deliver, the same working-class voters who turned on Hillary Clinton will turn on them. And third, Republicans have a definite fear of Donald Trump himself, whose coattails in last month's election were surprisingly strong. Obstructionists will almost certainly be the subject of ridicule in a  Trump tweet. Here's how the next six months could unfold: Tax plans Trump and the GOP House leadership have surprisingly similar tax reform plans. Both include reform of the corporate and individual tax codes. Both plans have identical reductions in individual tax rates (with brackets down to 12, 25, and 33%) and are fairly similar in what they propose for other provisions of the tax code.  The tax plan agreed to by both Trump and the Congressional GOP will almost certainly be achieved through the legislative vehicle called reconciliation, which means only 51 votes are needed for passage (the GOP has a 52-48 Senate majority). Translation: Immune to being filibustered, their plan will likely become law very quickly.  The greatest difference to be resolved centers on individual taxation at the highest tax bracket. Team Trump, while lowering the top tax rate for upper-income earners, would reduce deductions such that the net effect would be no change in total taxes paid by those at this bracket. Congressional GOP tax plans would bring the top tax rate down but leave enough deductions such that the upper-income taxpayers would receive a tax cut, as measured by total taxes paid. High income vs. middle-class tax cuts How this difference will be resolved,  and other details of the tax code (number and size of exemptions and deductions), will be determined depending in part on how Senate Republicans and the Trump administration respond to the House Republicans' decision more than a year ago to use ""dynamic scoring"" to determine the revenue implications from various tax policy changes. The move to dynamic scoring originated from the House Ways and Means Committee and suggests that tax policy can stimulate the economy, increasing tax revenues somewhat. No, tax rate cuts cannot pay for themselves, but they do generate some economic activity and thereby increase revenues, proponents argue. How GOP differences are resolved on dynamic scoring will determine the number and size of deductions left in the tax code. Depending on how Congress scores the revenue loss, for example, the top corporate tax rate, which is now 39%, could be reduced to as low as 15% or as high as 20%.  On the issue of whether the final tax plan, while reducing the top tax rate, has no net tax cut (Trump Plan) or a net tax cut (House GOP Plan), watch for Trump to have the upper hand. The likely outcome is that high-income earners will receive a net tax cut, but not nearly as generous as congressional GOP tax writers propose, meaning a significantly larger net tax cut is in store for the middle class. Both approaches would entail significant revenue losses and the deficit would grow.  Future of Obamacare? Candidate Trump vowed to ""kill"" Obamacare. The GOP could accomplish that goal immediately using the vehicle of reconciliation, which again only requires 51 votes to eliminate the part of the legislation that finances the program.  Republicans sense they need to send their core constituency the message that they took action to kill a plan that has allowed health care premiums and deductions to skyrocket. But the politics are tricky. The implementation of any legislative action will likely be delayed, probably until after the 2018 midterm elections. Here's why: Replacing Obamacare with some new health care system cannot be done through reconciliation, which is a special legislative approach limited to financial and budgetary matters. Instead, enacting an entirely new health care plan requires the legislative track called ""regular order"" which requires 60 votes for passage (by overcoming a certain filibuster) and therefore will need the support of a number of Democratic senators. That sounds like a recipe for legislative stalemate. But there may be a reason a number of Senate Democrats (25 out of 48 are up for re-election in 2018, with 10 coming from so-called ""red"" states) may be willing to compromise with Trump and the Republicans on a health care reform plan.  GOP congressional leaders have been led to believe that by March of next year, every major insurance company now part of the Affordable Care Act will have opted out of the program, having suffered enormous financial losses. Whether Obamacare collapses under its own weight with this exodus remains to be seen. But the largest participant in the program, United Health, has already opted out.  The GOP will delay implementation of any effort to kill Obamacare precisely because of the anticipation  the program will die its own death. So why take the blame for killing it? Both parties would then have no choice but to devise a bipartisan replacement. As one GOP congressional leader told me, ""There are some things the Democrats want that we can live with. Compromise is not out of the question. We'll come up with a new plan. We have to."" 	 Infrastructure: A trillion-dollar question? Finally, there is the issue of infrastructure spending. It is assumed that on the first day of the Trump administration, $1 trillion in infrastructure spending will be dropped from a helicopter onto the US economy. But such an approach is not practical. Instead, a lot of the upcoming infrastructure spending is likely to be stretched out over several years with decisions made in close coordination with state and local governments.  The Republican leadership says it is determined to avoid the Obama administration's experience in 2009 when officials were desperate to find ""shovel ready"" projects to initiate as stimulus in response to the financial crisis. A lot of less-than-essential projects were funded. ""Shovel ready"" in too many cases proved to be a euphemism for ""needless but ready."" But how will Congress finance this new spending? Think big corporations. In 2015, Sen. Chuck Schumer,  D-New York, and then-Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, were engaged in negotiations over the connection of an infrastructure spending plan to a plan for overseas corporate profit repatriation; currently $2.5 trillion in US corporate profits are parked overseas, where tax rates are lower, and could be put to work building the US economy.  Senate leader Harry Reid (retiring this year) stepped in and killed any chance of compromise. Watch for the Schumer-Ryan negotiations to begin again. In their negotiations, any infrastructure spending plan should involve US corporations being asked to purchase a specified amount of low interest rate infrastructure bonds as part of any generous overseas profit repatriation exercise designed to bring the $2.5 trillion back home.  So, here's my crystal ball on what is about to quickly unfold. With upcoming changes to the tax code and replacement of Obamacare, Congress will take the lead. Change will happen relatively quickly, but Team Trump will have influence in keeping the bulk of the stimulus directed at the middle class. But here's the point: The rough outlines of the proposed reforms have already been debated and are on the shelf, waiting to be quickly enacted.  On infrastructure spending, President Trump will likely take the lead. Throughout his first term, the new president will position himself as the hands-on, shirtsleeves-rolled-up ""builder."" In other words, on domestic policy he will appear to be more like a big city Northeast mayor than a traditional conservative Republican president. Trump will regularly visit infrastructure construction sites, with press in tow.  As always, the question is whether the end result avoids a new round of Solyndras, ""bridges to nowhere"" and other nonsense associated with stimulus and infrastructure spending in the past.  The smarter approach would be for the President-elect now to do something that Congress would hate: Establish a distinguished panel of independent experts to decide which projects are funded. This would be similar to the successful military base realignment and closing commission that worked so successfully between 1988 and 2005. But then again, when has Washington ever adopted the smarter approach? Meanwhile, get ready for takeoff."
Romney is back to loving Massachusetts,"As any seasoned observer of the political dance could have predicted, Mitt Romney's debate performance on Wednesday completed his full-circle journey of ideology. When Romney ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 (and for senator in 1994) he was a Republican moderate in the mold of his father. When he began his marathon run(s) for president way back in the middle of the last decade he went through a battlefield conversion. He morphed into a ""severely"" conservative primary candidate, leaning so far to the right he might have suffered from mild attacks of vertigo. Wednesday night a national audience witnessed a kind of homecoming as Romney embraced the successes of his adopted blue state. Romney's ardor for the good times he had as governor came after he spent the last two cycles of Republican primaries ridiculing Massachusetts' liberal tendencies, describing his experience among the lefties as being ""a vegetarian at a cattle ranch.""   The Romney we saw on Wednesday was subtly different. He loved education, hated tax deductions, enjoyed working with Democrats and claimed the Romneycare precursor of Obamacare as his own.  Romney starts to fill in blanks on his tax plan He told the debate's moderator, Jim Lehrer: ""Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87% Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be No. 1 in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times."" In short, he painted a portrait of bipartisan bliss. No surprises there. The passage of presidential candidates from the extreme margins of their parties' base to the center is as predictable as the annual migration of buzzards from Miami to Hinckley, Ohio. Still, as a public service, a quick examination of Romney's new embrace of Massachusetts is in order. But before we get into the details, tuck away this truism on the ways of Massachusetts politics. Governors come and go; the overriding constant is an overwhelming Democratic majority in the state legislature. It has the final, veto-proof say on budgets, laws and policy. To credit any Bay State governor for a balanced budget or blame him for a high unemployment rate is akin to holding him responsible for the weather. Let's take it by categories. Education In the debate, Romney stressed the importance of education, noting more than once that Massachusetts leads the nation in education outcomes. This is largely true, depending on which metric you use (and if you ignore the fact that there are poorer communities in the state that resemble the education outcomes of Mississippi and Texas).  But what was Romney's role in all this? He inherited an education system that had been trending to the top of national rankings over the previous decade. In 2003, the year he took office, Massachusetts high school seniors were first in SAT scores and among the top three in percentage of students taking the test. The state continued to rank at the top during and after Romney's term.  Massachusetts public schools receive state aid under a law called Chapter 70. The budget ritual begins with the governor setting a number for Chapter 70 distributions. That is usually changed when the legislature's budget committees take over. In his 2004 fiscal year proposal (the state's budget calendar runs from July 1 to June 30) Romney actually budgeted more Chapter 70 money than the legislature settled on. But there is an asterisk that goes with that.  Opinion: Romney's demographic bind Romney's plan would have robbed Peter to pay Paul, cutting other state aid to municipalities to fund his largess to education. The legislature smoothed the differences by returning some of the education money to the other account. In subsequent budget years the legislature raised Romney's proposed education funding by amounts ranging from $3 million to $50 million on total Chapter 70 funding of $3 billion annually, according to state records.   Romney gets average marks when it comes to other education issues. His administration launched no major initiatives or reforms. Higher education funding and the state university system's infrastructure languished in his four years as governor -- a time, to be fair, when there was little additional money in the budget.   Budget/Taxes Romney brags that he didn't raise taxes in Massachusetts even though the state budget faced a $3 billion budget gap when he took office. It is true; he didn't. Instead he proposed, and the legislature accepted, dozens of increases on state fees. Marriage licenses went from $4 to $50. The cost of registering deeds and mortgages quadrupled ($25 to $100) and driving permits doubled to $30. Romney also proposed raising the firearms registration fee from $25 to $75. Despite howls from gun owners, the legislature joined in and raised the fee to $100 while extending the life of the license from four to six years.   Romney's proposal included a new $10 fee to acquire a state certificate of blindness and $15 for a photo identification card. The legislature removed that provision. The total revenue raised by Romney and the legislature remains a matter of debate. Romney's campaign says fees rose a total of $240 million in the 2004 fiscal budget; others, including the Cato Institute, put the figure around $500 million.  Another matter in the Romney revenue debate is the $350 million to $375 million he raised annually for three years by closing business tax loopholes. Romney has contended his move was not a tax increase.  Massachusetts business organizations had a different opinion at the time. So did his Republican rivals during the brutal primary season. Opinion: Romney shakes up the race Romney did benefit from a tax increase - a $1.1 billion tax hike passed by Democrats a year before he took office -- that helped cut the looming deficit.  On the other side of the coin, Romney's claim of 19 tax cuts during his term is a bit too self-generous by definition and scope since a number of ""cuts"" originated in the legislature. Among them, a one-year delay in a capital gains tax increase enacted before he took office, prescription drug and property tax relief for seniors, tax breaks for commuters and veterans, a business deduction for installing automatic sprinkler systems, extensions of temporary tax breaks and two ritual sales tax holidays for one weekend in August.  Working with the opposition In criticizing Obama's testy relationship with Republicans in Congress, Romney proudly noted his good times with Massachusetts Democratic legislators. ""I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together,"" Romney scolded the president. ""What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote."" Romney's situation was something of a mirror image. He was unable to push anything through that the Democratic leadership didn't like, including 800 vetoes Romney issued as governor. The legislature overrode all but a few vetoes issued when it was out of session. On Wednesday night Romney used his weekly meetings with the House speaker and Senate president as evidence of his ability to work with the other side. The meetings did happen, but not as a result of Romney's initiative. These weekly sessions have been a regular part of the Statehouse schedule going back at least to the administration of Michael Dukakis. They took place during the 12 years Republicans held the governorship before Romney took office and they continue today. Democratic lawmakers of the time recall Romney as a CEO type who dealt only with the legislative leadership. Even Tom Finneran, the former House speaker who went on to host a conservative talk radio show in Boston, recalls Romney as being imperious when he called legislative leaders in to discuss the budget crisis. ""Initially his sense was, `I have been elected governor, I am the CEO here, and you guys are the board of directors and you monitor the implementation of what I say,'"" Finneran told The Associated Press in August. ""That ruffled the feathers of legislators who see themselves as an equal branch (of government).""  Opinion: The audacity of Romney's Etch a Sketch Ironically, the single biggest bipartisan achievement during his administration was the state's health care reform law that requires all residents to buy health insurance -- i.e. the individual mandate of Obamacare. Legislators of that time give Romney high marks for working with them to get the law refined and passed.  The same lawmakers note, with pride, that the Romney-Democratic love fest resulted in legislation that was a model for Obamacare.  Welcome home, Mitt.

(Opinion) GOP haunted by John Boehner's fatal mistake?,"Before the final votes are counted in races that will determine the presidency and control of the US Senate, let us reflect on the single decision by the former Speaker of the House John Boehner that more than any other may have shaped the contours of this election. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is said to be a smart man, but he wasn't smart enough to see that by standing behind the GOP presidential nominee, a man Ryan says he's already voted for, he was doubling down on a colossal mistake made by his predecessor.  This mistake is among the reasons Hispanics may provide the decisive bloc of votes (the Hispanic vote is up by more than 100% in early voting in some states) that will put a Democrat back in the White House and hasten the civil war already brewing within the Republican Party. Just over two years ago, the US Senate passed what some described as ""the most monumental overhaul of US immigration law in generations"" on a bipartisan 68-32 vote.  It included more money for border security, which would have increased an already unprecedented level of personnel on the US-Mexican border, and an onerous 13-year path to citizenship that would have required the undocumented to jump through all sorts of hoops and pay back taxes. There was nothing like amnesty about it. Immigration advocates and experts embraced it the way many on the left greeted health care reform, accepting that it was a good start despite the flaws inherent in every legislative compromise. It was ushered through by a rising star in the Republican Party, Marco Rubio, who spent a considerable amount of his personal political capital by taking on the hard right of his party -- including advocating for the bill in such immigration hostile venues as the Rush Limbaugh show -- and (briefly) looked like the kind of 21st century leader the Republican Party would be eager to show off in the 2016 election cycle. President Barack Obama, who had spent years beefing up security forces along our much-discussed border with Mexico and keeping up a brisk pace of deportations to help make political space for an immigration compromise (similar to the tactics he used to end ""don't ask, don't tell""), was eager to sign that bill into law. But something happened that prevented Obama from completing another historic domestic legislative achievement. Then-Speaker Boehner balked, refusing to bring the bill to the floor in the House, where he knew that a majority of Republicans would vote against it, even though combined with Democratic support it could pass anyway. Boehner, a sensible politician, knew it was a sensible plan. He also knew that such a reform bill could either end the immigration headache that helped sink the GOP's 2012 nominee, Mitt ""Self-Deport"" Romney, or even broaden the party's base because Republicans could then credibly argue they were serious about the compassionate conservatism of George W. Bush. Not only that, they could go to struggling white and black voters and explain why such reform was good for them also.  Bringing the undocumented out of the shadows would have put upward pressure on wages at the bottom of the economic scale, which would have been good for the undocumented and American-born citizens struggling on the margins. There was a potentially enormous upside for the GOP, including launching Rubio into the 2016 presidential race as the ideal standard bearer for a party desperate to find a way to confront a demographic shift that threatens to turn it into a regional, no longer national force. Republican Party leaders were well aware of this and laid it out in painstaking detail in its 2012 autopsy. All they had to do was pull the trigger on a no-brainer piece of legislation. The Republican senators in now hotly contested races that they might lose saw the writing on the wall and advocated for the bill.  Instead of following their lead, or even his own conscience, Boehner sided with the most unreasonable factions of the GOP, the politicians who convinced their supporters it was possible, for instance, to repeal Obamacare while a guy named Obama was still in the White House. That decision, maybe like no other, helped usher in a 2016 GOP presidential nominee -- by legitimizing irrationality and bigotry and nativism -- who spent the primaries talking about building walls and a deportation force and thinking fondly of the ""Operation Wetback"" era but flipped to (sort of) embracing the bipartisan immigration reform bill Boehner unwisely passed on. Instead of the nomination of Rubio -- a candidate uniquely suited to help the Republican Party compete in a browning America: a young, talented, Hispanic with a compelling back story -- the party has the worst of all worlds.   It has a nominee who uses bigotry as a negotiation tactic, a base exposed as having no moral compass or set of principles it wouldn't sacrifice for him, and yet another speaker of the House who is saddled by an unmitigated political mess he might not be able to clean up after Tuesday because he chose to be led instead of leading. It will be fitting that the group of voters Boehner and Ryan decided was less important than party loyalty could be what finally forces a long overdue Republican reckoning."
Latinos left behind by Obamacare,"It wasn't until December 6 that Latinos could access CuidadoDeSalud.gov -- the extremely delayed and poorly translated Spanish version of HealthCare.gov. The thrown-together Spanish website has been a thorn in the President's side with the Latino community. It's no surprise that support for Obamacare has waned among Latinos. A Pew Research poll found that last year disapproval of Obamacare among Hispanics increased 11 points from September 2013 to December 2013.   The White House is worried. Not enough Americans are signing up for Democrats' misguided health care law. And that means more problems -- most notably higher costs -- could be on the horizon. So the administration is scrambling in the final three weeks of the enrollment period to sign up enough people to make the health care law work. Yet the White House is ignoring an inconvenient truth: Obamacare is hurting far too many of our friends and neighbors in the Latino community. The problems go far beyond the demeaning and sloppy cuidadodesalud.gov. One of the biggest fears the White House has is the low enrollment of millennials. Sixty-five percent of Latinos in this country are 22 to 35 years old, they are key to the success of Obamacare. If enough of them don't sign up for insurance plans, individuals may expect to face higher average costs.  But millennials say they aren't signing up because coverage is unaffordable -- or doesn't make sense for them.  Fusion, a new English-language Latino TV network, illustrated the trouble with the health care law when they interviewed a 28-year-old Obama supporter who says he won't sign up for coverage because ""he'd rather spend the money on his business, rather than spend it on insurance he says won't even help him that much."" Besides the affordability and enrollment problems for young people, our abuelos -- grandparents -- will be hurt by the new health care law as well. Due to Medicare reductions under Obamacare, Medicare Advantage is being cut. The National Medical Hispanic Association has called the payment cuts ""disturbing"" -- and rightfully so. Thirty-eight percent of Latinos with incomes of $20,000 or less enrolled in Medicare Advantage may face higher fees and fewer benefits. But the pain for our community doesn't end there. Across the country, Obamacare is bound to take a toll on some of the 2.3 million Hispanic-owned businesses and 1.9 million workers they help employ. The law has made it harder for businesses to hire more workers, and full-time workers have seen their hours reduced to part-time. Ruben Rivas, owner of a small business called H2Only Renewable Cleaning, told Telemundo, ""There is no way we can pay or provide employees their health insurance, because there is no margin. If I do that, I have to close the doors -- then no one is going to work. Unfortunately, we are trying to convert our employees from eight hours to 5.5 hours (daily) as stated in the new law."" Hispanics came to this country in search of the promise of individual freedom and opportunity, but Obamacare is undermining that promise. We do not need special sign-up programs or false assurances. We need real health care reform that actually expands access and lowers costs -- not ""reform"" that makes life more expensive.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Bill Clinton brings it for Obama,"The second night of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, featured speeches by Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States, as well as Elizabeth Warren, candidate for the U.S. Senate. The following contributors offered their assessments. Analysis: Clinton speech hit Obama's marks Alan Brinkley: Clinton was not only charismatic, but serious It has always been remarkable, I think, how Bill Clinton can bring a crowd alive, and that's what he did on Wednesday night. It was a speech full of wonky policy issues, the things he likes so well. But after so many months of paid advertisements playing ugly criticisms of the opposition, Clinton was not only charismatic, but serious.  For years now, conventions have been carefully organized for television without any real energy or excitement, one of the reasons that so few people are watching them anymore. But Clinton turned the convention into a real conversation about policy, about politics, and about the future.  His viewers might not agree with much of what he says, but his speech was still an event of the campaign. I wonder whether President Obama, who can give a pretty good speech himself, feels that Clinton has overtaken him. I wonder if Clinton's speech will lead to a more honest way of arguing about ideas and policy. I doubt it. But it might help at least some people to think about serious things. Alan Brinkley is the Allan Nevins professor of history at Columbia University.  John Avlon: Our most talented politician makes Obama's case Bill Clinton's speech reminded many Americans why he remains our country's most beloved and naturally talented politician, for all his faults.  On Wednesday night, he cut through the predictable partisan spin by making a credible and compelling case for Barack Obama's re-election -- better, frankly, than the president has made himself to date.  Full disclosure: I was a Clinton kid. I was a freshman in college in 1992, and Bubba's campaign inspired the sense that there was a third way, between the far right and far left, that could actually solve problems instead of simply demagoguing them. He was my sub-generation's JFK, and he inspired my unapologetic centrist politics. Bill Clinton can talk policy without putting anyone to sleep. That means communicating a love of ideas that can be put into action. And so in Wednesday night's speech he offered a seminar in how to contrast constructively; putting forward stats that resonate with common-sense values.   Case in point: Clinton's analysis of health care reform, and even the comparative deficit and debt plans, resonates on Main Street because he talks in terms of values and respects the intelligence of the American people. He surgically skewered the alternative Republican plans as well. In the process, he reminded us that good policy can be good politics, connecting with humor to the head and heart. Opinion: Bill Clinton, the reverse Clint Eastwood? Some of the unrelenting Clinton nostalgia from baby boomers stems from the fact that he reminds them of when they were younger than today, and possibly wealthier and more influential than they might be now. But the fact that Bill and Hillary Clinton are today apparently the most admired Democrats among Republicans -- who once made hating them a cottage industry, as they do with the Obamas today -- is ironic and sadly hilarious, a reminder of how shallow and unprincipled poisonous hyperpartisanship always ultimately is. If Bill Clinton were constitutionally eligible for another term, he would win. If swing voters all listened to Wednesday night's speech, I believe Barack Obama would win this election.  But Clinton's speech Wednesday night was both a seminar and a reminder of why we should love civic debates, as a matter of style and substance, focused on policy as well as politics. Write this line down: ""Democracy ... does not have to be a blood sport; it can be an honorable enterprise that advances the human interest."" Remember it and aspire to it, taking heart amid all the heat, to persevere in the belief that something at least a little bit better can always be within our reach.

Maria Cardona: Clinton answers the 'better off' question with resounding 'Yes!' President Clinton's speech, delivered in his unique, well, Clintonesque manner, crystallized the choice this election. He spelled out in the way only he can why Republicans seem to have a visceral reaction to President Obama and how that has kept them from putting the interests of the nation before their politics.  And he did it with emotion that was rational, passionate and pragmatic. He spoke directly to those disaffected swing voters who are disenchanted with the pace of the change they voted for in 2008, by explaining that it was not Obama who changed or who didn't work to deliver, it was the Republicans who kowtowed to their extreme wings and put the goal of defeating the president before any commitment to solving the big problems facing this nation.   He set the record straight on Medicare and on GOP fabrications about Obama's stance on welfare reform, and he unequivocally answered the question of whether we are better off today than when Obama took office: The answer was a resounding yes. Clinton's credibility and history with a similar economic situation (though Clinton said that no president could have fixed the damage Obama was handed in just four years) made him the right messenger to the right audience at the right time for Obama.  He delivered and he delivered big.   Other notable speeches? Elizabeth Warren, Cristina Saralegui -- the Latina Oprah Winfrey -- and of course Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown University law student smeared by Rush Limbaugh for speaking out for contraception coverage. They spoke to critical audiences within the Democratic Party: progressives who see Warren as a champion and crusader for consumer protection against a Wall Street run amok; progressive and independent women for whom Fluke embodies concern about politicians making decisions about their bodies, their families and their lives; and Latinos for whom Saralegui is an icon. She was introduced by a compelling ""Dreamer,"" Benita Veliz, underscoring the importance of immigration reform.  All three women spoke eloquently and from the heart about the only candidate in the race they said would fight for middle-class families, women, Latinos, Dreamers. One who would uphold the ideals of fairness, opportunity, hard work and compassion that reflect a country where everyone has the chance to achieve the American dream.  Maria Cardona is a Democratic strategist, a principal at the Dewey Square Group, a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton and former communications director for the Democratic National Committee. Gergen: Now it's up to Obama Ana Navarro: Sweet justice for the man from Hope, Arkansas On Wednesday night, Bill Clinton showed us what a political comeback looks like. In 2008, during the Democrat primary, he went from being the ""first black president"" to being accused of racism.  I know Bill Clinton, and when I saw him shortly after the election, he was deeply hurt. He thought Obama and the media had been terribly unfair to Hillary and to him.  Tonight, the man who was marginalized in 2008 came to the rescue of the man who marginalized him. And he did it in classic Clinton style: long, didactic, funny and very damn good.  I am a Republican, but I love a good political speech regardless of who gives it. Clinton was at the top of his game. He started with a bipartisan preamble, even giving credit to Presidents Bush 41 and 43. Then he went on to teach a master lesson on a partisan attack.  It says a lot about how Clinton is perceived and how Joe Biden is perceived that the former president got a night as the headliner all to his own, while the sitting vice president did not.  This night was sweet justice for the man from Hope, Arkansas. In 2000, Al Gore wanted to be his own man and couldn't keep Clinton far enough away. Today, Barack Obama wants to be Bill Clinton's heir and cannot keep him close enough. However, this does create a problem for Obama. He now needs to top Clinton's speech, and Bill set the bar quite high. Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and commentator, served as national Hispanic campaign chairwoman for John McCain in 2008 and national Hispanic co-chair for Jon Huntsman's 2012 campaign.   Ruben Navarrette: A great storyteller, but you have to read between the lines Bubba is back. And, from the sound of it, he never left.  Bill Clinton did Wednesday what he needed to do for Barack Obama. With a speech that was substantive and entertaining, the Democrats' Great Communicator energized the party's base. He laid out the narrative of the Obama presidency, better than anyone in this administration -- including the president himself -- has been able to do in the last three and a half years. He recited and refuted some of the more damning criticisms that Republicans lodged against Obama last week at their convention. And he assured the American people that he -- to continue a familiar theme from the Clinton years -- felt their pain and understood their worry over a fragile economy.  This being a Clinton speech, there were great lines. The former president pointed out that Obama had appointed to his cabinet people who had supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary. ""Heck,"" Clinton said, ""he even appointed Hillary.""  And this being a Clinton speech, there were also half-truths. For instance, you remember when GOP vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan was criticized by the left for blaming Obama for not acting on the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles plan for debt reduction, without revealing the little detail about how he himself didn't support it. Clinton called the Simpson-Bowles commission a ""balanced approach"" but didn't mention that Obama had failed to heed its recommendations. As someone who writes a lot about immigration, I heard one other line that jumped out at me: ""If you think the president was right to open the doors of American opportunity to young immigrants brought here as children who want to go to college or serve in the military,"" Clinton said, ""You should vote for Barack Obama."" He was referring to Obama's announcement several weeks ago that the Department of Homeland Security would take applications from young illegal immigrants who are interested in two years of temporary ""deferred action"" to keep them from being deported.

What really kills family values,"Seen from the perspective of 2012, the stunning Broadway revival of ""Death of a Salesman"" offers a powerful reminder that economic policy and family values go hand-in-hand.  Although many current politicians like to separate these two issues, the economic foundation of the family is central to its long-term health. 
In this classic play by Arthur Miller, premiered in 1949 to mesmerized audiences that had lived through the Great Depression, the protagonist is salesman Willy Loman, who is mentally broken down from his constant travel and struggle to make ends meet.  ""A small man can be just as exhausted as a great man,"" says Loman's wife, Linda. Loman's son Biff is unable to find a job and fulfill his father's hopes. Biff and his brother, Happy, are worried about their father's mental health, which is rapidly deteriorating. When Willy tries to find a job where he can stay in town to take better care of himself and his family, he ends up losing his job. The story disintegrates from there, culminating with Willy tragically committing suicide with the hope that Biff will use the life insurance money to start his own business.  Too often, politicians ignore the kinds of strains that economic problems cause for families. As the historian Matt Lassiter argued in an essay in ""Rightward Bound,"" a book I co-edited, the rhetoric about family values is rooted in conservative politics in the 1970s when political activists on the right and popular culture blamed sexuality and feminism, rather than unemployment and inflation, for problems at home.  The rhetoric from the 1970s has stuck. Many conservative Republicans such as former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum still define ""family values"" as having to do with matters of popular culture, abortion or sexuality. When the Republican primaries were still being actively contested, it was common to hear pundits argue that Mitt Romney represented the ""economic conservative"" in the contest and Santorum was the champion of ""family values."" Indeed Republicans often attack Democrats as having little interest in family values while many Democrats shy away from too much talk about the family for fear of looking as if they are trying to appease the right. But as Willy Loman's story makes clear, family values are as much about economics as culture.  Today, we're living with economic problems that have a direct correlation on our ability to nurture strong families. The first and most obvious is job growth.   The current sluggish recovery has left more than 8% of the work force without jobs, and millions of other Americans feeling that their futures are not secure.   When the men and women who run households don't feel that their jobs are stable, or they don't have jobs, tensions quickly mount over basic issues such as paying the rent or mortgage and buying food. According to a Rasmussen poll in 2011, 67% of Americans said that the economy was causing strains on their family. The second economic source of instability comes from taking care of the old. Many Americans are struggling to deal with the generational squeeze of taking care of their younger children while helping their elderly parents as well.  These pressures are greatly affected by the health of Social Security and Medicare, two programs that play a vital role for middle-class families. While these policies are often discussed as programs for the ""elderly,"" they have always been conceived as programs to help working families by providing them some relief from the basic costs faced by older members of their families.   In coming years, there will be a very big debate over the costs of these programs and the need for reform. It will be essential that policymakers in both parties do what is necessary to protect and strengthen the programs.  The third source of economic strain on the family comes from health care. Health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs have been a continually rising burden on family income that few people talk about.   If President Barack Obama's health care reform stands, then it will be essential that policymakers figure out how to make it successful. Central will be the need for the states to set up strong and functional health exchange systems and to make sure that the regulatory provisions in the bill are containing costs. If the program is deemed unconstitutional, policymakers in both parties need to go back to the drawing board to figure out how to improve the system.  Finally, there is education. Families are been run ragged by the challenges of higher education. The costs continue to rise even as income stagnates. Millions of Americans feel that the costs of higher education make college degrees impossible to earn. In this economy, a college education is vital to economic success.  Public policy most keep the interest rates on student loans at a reasonable level to make sure that families are not crushed by the pressures to finance college costs. The federal government must also make sure that states are financially healthy enough to support state colleges and universities. Americans who are in their 20s and 30s struggling to pay off massive college loans are at a major disadvantage when it comes to setting up their own households. This is one area where Obama and Mitt Romney seem to be in agreement, with both parties promising that they won't allow the rates on student loans to increase on July 1. During the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt always understood that family security could only result from economic security. This was a central theme of his presidency. As Roosevelt said upon signing Social Security in 1935: ""We have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age."" But over the past few decades, we've lost sight of Roosevelt's words.  It's time to rethink the notion of family values and remember, as the story of Willy Loman reminds us, that a strong family starts with a strong economy.

Obama: Clark Kent or Superman?,"What did you do over your summer vacation? If you're President Obama, you've had a bit of a transformation. That is, from the mild-mannered Clark Kent into, well, Superman. Or something like that. When we last left this story, President Obama was trying to be the measured adult in the room, compromising over the debt ceiling to get a deal. In the end, it wasn't the ""grand bargain"" that Obama wanted. Liberals argued that it was awful, too -- chastising the president for negotiating with himself. And Republicans complained that they needed more spending cuts. And, oh, by the way, they still wanted to repeal health care reform. In other words, an unsatisfactory experience for all. So when Obama came back to D.C. this fall, the feeling inside the White House was that something had to change. The bad news: Mr. Adult (aka Mr. Compromise) had sunk to new lows in the ratings. The good news: Congress had sunk even lower. Way lower. Then House Speaker John Boehner gave a speech outlining his demands for the deficit reduction ""supercommittee."" Top of the list: no new taxes.  Shocking, I know. That about did it. The White House figured it had no partner for peace. The man who had almost signed on to the grand bargain -- with some tax increases and entitlement cuts -- wasn't about to come back to the table anytime soon.  The next step: play the game. The president outlined his demand for the debt reduction supercommittee: no spending cuts for the middle class without commensurate tax increases on the wealthy. No proposals for long-term entitlement reform. But there was a catchy bumper sticker: the Buffett Rule. Billionaires should not pay a lower tax rate than the rest of us.  It's not intellectually satisfying. Nor does it improve the chances for a deal out of the supercommittee that can get anywhere in Congress. It's politics, plain and simple.   In fact, the strategy does one big thing: It reunites the president with the base of the Democratic Party, which finally had something to cheer. When Barack Obama came out swinging this week, threatening to veto any deficit reduction measure without a balance of new taxes and spending cuts, there was joy among liberals.  Obama had finally come home. For the rest of us, well, it was a dismal peek at reality. Who can really fault the White House for playing politics with Republicans who have refused to cut the big deals? After all, the GOP presidential candidates, by and large, are still complaining that Congress agreed to raise the debt ceiling. After Boehner lay down his laws, Obama had to do the same. He could no longer negotiate with himself. So he joined the game. Maybe it's the opening salvo, and maybe something will come of this kabuki. But there is a final calculation here: if nothing comes out of the supercommittee, the president would be less damaged than the Congress.   As for the rest of us, we're still Waiting for Superman. The real one."
What the Ted Cruz spectacle is all about,"This isn't the idealism of ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."" It isn't as dark as ""House of Cards,"" either.  So how about settling on something lighter, like say, ""Animal House,"" in which the dean famously says, ""The time has come for someone to put his foot down. And that foot is me."" And so it goes with Sen. Ted Cruz, at least when it comes to killing Obamacare. The first-term GOP Texan is the self-appointed executioner of a law Republicans despise. But truth be told, it's hard to figure out exactly what Cruz's faux filibuster on the Senate floor this week was really about. He's against big, bad Obamacare, we get it. Only he was asking Senate Republicans to vote against something that would actually kill Obamacare. Huh? Nevermind. None of this has been about reality. Rather, it's about cementing a new definition of leadership: Positioning yourself as the spokesman for your political base by telling it exactly what it wants to hear. In Cruz's case, it's the tea party base. Lucky for him, there's a made-for-TV bully pulpit,  plenty of time to talk and the talking points are easy and oh, so, predictable. Main Street fed up over Beltway shutdown battle Consider this sound bite extraordinaire: ""This is a fight to restore freedom to the people,"" says Cruz, clearly not inhibited by any lack of self-importance. ""This is a fight to get the Washington establishment, the empire, to listen to the people."" Not exactly Abraham Lincoln, but it's a whammy of a bite. In it, Cruz gets to cuddle the tea party while taking on the evil establishment — and by that he means the awful folks in his own party who would not shut down the government over a doomed move to kill Obamacare. Imagine that: Republicans refusing to catapult a man they don't like into the presidential arena. Maybe they're part of Cruz's evil establishment, but if they are, they're trying to save him — and the party — from itself on the issue of shutting down the government. Cruz is thinking 2016, but they're thinking about the repercussions for the GOP if the government shuts down.  While some polls show that two-thirds of tea party sympathizers are just fine with a shutdown over health care reform, a majority of independent voters are not. And last time I checked, those are the folks whom the GOP needs to win over if its going to win the White House. But I digress. Right now, Cruz has divided the Republican Party in a Palinesque way, only worse because he is an actual senator with actual authority who could have an actual presidential candidacy.  ""We have been beaten up by his so-called grassroots movement back home. They pound us with ads, we hear about what he wants at town halls. We don't like Obamacare, either. But there's another way to go about this,"" says a senior House Republican. ""He [Cruz] won one primary in a red state in a Republican year, and now he's busy running for president."" Oh, and by the way, he adds, ""he's all about raising money. And doing it at our expense."" Why is it at the GOP's expense? Because Republicans are now afraid of being challenged from the right in primaries. They're not worried about their Democratic opponents; they're worried about  the opponents on their right whom, many believe, Cruz would support and throw them under the bus. They're against Obamacare, but are they against it enough?  ""He's a demagogue-and-a-half,"" complains the House Republican. ""This is not what you do to your teammates."" Ah, but that's the crux of it all: Cruz doesn't need a team. He's got the floor to himself. And he's got the people, right?  That is, until he doesn't. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

"For Gabrielle Giffords, this is not an ending","Gabrielle Giffords submitted her resignation as a U.S. representative from Arizona before Congress on Wednesday,  and an initial reaction might be a sense of despair about her decision to step aside. Many have imposed a narrative of national recovery on Giffords' ability to run for her office again and take her oath in a clear strong voice. But in this case, it would be a mistake to confuse holding public office with redemption. A congressional seat is not supposed to be a plot point for Hollywood endings, and by passing up the chance to run again, Giffords has demonstrated a respect for the principles of representative democracy. The authors of the Constitution intended Congress to be a rotating body, free from the cults of personality and lifetime sinecures that characterized European governance. Although it is human nature to see a kind of triumph in being able to come back to one's job after an injury, Giffords understands that the office belonged not to her but to southern Arizona. She made the decision after a year of rehabilitation, and she deserved that time to make a hard call with the best evidence. Her choice this week recalls an old observation of Harry Truman, who said he always tried to remember that the crowds cheering and the bands playing ""Hail to the Chief"" were not for him personally. They were for the office of the presidency.   The office of Congress may also be too small for Giffords. This is a body that commands the respect of 8% of the electorate: a record low. And despite the illusion of glamour that surrounds it, the actual work can be physically taxing and spiritually dreary. Traveling back and forth from Washington each week, visiting the House floor multiple times a day for procedural votes, sweet-talking big donors, finding positions that will please the district without making you feel like a sellout -- all of these can take their toll. After her bruising re-election fight of 2010 -- one of the nastiest races in recent local memory, with an eerie pallor of violence hanging over it -- Giffords herself doubted whether she wanted the job much longer. She now has a golden opportunity to start a ""Gabrielle Giffords Institute"" for the study of gun violence or mental health care reform or solar energy or whatever public policy issue she wants to emphasize. Her moral authority and influence may be better used outside the halls of Congress, where she would have been inevitably fettered by the daily grind of politics and partisanship.  In her video announcement, she said: ""I will return, and we will work together for Arizona and this great country."" And we should take her at her word, even if that doesn't mean a return to elective office.  To be sure, this is not the future anyone would have wanted. There is enormous cruelty in her injury -- the robbery of her ability to speak -- which was one of her truly exceptional qualities. I remember thinking near the end of her first campaign for Congress, in 2006, that the only thing that could deny her a victory over her maladroit opponent would be some kind of epic goof made during a campaign rally or a debate -- a vague exclamation taken out of context or a damaging statement made in passion. But such a possibility was remote. ""Gabrielle doesn't really make mistakes,"" I told a friend. She possessed a preternaturally strong sense of control over her words. This was also true in private conversation. Giffords had that quality, cherished among leaders, to gauge the emotional temperature of the person she was with and adjust her own bearing accordingly. There were many times in our friendship when she managed to say the unexpectedly perfect thing in the moment: a key piece of advice, a joke, an anecdote that had precise relevance. There is a picture of her that is difficult for me to view. It is the last photograph of her taken before the 16 seconds of gunfire that would change everything. She is standing in front of the Safeway on January 8, 2011, looking intently at a middle-aged woman named Doris Tucker, who had been next in line to speak with her In back of her is the plate-glass front of the grocery store on which the smeary reflections of a few people are visible. Out of this crowd a gunman was about to emerge. But what dominates the frame is Giffords' expression, one of wordless concentration and interest in what Tucker was saying. It was a look that I knew well.  The loss of her ability to find the words in conversation easily is an awful blow. But the Giffords  I know won't surrender the primary motivating force in her life, which is the urge to make a difference in the public sphere and to use her talents to make life better for those around her. That was what motivated her first run for Congress five years ago. She is leaving national elective office in the same way she came in: with class and dignity. It would be a mistake to think of this as a defeat because it is not the neat Hollywood ending we had hoped for. This is not Hollywood. And this is not an ending.  Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

Why we're not prepared for a flu pandemic,"Just as Americans are staring down flu season, Hong Kong grabbed headlines this week with news confirming that a chicken was infected with the H5N1 virus and that many more suspected of harboring the dangerous disease were slaughtered.  In the recent movie ""Contagion"", Hollywood's version of a pandemic, the government successfully executes a response plan.  But our real-life encounter with a pandemic, the H1N1 flu, raises serious questions of whether the American public is prepared for such a crisis. It should have been good news that the H1N1 epidemic we confronted in 2009-10 was less deadly than feared, but instead, it was used as political leverage.  Conservatives, in particular, claimed the vaccination recommendations were overhyped, more ""big government"" meddling in citizens' lives.  What's worse, many media outlets highlighted the critical narrative while minimizing strong evidence that the government handled the threat quite well under the difficult circumstances.  This occurred as opinion polls revealed the public's growing lack of confidence in government officials and institutions, which are now at record levels  Is it any wonder, then, that, despite extensive planning and billions of dollars, the public will be unprepared for the next time?  The reason lies in our deep distrust of government and thus, our unwillingness to believe the experts' claim that vaccination is the single best method for preventing the spread of disease. To be sure, Americans have both historical and contemporary reasons for suspecting that government officials may not be diligent in protecting the public's health over powerful interests. The history of epidemics is replete with boneheaded government actions that trampled the rights of marginal populations in the interests of protecting the so-called larger public.  Nearly every major American epidemic has targeted the poor or an ethnic minority group as objects of blame in efforts to prevent the spread of disease. As late as the 2003 SARS outbreak, New Yorkers shunned the city's Chinatown amid rumors that undocumented immigrants had brought the disease to America.  By some estimates, business fell by 70% although not a single case from that neighborhood was ever diagnosed. In this media environment it is harder than ever for us to know who to trust and how to separate fact from fiction. During the H1N1 pandemic, radio personalities such as Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh implied that choosing not to take the vaccine was a litmus test of ideological commitment to opposing the Obama administration.  Some opponents of the administration's proposed health care reform legislation delighted in the vaccine production delays and questioned its safety and effectiveness, saying it was proof of the government's incompetence to ""run health care.""  Two senators commanded a news cycle by demanding  the secretary of Health and Human Services explain the shortage, joining the chorus of those accusing the government of wildly overestimating the production schedule and making false promises   Within two weeks of such grandstanding, there was a surplus of vaccine, although well over half of those questioned in polls said  they believed there was not enough vaccine for all who wanted it.  Too many are willing to accept, if not engage in, factual distortions to create their own comfortable reality. Public opinion polls around the time of the H1N1 danger revealed nearly a 20-point difference between Democrats' and Republicans' intention to seek the vaccine.  Republicans not only were less inclined to take it, they were also more inclined to doubt the disease was as serious as health officials claimed.  Our continued willingness to follow politicians who are leading us astray is to our own detriment. Admittedly, it takes considerably more effort to critically evaluate the accuracy of information we receive, especially if inconvenient, than to simply accept what we want to hear, but we have no other choice. Acting responsibly will literally be a matter of life and death.  In the end, fewer than 20% of Americans took the vaccine, with over half of the population indicating  they didn't believe the government message that the vaccine was safe and effective.   Ironically, Hollywood has now legitimated the public's skepticism by including a scene in ""Contagion"" in which a reporter asks the fictional CDC official how he knows the epidemic threat is not ""another false alarm"" like the H1N1.  Take it from me: H1N1 was not a false alarm, nor were the government recommendations to address it hyperbolic. In the uncertainty of a crisis environment, government officials provided effective leadership.  The distortions of politicians, ideologues and certain media outlets did us a disservice.  Fewer Americans than expected died or required hospitalization, but next time, we might not be so lucky. Ultimately, it's up to us to see through the politicizing and headline grabbing and protect ourselves. As Pogo observed, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."""
Republican Party goes round the bend,"In the beginning, one might have considered it bold -- even inventive -- to oppose every single thing President Obama supported.  But it quickly became tiresome and predictable over the last five years.  And now, as House Republicans weigh a resolution to sue President Obama for not quickly enough implementing a law the same Republicans voted more than 50 times to repeal or stall, all hell has broken loose.   Republicans are just being obnoxious now. And dangerous.  And nuts.  On Wednesday, the House Rules Committee will debate a draft resolution to file a lawsuit against President Obama, wasting taxpayer dollars in what is plainly a political stunt.   Their complaint?  That President Obama did not implement the employer mandate in Obamacare quickly enough.  That's right, that same employer mandate Republicans have berated Obama for, the one in the health care reform law they've voted 54 (failed) times to try to repeal or delay or stall -- the law, incidentally, that's working -- House Republicans are now using taxpayer money to sue President Obama for not implementing it quickly enough.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, at least Republicans aren't going full-political-stunt and impeaching President Obama ... yet.  Sarah Palin has thrown her constitutional-scholar-like support behind the idea.  Though as Attorney General Eric Holder said of Palin this weekend: ""She wasn't a particularly good vice presidential candidate. She's an even worse judge of who ought to be impeached and why.""   Republicans bash President Obama for issuing executive orders. But why should facts like the Constitution or how every president in history has used executive orders, and in most cases more than President Obama, stand in the way of a good partisan line of attack, let alone a political stunt?  Facts and proportionality certainly haven't been a barrier for Republicans so far.  For instance, also within the last week, conservative talk radio host Ben Shapiro said on Fox News that the Obama White House is a ""borderline Jew-hating administration.""   Republicans had long criticized the President as anti-Israel.  For instance, the Romney campaign ran a commercial criticizing Obama for not visiting Israel during the first three-and-a-half years of his presidency, and conservative pundit Mark Levin accused President Obama of ""hating Israel.""  But suggesting the White House and by, er, obvious implication President Obama, hates Jews is a whole new level of accusation. It's also a whole new level of crazy neglect of basic facts.   President Obama has increased security assistance to Israel every single year since taking office and Obama personally championed providing an additional $275 million over its standard foreign military financing aid in order to fund the construction of the so-called ""Iron Dome"" defense system.""  But facts, schmacts.  Republican smears against Obama are even more impervious than the Iron Dome.  No logic or reason can pierce their facade of BS.  Witness Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who last week called President Obama ""tone deaf"" for not visiting the border during his trip to Texas.  Texas Gov. Rick Perry also dinged the President along these lines: ""The President needs to come to the border, to see it himself.""  For his part, President Obama said, ""I'm not interested in photo ops, I'm interested in solving a problem.""  Which sounds almost like Obama is quoting Cornyn and Perry ... back in 2011.   Then, when pressing Congress to pass immigration reform, President Obama went to the border and ... Republicans criticized him for doing so.  ""What Sen. Cornyn is looking for, President Obama cannot deliver with another speech or photo op, and that's presidential leadership. Words matter little when there is no action,"" a Cornyn spokesperson said at the time.  Similarly, in 2011, Perry criticized Obama's trip to the border, ""I was very disheartened when the President came into El Paso a couple of weeks ago (and) had a photo-op."" In case you're not good at math, that's Republicans criticizing President Obama for doing something and then -- just three years later -- criticizing him for not doing the same thing.  Try as you might, there's just no way to rationalize the difference. Republicans damn President Obama he does it and damned if he doesn't.  But if you still believe in facts, here's something for you: Republicans crashed our nation's economy with their astronomical tax cuts, lax oversight of business and unfunded wars.   But instead of facing the truth and re-examining how their policies systematically harm our nation, Republicans just attack and blame President Obama.  They simply don't know what else to do.   That's not so say President Obama never does anything wrong or doesn't sometimes deserve blame.  Of course he does and we should have political checks and balances.   But while blaming and condemning President Obama has been Republicans' sole strategy since the moment he was elected, they've taken that crazy irresponsibility to the next level -- including suing the President of the United States of America for doing his job and carefully implementing laws, even the ones Republicans hate.  That's what all presidents do.  Meanwhile, Congress is supposed to work with the President and pass laws.  Republicans are the ones who aren't doing their jobs.  They're too busy spending our money on their partisan revenge stunts and inventing new outlandish attacks against Obama to distract the American people from the giant mess the Republican Party has caused -- and not only are they not doing anything to fix it, they have no solutions.   The more irrational and hypocritical the Republican attacks get, the more they're desperately trying to hide this simple truth.

"Duped on Iraq War, has press learned?","In February 2002, when the Bush administration's campaign to  win support for invading  Iraq was gathering steam, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was asked at a news conference about insinuations that Saddam Hussein was in cahoots with al Qaeda,  a collaboration for which there was no evidence.  Rumsfeld's response may not have been illuminating, but it was certainly memorable. ""Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me,"" he said, ""because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we don't know we don't know."" As we approach the 10th anniversary of that invasion, Rumsfeld's musings provide a helpful reminder for members of the news media. When the next war debate comes, our first step ought to be to take careful stock of what we know and what we don't.  Journalists regularly have to take crash courses in new subjects. When the economy imploded in 2008, many of us who write about public affairs found ourselves addressing economic matters in greater detail than ever before. To write intelligently about health care reform in 2009, you had to get up to speed on how things such as the health insurance market and Medicare work, and a hundred other details.  When a new topic is inherently opaque -- such as the internal politics of a country most journalists could barely find on a map, or the complex consequences of starting a war in a region where U.S. foreign policy is widely reviled -- we should know more than ever about our own personal known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Opinion: Did Iraq War give birth to the Arab Spring? That didn't happen in 2002 and 2003. The campaign to sell the Iraq War was a carefully planned and skillfully executed propaganda effort, and it succeeded because so many journalists and news outlets went along for the ride. To be fair to the news media, they were up against an administration using diabolically clever techniques. To take just one example, in the fall of 2002, the administration leaked a story to The New York Times' Judith Miller claiming that Iraq had purchased aluminum tubes clearly intended for use in centrifuges to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons.  The truth, as we later found out, was that there was no Iraqi nuclear program, and the tubes in question would have been virtually useless for one. They were meant for conventional rockets. But the administration knew the exclusive would be too juicy for Miller to pass up. Her credulous account, passing all the administration's false claims on as a ""scoop,"" appeared on the Times front page on September 8.  Vice President Dick Cheney then went on ""Meet the Press"" that very day and said, ""It's now public that in fact he has been seeking to acquire, and we have been able to intercept and prevent him from acquiring, through this particular channel, the kinds of tubes that are necessary to build a centrifuge."" So the administration planted a false story in the Times, then cited the false story on NBC, using the Times' imprimatur to bolster its credibility. That is some Jedi-level media manipulation. Hans Blix: Why invading Iraq was a terrible mistake Every major news organization, from national newspapers to television networks to magazines, was complicit to some degree in selling the public a brief of false information, from Hussein's allegedly terrifying arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to the fictional links between the Iraqi government and al Qaeda.  It wasn't that you couldn't find journalists questioning the official story, raising doubts about the administration's claims, and doing the hard work to determine what the truth was. You always can. Whenever there's a story that the media as a whole get wrong, there's always a reporter somewhere who got it right. The problem was that those voices were so much quieter, pushed so far to the edge of the national debate. Even within some publications there was a tension. One of the journalistic heroes of the pre-war period was Washington Post national security reporter Walter Pincus, who reported the lack of evidence for the administration's hype. But his articles were buried deep within the paper, while the front page blared scary stories about the fearsome threat from Iraq and the Post's editorial page beat the drums for war. Asked later why his stories were shunted to the back pages, Pincus responded, ""The Post was scared."" Opinion: Why the war in Iraq was fought for Big Oil And so were much of the media. When there's a war in the offing, the flags are waving and dissenters are being called treasonous, the media's courage tends to slip away. Which is particularly regrettable, since the time when the government is pressing for war should be the time when they are more aggressive than ever, exploring every possibility and asking every question, over and over again if need be. That's the time when government is most likely to dissemble and deceive. That was when we most needed the press, and when its failure was the most costly. So the next time people in power propose a new war -- and they will -- journalists need to ask some important questions. What are the limits of our understanding of this country we might invade? What are the motivations of the people pushing for the action? What evidence is the government offering to support its claims? Are there knowledgeable people who disagree, and what are they saying? Which of the government's claims have I investigated myself, and which am I taking on face value? What are the potential consequences of military action, good and bad, and have I explored them in enough detail? And in the context of Iraq, which questions do I wish I had asked last time around? That's just a start, of course. Perhaps lessons have been learned, and the next time a president warns the American people that we have no choice but to invade another country or risk our doom, the press will do a better job of being skeptical, thoughtful and rigorous than it did 10 years ago. It couldn't do much worse. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Why Trump is still winning,"This is the real battle going on in DC today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. With a tax plan inching forward in stops and starts, Roy Moore's numbers, in his US Senate run in Alabama, rising (the President has now even endorsed him), and liberal eminences in politics and media facing sexual allegations that may be worse than those made against Trump, the anti- and never-Trump forces are in a worse state of incredulity than before.   How can this guy still be chief executive -- and even winning?  At first their surprise might seem sensible: A few weeks ago, things looked bad for Trump. Health care reform was stalled, Roy Moore was behind, and the Virginia results foreshadowed a Democratic Senate to come. The time has been out of joint for long enough, Trump's critics believed, and the correction was finally happening. Indeed, we saw another setback on Friday, with Michael Flynn pleading guilty to lying to the FBI, and fingers now pointing at Jared Kushner. But after all the other controversies that have happened and haven't much damaged Trump himself, people can't help but see this one as another sign of corruption that just won't stick. Just hours later, the Senate passed the tax bill.  And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump's way.   This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don't mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality, and victimhood. In the Chronicle of Higher Education last week, Brittney Cooper, a professor at Rutgers had this critique about the legacy of Galileo, Newton, Pasteur, and Einstein: ""The history of Western thought and science is predicated on the argument that African and indigenous peoples are inferior races.""  That's right -- all those inventions and discoveries that we honor and the geniuses we remember had a racist underside, by her lights. Elsewhere in the article she wrote, ""No questions have ever been off-limits for white scholars,"" a statement that would surprise every white scholar I've ever known. People who still can't assimilate the ascent of Trump need to pay closer attention to these accusations. They're not uncommon. Sensible liberals shrug them off as, well, kind of true but not really significant to health care, the environment, reproductive rights, and other progressive planks.  But people who voted for Trump have become especially attuned to such charges, and it only takes a quick playback by Rush Limbaugh or Tucker Carlson of the day's denunciation of America, white males, or the West by Professor X, Opinionator Y, or Celebrity Z to stoke their sense that the intellectuals loathe them. The more the accusers talk, the more rock hard Trump's base becomes. The remarkable thing is how many Republican leaders still haven't figured this out. After Trump dropped his Pocahontas remark at the meeting with Navajo veterans, Sen. John McCain berated him for ""politicizing these genuine heroes.""  Never mind that leftists have relentlessly politicized every demographic group in the country. Trump voters feel that by invoking her make-believe American Indian heritage, Sen. Elizabeth Warren played on those very identity politics to advance her career and mark her as more worthy of an elite job than any old white man. Last week, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged a pending ethics probe of Roy Moore should he win the election and take his seat, Laura Ingraham had to remind him of what that would say to Alabama voters. He came off as believing that the will of the people is one thing, but the will of the Senate is another. The culture wars and Twitter spats that Trump has fought have delighted his fans but cornered senators, who may be realizing that the opinion of the Great Unwashed is more important than the opinion of, say, The New York Times -- more important, that is, to their job security.   When you sit at the top with an office in the Capitol and people lining up to tell you how wonderful you are, an academic on MSNBC going on about white privilege, toxic masculinity, and cisgender bias doesn't bother you.  Nor does a school board that approves opposite-sex bathroom privileges for transgender students and casts concerned parents as ""phobic.""  But if you're a small businessman or blue-collar worker worried about cost of living and with children to feed and educate, and who thinks little about identity issues, those charges grate on your nerves. Trump is your champion, not the lords in Congress. If Republicans don't follow his lead, more of them will share the fate of Sen. Jeff Flake, whose political career the President has called ""toast."""
Why our health care system is broken,"Is health care in America getting safer? This is a question that we all think about as doctors and patients. The answer seems to be not really.       A new report found that hospitals have been gaming the system to make their re-admission numbers look good by putting patients who return in a special observation area instead of counting them as readmission. Independently, another report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality shows that nationwide reductions in patient complications have plateaued. Furthermore, part of the reductions was due to creative ways that hospitals code or report complications. Many of us who take care of patients know that health care continues to struggle with endemic variations in quality stemming from poor coordination, misdiagnoses and inappropriate care. While state-of-the-art care is there, delivering it can be messy. There certainly have been real success stories in pockets of health care. I've seen some of them. But they occur among the 1% of patients in America who have their outcome tracked. For 99% of patients, the outcome of the surgery or treatment is never tracked.   The only reason a small percentage of patients even get their results tracked is because a few doctor groups have had the vision to disrupt medicine's black box. Already, open heart and transplant procedures have seen improvements with data transparency.  But most patients go home after treatment with no tracking of result. Moreover, data extracted from crude medical bills capture only a small fraction of the overall harm in health care.  Mediocre metrics sometimes ignore the patient and focus on parameters that make us feel good that we are measuring quality, sort of like a pill that lowers a cholesterol number on a lab test, but doesn't actually extend the life of the patient.  The things that matter for patients — a doctor's skill and sound judgment, and staff teamwork — are unmeasured by the business stakeholders in health care.   As a country, we've chosen to spend billions on medical technology and new drugs, but we've been cheap when it comes to measuring performance accurately and fairly. As a consequence, the field of health care has focused on what's easy to measure, rather than things that are important to patients.   For example, we measure knee surgery readmission rates using billing data but not a patient's ability to walk three months later. We measure patient satisfaction, but not the appropriateness of medical care.   Moreover, there is one metric that tells you more about hospital quality than anything Medicare tracks. It's the culture. Culture is the teamwork that is essential in delivering safe medical care.   Using a validated survey of hospital employees, my research colleagues and I at Johns Hopkins in partnership with Duke University and the Minnesota Hospital Association conducted a study of hospital safety and teamwork culture and patient outcomes. Specifically, the survey asked a hospital's doctors, nurses and other staff if they feel comfortable speaking up when they have a safety concern, if communication breakdowns are common, and if management is responsive to their needs.  The study, published recently in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons, found what many doctors and nurses have long known to be true, that a hospital's culture is a powerful factor in a patient's surgical outcome.  When hospital employees feel that patient care is well-coordinated and their ideas are valued, patients receive safer care. Conversely, when the teamwork is poor and management is distant, bad things are more likely to happen. In medical organizations around the country, increasingly, doctors describe working within one of two types of organizational cultures. One where staff are happy, turnover rates are low, and clinicians feel a sense of ownership over the entire delivery of care.   The other is a workplace where doctors believe they know how to make care safer, but feel their management is out-of-touch. As corporate medicine and new technology threaten to depersonalize the doctor-patient relationship, a serious risk to our nation's health care system is an organizational culture that takes a back seat to the frenzy to collect data to look good on regulatory requirements.  Without meaningful metrics of hospital culture and patient outcomes, we are all flying blind. Health care reform becomes a discussion about how to finance the broken system, not how to fix it.  Creating a great and affordable health care system should begin with supporting the work of doctor groups and patient registries to create ways to measure outcomes accurately and fairly. We should be cautious in celebrating health care's triumphs as long as medical error is the third leading cause of death in the United States and some patients tell us they can't afford the surgery we offer them. Traditional studies in medicine have asked whether there is an incremental benefit associated with a new medication and surgical technique, but we could do more to evaluate the benefit of the nontechnical (behavioral) skills that result in great medical care.   Improving patient safety and quality is an endeavor that requires both human factors and an organizational approach. An organization's culture also influences our professional fulfillment and workplace happiness at a time when outside burdens are piling on. Improving hospital culture has implications for the important problem of burnout in the medical profession, a well-known safety issue that affect patients.   Health care harm is common, real and costly. As scholars of health care work to improve measurement of health care quality, we should remember that when physicians are looking for medical care, we do not look up a hospital's readmission rate -- we go to a place with a great culture.

Mitt Romney vs. stubborn facts,"John Adams once said, ""facts are stubborn things."" These days, another Massachusetts politician has found that saying to ring especially true.  While it's still unclear how Mitt Romney can be the CEO, chairman, president and sole shareholder of Bain Capital, a company that he claims no responsibility for, it's become increasingly evident that candidate Romney simply doesn't want to talk about the facts of his business record.  In an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Romney suggested that to question his experiences is to ""attack success."" If this is the case, and if we're also not supposed to talk above a whisper about Mitt's record as governor, including his signature accomplishment in health care reform, then which parts of his biography remain on the table?  Romney clearly prefers his largely undisclosed experiences in the private sector over his publicly poor record in Boston. At every turn, Romney and his campaign have attempted to steer the discussion toward business matters for just this reason. John King: Why is 1999 so important in 2012? But when the Washington Post took him up on it last month and published an article headlined ""Romney's Bain Capital invested in companies that moved jobs overseas,"" the Romney campaign was caught flatfooted. The Post found that Bain Capital, the firm Romney spent much of his professional life building up, had invested in companies that had not only shipped jobs overseas -- a practice of some concern to working- and middle-class Americans -- but had pioneered the practice. Romney's campaign pushed back hard, claiming that the Post had its facts wrong. The campaign met with the Post's editors and demanded a retraction, claiming that Romney had left Bain in 1999, supposedly before the outsourcing investment began. The Washington Post listened to the Romney side of the story but stood its ground.  Now we know why. The Boston Globe reported two weeks ago that Romney had signed official documents claiming to be the president and CEO of Bain Capital as late as 2002, when the company was actively building up firms that outsourced American jobs. He didn't just say this casually at some dinner party; he swore it was the truth on Securities and Exchange Commission filings.  What did the Romney campaign do this time? It hit the ""repeat"" button and demanded a retraction from the Globe. Who are you going to believe, the campaign asked its hometown paper, me or your lying eyes? Once again, the investigative journalists stood by their reporting. Since the Globe story, the hits have kept coming. The AP reported this week that Romney stayed in ""regular contact"" with Bain during his so-called absence, ""personally signing or approving a series of corporate and legal documents through the spring of 2001."" Several sources are now saying that Romney made repeated trips to Boston to meet with Bain executives during this period, even though he recently told CBS's Jan Crawford that he doesn't ""recall even coming back once to go to a Bain or a management meeting"" during the period in question.  So despite what the Romney campaign claims, media interest in this story has nothing to do with attacking personal success in the private sector. It has nothing to do with avoiding the real issues of the campaign.  It has everything to do with attempting to get to the bottom of a situation in which what a candidate is saying seems to have come unglued from the stubborn facts. Opinion: Why won't Romney release more tax returns? Americans know that a level playing field empowers a successful economy. You want to talk about soaking the rich? Mitt Romney's father, George Romney, paid an effective tax rate of nearly 37% in 1967. The elder Romney didn't complain and released his tax returns to prove his compliance with the law of the land he wanted to lead. In 2010, Mitt Romney's tax rate bobbed and weaved its way below 15% -- and we know that only because the public had to pry his return (he has released only a full one) out of his clenched hands. Even more fascinating than the fact that Romney's father released 12 years' worth when he ran for president in 1968 is the reason why. ""One year could be a fluke,"" the elder Romney said, ""perhaps done for show."" This country has a noble habit of withholding elected office from people who have trouble with the facts. Romney could end these discussions overnight by releasing his tax returns, as he has been called on to do by Republicans like Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. Until he makes peace with the facts, Romney will be stuck at the intersection of what is both a character issue and a policy issue. If Romney won't stand by his record at Bain, just like he won't stand by his record as governor of Massachusetts, how exactly is the American public supposed to evaluate the candidate? And if he won't disclose his own relationship with tax loopholes and offshore tax havens, leaving voters more questions than answers, how can the American people trust him to reform our tax code in a way that closes loopholes, eliminates free-riding and ensures that everyone is playing by the same rules? Facts and the Romney campaign have a difficult relationship these days. But they do share one thing in common: They're both stubborn.

David Axelrod: Orrin Hatch's simple act of kindness,"In March 2010, during my second year as senior adviser to President Barack Obama, I was the subject of a snarky newspaper profile, portraying me as tired and defeated in the midst of the final push for health care reform. I was not the first or last presidential aide to find himself in such crosshairs and, as a highly visible member of the administration, I knew such stories were to be expected.  Still, I was working night and day to advance the President's agenda, so it was particularly irritating to see quotes from well-meaning friends and even family members lending credence to the story by sharing their concerns about my stamina. I was traveling the day the piece hit when an unexpected call lit up my cellphone just as I was settling into my seat for a flight back to Washington. It was from Sen. Orrin Hatch. ""I saw that story in the paper this morning,"" he said, ""and I just wanted to call and say, don't let the bastards get you down."" I had known Hatch a little through my wife, Susan, and her work as founder of CURE, an organization she helped create to fight for more medical research into epilepsy. Hatch was in the audience when Susan spoke at an event in Salt Lake City about the toll epilepsy had exacted on our daughter, Lauren. Moved by the story, the senator invited Susan to visit with him in Washington and became a great supporter of epilepsy research. Though solidly conservative, Hatch had famously found common cause with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy on children's health care and other issues. I was in the audience when he had spoken movingly about those collaborations at Kennedy's memorial service in 2009.  By the time of Hatch's call to me, however, partisanship had boiled over, which made his simple act of kindness all the more meaningful. After four decades in Washington, Hatch was accustomed to the cruel rituals of Washington. He had seen a parade of presidential advisers held up to intense and sometimes very personal criticism when administrations appeared to be stumbling, as all administrations do. As he cheerfully imparted with his call, this is one of the rites of passage of public service. They come and go.  Hatch, 83, who Tuesday announced plans to retire at the end of his current term, has himself been the target of some harsh criticism, most recently over his fulsome praise for President Donald Trump at the White House ceremony before Christmas marking the passage of the tax bill. (Wherever you stand on the 45th president or the tax bill, it seemed more than a little hyperbolic to suggest, as Hatch appeared to, that Trump is on track to eclipse Washington or Lincoln as our greatest president.)  That bit of fawning came amid Trump's own aggressive wooing of Hatch to run for re-election this year, an effort that seemed to ramp up instantly with news that Mitt Romney is waiting in the wings to succeed Hatch as senator from Utah. Having chased out a number of Republican apostates, such as Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, Trump surely is less than eager to welcome one of his harshest critics to the Republican caucus in the Senate. With Tuesday's announcement, Hatch yielded to the realities of age, poor poll numbers and, just maybe, a desire to leave on his own terms and not as a convenient tool of this President. It also means the Senate will lose yet another of the dwindling corps of members who recall a time when bipartisanship was possible and simple acts of civility were not considered a sign of weakness or treachery. Thanks for the call, Senator — and for your service to the country."
Donald Trump isn't learning from his mistakes,"As they brace for harsh media attacks on their first 100 days, President Donald Trump's team points out with justification that other presidents have stumbled, too. John Kennedy had a disaster with the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. Bill Clinton slipped and fell in a controversy over gay people in the military. The George W. Bush team failed to pay sufficient attention to intelligence warning of terrorists hijacking airplanes.  As Richard Neustadt argued in a seminal book on presidential power, a new White House team must make some of their biggest decisions early on -- at a time when they are least experienced -- and mistakes happen.     Even so, events of the past few days underscore a sharp and potentially dangerous difference between the Trump administration and several of its predecessors: most others -- Kennedy and Clinton in particular -- were learning organizations that got much better on the job as they went.   By contrast, the performance of the Trump team suggests that its learning curve is a lot flatter than it should be. To be fair, there have been some encouraging signs of improvement, especially in international affairs where the arrival of Gen. H.R. McMaster as national security adviser has brought a crisper decision-making and execution process. Even that, however, is not what it should be: the recent snafus over the whereabouts of an aircraft carrier group were surely embarrassing to a professional like McMaster. And the world is still scratching its head over what strategy and leadership role Trump is pursuing globally. By this time in his presidency, there should be a sense that he and his team have a firm grip on governance. But on matters big and small, the administration in recent days has revealed that it is making many of the same kind of mistakes it made a few months ago: Secrecy From the beginning, an administration that promised transparency has engaged in excessive secrecy, feeding a narrative that it is trying to hide things. Why then would it put a new lid on its visitor logs? Why haven't they learned that doubling down may feel macho but it further erodes public trust. New plan on health care? From the beginning, there have also been worries in the press and public that the President is a con man, selling something that isn't what it seems. This isn't good for him or the country. Why then has the administration latched onto the new plan for health care reform coming out of the House Republicans?  Under the plan, according to preliminary reports, the federal government would continue to provide many of the supports of Obamacare -- but would give states the right to strip them away. How can the sick and elderly rely upon such a scheme?  Many of them will think it is a con job. Taxing question Similarly, Trump's Treasury Secretary and his top economic adviser in the White House have said in recent days that instead of paying for big tax cuts the old fashioned way -- by cutting spending or raising other taxes -- the White House may instead assume much faster economic growth, bringing in much more revenue.   Most mainstream economists are deeply skeptical that such big tax cuts will automatically produce dramatic gains in growth; indeed, the markets in recent days are suggesting that the economy -- initially boosted by Trump -- is already sliding back toward sub-normal growth. How long will it take before Democrats target Trump tax cuts as another con job benefiting him and his friends? Disorder in the White House? Even as polls show that Trump is holding onto his base support, they also show that the general public is tiring of his hype and wild gyrations. A more orderly White House is obviously needed. Why then, in recent days, has Trump insisted that Congress not only avert a government shutdown this coming week but also pass the health care bill in the House -- something no one on the Hill expects to happen?   Why in the world did Trump also surprise his Treasury Department by proclaiming that by Wednesday or shortly after, he will propose his tax plan? His own team is skeptical. Sorry folks, this isn't the way an orderly White House works.  Hosting Ted Nugent? His White House staff has rightly said that time is a premium asset for the President. It may seem petty to raise the question of why then he reportedly still gives short shrift to national security briefings but this past week gave four hours to serving dinner and a guided tour to Sarah Palin, Kid Rock and Ted Nugent, the latter a notorious racist who has called for the hanging of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and called Obama a ""subhuman mongrel.""   White House advisers could well dismiss all this as so much cavil. Look, they could rightly say, he isn't tweeting quite so much and for the most part, his tweets have been less sulfurous. Yes, that's true -- and thank goodness -- but it is also missing the bigger point: that in so many ways, things haven't really improved that much.    The secrecy, the deception, the hype, the internal struggles, the slow-moving appointments process, the sliming of opponents, the lack of strategy, on and on -- all are pretty much the same.   Other recent presidents have shown how important it is to learn and grow in office. After mishandling the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy bore down and a year and a half later was a magnificent leader in the Cuban missile crisis, averting a near nuclear war. Clinton pulled himself together after his early mistakes and became a much crisper, more effective president. With time, determination and self-reflection, Barack Obama became a much better president.   Not just for their sake but for the country's, it is important that Trump and his team now seize upon this 100-day landmark, stop being so defensive, and quietly learn from these early months how to govern effectively. History shows that it can be done."
Cuts will take food off the table for 47 million Americans,"In the last few weeks, the media has been ablaze with news of the government shutdown, the debt limit and health care reform. Missing from most public debate, however, is the cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits that will take place on November 1 and will affect every one of the more than 47 million Americans who depend on the program to help meet their basic nutritional needs.   When the changes are implemented, everyone enrolled in the SNAP program will see their benefits cut. For example, a family of four that qualifies for the maximum monthly benefit will lose $36 a month -- that's a 5% reduction. While this may not seem like a lot, I speak from experience when I say $36 provides much more than you might think. This past September, I participated in the SNAP challenge.  For a week, I stuck to a budget of about $1.50 per meal, the average SNAP benefit for one person. It was a tough week. I found myself drained and constantly thinking of food.  When the SNAP cuts take effect next week, benefits will average about $1.40 per meal. I can't imagine the strain this will place on struggling families who are counting every penny and trying to stretch their benefits.  Eatocracy: The food stamp challenge Most families do not have enough to make it through the month already -- 90% of SNAP benefits are redeemed by the third week of the month and 58% of food bank clients currently receiving SNAP turn to food banks for help at least six months out of the year.  The upcoming cuts will result in an increased need for food assistance at food pantries and soup kitchens across the nation when many are already stretched meeting sustained high need in the wake of the recession.  At Feeding America, we're doing everything we can to prepare our network of food banks for the increased demand, but charity alone cannot make up for the impending $5 billion loss in SNAP funding. The reduced funding will result in the loss of nearly 1.9 billion meals in the next year. That's more than half of Feeding America's total projected output for 2014. The cuts this week are significant and will put a strain on millions of families struggling with food insecurity, hitting them right before the holiday season. Adding to this is the fact that Congress is considering much deeper cuts to SNAP benefits and eligibility restrictions that will affect millions of low-income people as part of the farm bill.  In September, the House passed legislation cutting $40 billion in SNAP over the next 10 years, according to a Feeding America analysis. Together with this week's cuts, the pending legislation will result in a loss of nearly 3.4 billion meals for low-income Americans in 2014 alone, according to a Feeding America analysis. These are meals our most vulnerable citizens cannot afford to lose, and food banks and other charities simply cannot fill that gap. While we cannot stop this week's SNAP cuts, we can prevent further cuts from taking place. Call your member of Congress and tell them not to cut SNAP.  Helping our neighbors in need is a fundamental American value, and fighting hunger is a public-private partnership. We need a strong charitable system and a strong federal anti-hunger safety net. Working together, individuals, charities, business and government can solve hunger.  Do your part to make sure no one in America goes hungry.   Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Obama was too timid on health care,"The individual mandate might prove to be the death knell for President Barack Obama's health care reform.  Politically, the polls have been clear. While most parts of the Affordable Care Act are immensely popular with the public, as recent data from the Kaiser Foundation has shown, the individual mandate is unpopular. (A CNN poll found that a bare majority of Americans oppose the mandate to buy health insurance.) The Supreme Court heard arguments last week over whether the mandate is constitutional, and the administration is now waiting to see if the court will dismantle this key part of the program -- or possibly throw out the entire health care law. Although the individual mandate was born out of conservative proposals in the 1990s -- an effort to lower costs by requiring people to buy into the private market rather than creating a government program -- the presence of the mandate is also a product of the timidity liberals have displayed about their ideas since the 1990s.  As Princeton sociologist Paul Starr has written in the New Republic, during the 1990s the mandate was perceived as the ""conservative alternative to the Democrats' proposed mandate on employers to pay for a share of health insurance. The Republican proposal was thought to represent a more individualistic, market-friendly approach.""  Whereas liberals were once willing to defend the role of the federal government in American life and, even more importantly, defend the costs that federal programs imposed on the citizenry, liberals since the Age of Clinton have relied on developing jerry-built solutions to domestic programs that are often unpalatable politically -- and don't accomplish their goals. For much of the 20th century, liberals argued that government was an essential part of national life and that Americans would have to live up to certain obligations to support social programs that came with the privileges of citizenry. During the New Deal, President Franklin Roosevelt was not bashful about defending the value of government. In 1935, for instance, Congress passed the Social Security Act in which the federal government  took over the role of providing old age insurance to the elderly.  To finance the benefits, Roosevelt and Congress created a payroll tax paid by workers and businesses. During World War II, as government spending skyrocketed as a result of defense needs, the Roosevelt administration supported a massive expansion of the income tax.   When the war started, only 4 million people paid income taxes. When the war ended, 44 million people were paying and taxes were withheld directly from paychecks.  The Treasury conducted a public relations campaign to sell the tax to Americans that emphasized that these were ""Taxes to beat the Axis."" At the movies, Americans saw short films where a voice explained to Donald Duck just how his money was being used (and how he could take as exemptions Huey, Louie, and Dewey). This liberal ethic flourished for decades, even as liberals remained leery of the power of conservatism and aware of the long tradition of resistance to government in America.  During the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson, who avoided proposing any tax increases until 1967, did talk to citizens about how a wealthy nation could afford to pay for programs that dealt with issues such as poverty and urban decay.  With civil and voting rights, he called on the government to do what the private sector would not do on its own. On health care, Johnson and Congress created Medicare, which provided for a government takeover of  the insurance costs of hospital stays for the elderly, funded through higher payroll taxes.   When Ted Kennedy championed health care, his vision was still very much akin to the ""single- payer"" model of other countries where the government would be the insurer of first resort. But during the 1980s, after Ronald Reagan entered the White House and the modern conservative era began, liberals retreated into a defensive stance.  After Democratic candidate Walter Mondale suffered at the polls in the 1984 campaign when he admitted that he would call for higher taxes, most Democrats were resistant to proposing any kind of revenue increase. The shift could be seen with health care.  When President Bill Clinton proposed health care reform in 1993, he avoided the single-payer model that had been favored by older liberals like Kennedy for decades and instead opted for a complex system that aimed to create new mechanisms for offering and purchasing health insurance and stronger regulations to lower costs.  The complexity of Clinton's plan, which involved an employer mandate, left his program vulnerable to attack from Republicans who characterized it as a Frankenstein monster that would result in massive deficits. Obama fell into a similar trap with health care. Although he was more open than many of his predecessors to championing an active government, he acted from a defensive posture. His health care proposal was even less ambitious than that of Clinton. He essentially chose a path that regulated the existing system and required all Americans to be part of it.  Obama was not enthusiastic about any kind of single-payer option to compete with private markets and he allowed Congress to drop the public option that would create an alternative to private insurance.  The result was an extraordinarily complex system, which depended on a mandate requiring the purchase of private insurance to make sure that costs were covered. The government intervention was indirect; the financing mechanisms were murky. It is not surprising that the individual mandate has caused so many problems. At its core, the mandate constitutes a conservative solution to the problem of costs and part of an effort by liberals to ensure health care coverage without resorting to the kinds of government interventions that liberals once championed.  Obama ultimately promoted the health care bill as a cost-cutting measure that would create greater efficiency in markets. He did not focus as much as his predecessors on the right to affordable health care that is implicit in the name of the bill.  While conservatives have attacked the program -- focusing on the mandate -- with great clarity, the president's hesitant defense of this complex system has done little to rally the public behind it. Now he must wait to see if the Supreme Court offers his critics justification that he overreached with his agenda.   Follow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion  Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion"
Are voters ready to move on?,"With the Supreme Court's thunderbolt, a crucial battle is over on health care, but the war surely goes on. Or does it? There has been a widespread view among conservatives that if the court were to uphold Obamacare that would do more to galvanize the tea party and other parts of their base than any other outcome.  Anger and frustration can be powerful motivators in politics. On cue, Mitt Romney immediately seized upon the court's decision to whip up Republican voters, arguing that now the only way to replace Obamacare is to replace President Obama. House Republicans are promising a quick, symbolic vote to overturn the law after July Fourth. And conservative groups are preparing to pour in millions of dollars in ads against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that will begin hitting as early as Friday.   Opinion: Health care victory, but still a long way to go Clearly, the war moves to a new front as far as the right is concerned. And in truth, the GOP should be able to mobilize a higher turnout from its base this November. But the base alone will not be enough to win: The GOP also needs to draw in boatloads more of moderate and centrist voters.  And whether those folks are going to welcome new rounds of fighting over the health care law remains to be seen. My hunch is that a sizable number will think the war over health care has gone on long enough, and they will want to move on to more important issues. Jobs and deficits have long been trumping health care around most dinner tables. For better or worse, the court struggle came to be seen as the decisive battleground in trying to repeal the health reform law.  Partisans on both sides, along with the press, created an expectation that the court would strike down the mandate, the keystone in the arch. Obama would be shown as another ineffectual Jimmy Carter, losing much of his authority. Opinion: Liberty lost? The Supreme Court punts But now that the court has spoken definitively on behalf of Obama -- and even Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the president -- there is likely to be a sense that the dam has broken. Especially among those who have been ambivalent about health care reform legislation -- and there are millions who like portions of it even though they don't much like it overall -- psychology may change. ""Time to give it a rest; let's get our focus back to the economy."" How the public responds to the health care decision over the next couple of weeks will be critical. This is a  moment when tides could shift.  Obama was smart in his reaction to the court: He didn't gloat too much over his huge victory, and he left open the door to alterations in the law in the months ahead. After some weeks of stumbling, he seemed presidential.    Romney is riding a tiger: To stay on top, he must continue to give voice to the tea party -- and if he falls off, as the joke goes, they will eat him. But a series of strident attacks against Obama and his health care plan will not be enough.

Will one man keep Americans locked up in prison?,"A phenomenal thing has happened in Washington: Progressive advocates and conservative forces have united around legislative action supported by the strong majority of the American people.  Groups as disparate as the Center for American Progress and ACLU on the left and the Koch Brothers on the right; Republican Sen. Rand Paul and Democratic Sen. Cory Booker; and over two-thirds of the American people all support major overhauls to America's criminal justice system.  As do, presumably, the 2.2 million Americans ensnared in our nation's costly and counterproductive current prison system.  So what's stopping reform?  One man: Chuck Grassley.  Grassley is the senior Republican senator from Iowa.  He was first elected to Congress in 1975, serving first in the House of Representatives before going to the Senate in 1981.  That means Grassley's been in Congress long enough to have been there when the idea of mandatory minimum sentences for federal criminal convictions was first introduced.  In the 1980s, Congress passed so-called ""mandatory minimums"" as part of the national war on drugs, supposedly to make it easier to keep traffickers and kingpins locked up.  Yet by basically any measure, mandatory minimums have been a maximal failure.  Yes, nationwide the crime rate has declined in the past 40 years. But a new study confirms that America's drop in crime had very little, if anything, to do with mandatory sentencing laws and the increase in incarceration.  For instance, while incarceration played a small role -- estimated at around 5% -- in the drop of crime rates between 1990 and 1999, it had ostensibly no effect between 2000 and 2013.  Meanwhile the federal prison population has grown from 20,000 prisoners in the 1980s to over 200,000 prisoners today.  With states also passing mandatory sentencing laws, the prison population overall has skyrocketed.  Today, the United States has more people behind bars than any other country in the world.   One out of every 100 adult Americans is in prison or jail.  And the laws have had a disproportionately harsh effect on communities of color. For instance, on average, black male offenders are given sentences 20% higher than white males.  Meanwhile federal prisons are overcrowded by 40%, and incarceration costs eat up 25% of the Justice Department's budget.  The federal government could be investing more in public infrastructure jobs and higher education, since employment and education have proved to decrease crime rates dramatically. Instead, politicians are slashing food stamps and public assistance funding while spending $29,000 per year per inmate in federal lockup.  And as the conservative writer Betsy Woodruff wrote in Slate, ""When Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz both think the same bill is a good idea, you might think it would have legs.""    Yet it would appear Grassley just doesn't wanna change the rules. Grassley is the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Simply put, given the generally powerful position of committee chairs on Capitol Hill, if Grassley doesn't want reform to happen, it won't.  And he doesn't.  This past May, Grassley gave a floor speech voicing his strong opposition to the ""Smarter Sentencing Act."" Grassley connected America's drop in crime over the past decades partly to the use of mandatory minimum sentences.  Citing a year when the number of state and federal prisoners had dropped, Grassley argued there was a corresponding rise in crime despite other contradictory evidence.  Plus, Grassley said, ""the only tool Congress has to make sure that federal judges do not abuse their discretion in sentencing too leniently is mandatory minimum sentences.""   In Grassley's world, the war on drugs is working and mandatory minimum laws are a tool for combating liberal activist judges.  Given such illogical conclusions, one might jokingly ask whether Grassley is crusading against drugs or using too much of them himself. But to anyone paying attention, what seems illogical is Grassley's ability to stand in the way of a strong bipartisan coalition of his colleagues and the overwhelming weight of factual evidence and public support.  It's yet another reason Washington seems so dysfunctional.  It's one thing when one party in the majority passes, say, health care reform and then the other party stubbornly votes over and over again -- over 50 times -- to repeal the law.  That's undeniably pointless and absurd but can at least be chalked up to petulant partisanship.  Yet here we have that rarest of species in Washington, agreement -- and in alignment with facts and popular opinion.  The idea hat one person can stand in the way is insane.  This isn't what our Founding Fathers had in mind.  This isn't a checks-and-balances democracy.  It's more like a monarchy, where Chuck Grassley is king.  Over 2 million Americans may continue to waste away in our bloated and broken prison system, and more will probably join them, merely because the way Congress does business gives so much power to committee chairs such as Grassley.  Until there's a way around that, Washington will seem broken, too.    Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion."
The critical issue the first debate missed,"As America decides on its next president, two critical domestic issues are at stake -- the economy and health care. In their first debate, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump spoke at length on one: the economy. But how much time was devoted to the other? Absolutely none. Unless you consider Donald Trump's possible symptoms -- sniffling, fatigue, dehydration -- which suggest that his own health may have been partially compromised.  And though a candidate's health is important, the health of more than 300 million Americans is even more significant and worthy of discussion in the remaining presidential debates. In mid-summer, the Pew Research Center reported that 74% of Americans consider health care a critical issue in this election cycle. (Only the economy, terrorism and foreign policy scored higher.) Because it is an issue that affects every American, concern over health care is notably also bipartisan and steady across age groups. Though Obamacare reforms have slowed the rise of health care costs, added 20 million people to the ranks of the insured and created a revolution in health care information, there are still glitches in the system. The next president will be expected to guide the repair process -- and at the first debate we did not get to hear about that process. We need to going forward. Where do the candidates stand?   No one is happier with Obamacare than Clinton is. She says she will build on the Democrats' success and implement steps to improve on what we have, making the good even better. She has proposed several concrete steps to improve on Obamacare. Among them are tax credits to help with out-of-pocket medical expenses, offering more people the option of choosing the lower-cost Medicare system, stricter government oversight of prescription drug pricing and improved reimbursement and delivery of mental health care, including suicide prevention and mental health training for police. So far, the main thing we know about Trump's approach to health care is that he intends to immediately scrap Obamacare. Over and over again he has promised to ""end Obamacare and replace it with something terrific,"" but he has said almost nothing about how this would be accomplished. There is no way to simply roll back all of Obamacare without creating complete chaos. Indeed, so many people -- so many voters -- benefit from its provisions, including 20 million Americans who have been added to the insurance rolls under Obamacare and millions of others who have enjoyed benefits under provisions that expand coverage for families and individuals. Given those numbers, Republicans in Congress will hesitate to act as rashly as Trump would like. When he does offer a bit more detail on his health care policy, Trump recycles points made in a debate that ended long ago. He says efficiencies can be realized if health plans are sold across state lines, but insurance companies are already permitted to sell in whatever state they choose. He wants Medicaid block grants to give states spending flexibility, but the states already enjoy lots of power to tailor Medicaid to local needs and reduce regulations on drug companies.  Trump's misdirection and distractions Clinton has invested substantial time and energy into health care issues. Her website credits her work in health care as beginning in 1979, when she became chair of the Arkansas Rural Health Advisory Committee, a team working to expand health care access within the state. She was the driving force behind the attempted health care reform in her husband's administration and when it failed helped push the Child Health Care Program through Congress. As senator, she also made it possible for 9/11 responders to receive the health care they needed, and in 2009, she helped the Obama administration push through its sweeping reforms. In the current campaign, she has devoted considerable time on the campaign trail to explaining her health care platform. Besides his opposition to Obamacare, Trump has addressed health only as it pertains to his opponent. During the first debate, he said, ""She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she has the stamina to be president of this country you need tremendous stamina."" This sexist statement echoes the Trump campaign's ongoing effort to substitute innuendo for a discussion of health care issues that impact millions of Americans. Instead of saying how he will help more Americans access affordable quality care, he has dispatched Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York, to say Clinton looks ""tired"" and ""sick"" and urged voters to search the internet for information about her condition. In fact, following a few days of rest after a bout with pneumonia, Clinton appeared vibrant and alert both before and during the debate, which notably required her to stand in the camera's glare for more than the expected 90 minutes. In contrast, Trump sniffled, gulped water and peered at moderator Lester Holt with eyes that looked puffy and exhausted.  Although viewers may have been distracted by Trump's references to Clinton's ""stamina"" and by his own possible sickly symptoms, they are genuinely concerned about access, cost and quality of health care. They consider it vital to the well-being of their families and communities. Americans also understand that the country faces serious public health problems, including growing rates of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. As such, they want answers -- and they want them now -- about how the next president will improve a still broken health care system.  How a president's health can matter   Ever since Franklin D. Roosevelt showed that a determined and vigorous disabled man could be chief executive, presidents have served as health role models for the nation. With the exception of Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, who considered politics their sport, most have been eager to demonstrate their fitness. Jimmy Carter took to the tennis court. George W. Bush biked. Bill Clinton (now a vegan) balanced his Big Macs with running. Barack Obama badgers his aides about exercise.    Clinton is a woman of normal weight for her height. She works out three to four times per week, practices yoga and, unlike Trump, isn't a big fan of fast food. In addition to the bottle of hot sauce she always keeps in her purse (to boost her immune system), Clinton eats mainly fish and vegetables. As secretary of state and as a presidential candidate, Clinton has demonstrated remarkable stamina. Nothing in her records supports Trump's insinuations. And while conspiracy-minded bloggers like to speculate about her condition, there's no evidence that she is any less fit, physically speaking, than Trump.     In contrast, Trump's health habits should cause concern. At age 70, he is the son of a man who developed Alzheimer's and died with it. As the Alzheimer's Association reports, exercise of the sort Trump avoids and a diet far healthier than Trump's --   which he says is heavy on junk food --  can help forestall dementia. More importantly, good health habits preserve and improve the brain's functions. Trump, who has said his IQ is ""very high, one of the highest,"" should take note.   America's health must be top priority More important than the president's physical health will be his or her leadership. The United States spends more on health care as a percentage of its economy than any other industrialized nation. A study published in June in Lancet estimated that poor health habits cost the U.S. $28 billion in expenses and lost productivity. Worldwide, the figure was set at $68 billion, with $10 billion paid directly by individuals.  What does that money buy? Not much. According to a study published by the Commonwealth Fund, a dozen comparable countries enjoy a higher life expectancy. (Australians live, on average, three years longer than Americans.) America is bested by the same dozen in measure of infant mortality, obesity and chronic conditions.  The data suggest that with the right policies we can make improvements so that we live longer and better. For instance, the mortality rate in Massachusetts declined substantially in the four years after the state enacted a law mandating universal health care coverage, providing the model for the Affordable Care Act. But we need to know if the candidates are up to the job. The Pew report that found high voter interest in health care also noted that it is more important to voters than issues like guns, trade, Supreme Court appointments or abortion. So far, we haven't heard enough, especially from Trump, to determine whether the next president will be up to the challenge of health care reform.  In the two remaining debates, we need to hear specific plans for improving health care, especially from the candidate who hasn't offered any. Are you listening, moderators?"
Health care defeat confirmed it: Trump has lost round one,"As Congress lurches towards its August recess, Donald Trump's White House is coming up short. In the first 100 days, Trump's attacks were centered on the intelligence community, the media and the Democrats. These targets remain, but now the administration has new ones, too -- closer to home: the Cabinet and the West Wing. Anthony Scaramucci, Trump's newly anointed communications director, has threatened to fire his West Wing colleagues for leaks. Trump continues his vitriolic attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the first member of his cabinet to be confirmed and a key proponent of Trump's tough-on-immigration, tough-on-crime agenda. And Friday afternoon, he announced he was booting Chief of Staff Reince Priebus in favor of current Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Further afield, Trump's most desired friends seem to be attacking him. Vladimir Putin's Russia, the nation that Trump has most wanted to court, is retaliating against Congress' new round of sanctions by seizing US properties and calling for a reduction in its diplomatic staff by the end of the year.  And Congress' vote against the ""skinny"" proposal for health care reform might be the decisive blow in Trump Round One. But what more does this signify? For starters, it is crystal clear that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Some of the words have changed (and this matters), norms and ethics are taking a hit for sure, but few of Trump's campaign promises have materialized and Obama-era policies remain mostly intact. Even those Trump reversals with some traction (the travel ban, the decision to get out of the Paris climate agreement) face intense resistance and determination from civil society, the courts and the private sector. But two myths in particular are being rapidly debunked. One is that Trump's expertise in business would translate into rapid success in Washington. Instead, chaos in the White House, combined with the failure to appoint hundreds of senior staff to key positions across the executive branch, has helped generate an alarming level of dysfunctionality. Mixed messages out of the White House have sometimes been rationalized as a tactic that might help Trump succeed. But mixed messages and sudden policy reversals have mainly created a degree of unpredictability that now reads more as disarray and incompetence than strategy. When some countries send mixed messages, others know this is a coordinated game designed to confuse. With Trump, who is convinced? The second myth? Trump is the populist that America has been waiting for. Only it turns out this populist emperor has no clothes. The debate over health care reform has confirmed this. Trump's ambition to repeal Obamacare remained unwavering despite repeated analysis from the Congressional Budget Office that in the ""best-case"" scenario (that is, the so-called ""skinny"" bill), 15 million or more Americans would lose their health care almost immediately, and far more within a few years.   In fact, Trump's desire to repeal health care reform appears to be driven by the need to deliver tax cuts to corporate America, and also to tweet his success.  The question now is: What next? How much longer can this go on?   The prospect of dramatic change seems unlikely. At 36%, Trump's approval rating is historically low, but resilient. Attacks on Jeff Sessions -- who has been popular with Trump's base, pushed forward with immigration reform and taken a tough line on crime -- have not dented support for the President.   Ironically, the Republicans' failure to repeal Obamacare is likely to preserve support for the President. In the past several months, popular support for Obamacare has increased, and, based on the CBO projections, the dismantling of the program would have likely backlashed badly on Trump when millions found themselves paying dearly for health care.  On the face of it, Republicans in Congress also still support the President. Health care reform may have failed, but 49 Senators voted to repeal and replace Obamacare. Only three voted against this. But the President's room for maneuvering is shrinking. Congress has just voted for sanctions that would place significant constraints on the President's control over this critical lever of foreign policy.   Russia's retaliation underscores a growing trend -- the rest of the world is tiring of a President that cannot govern at home or be civil abroad. Governing is likely to become more, not less, difficult. But so long as Republicans continue to support Trump, the economy remains strong, and there is no obvious other game in town, the current series of debacles seems likely to continue."
Tea party rise will be short,"After the tea party's poor showing in the 2012 elections, many in the political world declared the movement dead. After all, it had lost one-sixth of its members in Congress and at least two Senate seats by running questionable candidates. Plus, the tea party didn't get its way on the debt ceiling, and the Paul Ryan budget failed to get much traction.  Recent CNN polls, however, suggest that gaffes by the Obama administration are breathing new life into the tea party movement. In a CNN poll conducted in March, 28% of the voting-age public supported the tea party. Now, however, in the wake of the recent controversies involving the administration -- especially the one about the Internal Revenue Service -- support is  on the rise. According to a CNN poll released May 20, 37% of the public now supports the movement, a level that approaches the high-water mark the tea party achieved in 2010.  Why the increase in popularity? It's simple: The IRS scandal resonates with the tea party faithful because it fits so well the meme the movement has pushed since the early days of the administration: An Obama-led government is too big, too fiscally irresponsible.   First, there was the movement's resistance to the stimulus package, claiming the government spent too much to revive the economy. Then, of course, was the tea party's opposition to health care reform: Again, government had grown too big, spending excessively. And that some people would be forced by the government to purchase insurance or else face a tax, for tea partiers, was further proof of Obama-led governmental tyranny. Now, the IRS scandal permits the tea party to highlight how the administration is overreaching and meddling in the lives of Americans.  But here's the thing: Most political scandals don't last very long. Those involving the president, or officials in his administration, tend to have a shelf life of six months. As it stands, we're not even six months beyond the most recent election cycle. So the likelihood that the tea party -- and therefore Republicans -- can leverage the recent scandals to their political advantage isn't great if the next election cycle (2014) is the target.  If the tea party and Republicans wish to make political hay that will carry them through 2014, they must return their gaze to the substantive policy issues that tend to mobilize their supporters: Immigration reform and same-sex marriage are two examples. Indeed, opposition to immigrant rights and same-sex rights has proven effective for rallying the base.  The problem is that if the tea party returns to issues proven to fire up the base it will  violate at least two of its major tenets: fiscal prudence and smaller government. For instance, the tea party's position on immigration reform would increase government spending to the tune of $28 billion per year to secure the border. In the case of same-sex rights, the state is called upon to regulate marriage. This would seem to contradict the tea party's claim that it's all about fiscal prudence and small government.  How can this be? In other words, how can the tea party and its supporters favor small and large government? The paradox is easily resolved once we consider the motives of many tea party supporters. They see America changing too rapidly, both demographically and culturally. American identity is generally identified as white and heterosexual, among other things. Thus, it shouldn't come as a shock that despite their declared preference for small government, many in the tea party embrace big government when necessary. It's perhaps the most effective way to police what they perceive as encroachments upon the ""American"" way of life in which white racial identity and heterosexuality remain the norm. Like American reactionary movements of the past, the tea party resists change of any kind.  For tea party loyalists, the long and short of it is as follows. In President Barack Obama's first term, the government spent too much; so far, in his second, the government is meddling too much. The problem for the tea party is that the benefits extracted from these missteps will likely be short-lived, certainly not enough to last until the next election cycle.  Isn't it ironic that to sustain support through 2014, and to have a shot at the White House, the tea party will have to push policy solutions to important issues that rely upon bigger -- not smaller -- government?

A small but important step for GOP in health care marathon,"A heartfelt standing ovation from both sides of the aisle welcomed Sen. John McCain as he cast the 50th vote to take up Obamacare repeal.  The decorated veteran and war hero, who returned to Washington after being diagnosed with brain cancer last week, said ""to hell"" with the ""bombastic loudmouths"" -- it's time to get something done.  With that, Senate Republicans have taken the first step in what will likely be a marathon effort to reform health care by voting to proceed with repealing Obamacare.  Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote. Zero Democrats supported the measure.   The 2016 election was a call for change after Americans lost faith in the failed policies of the Democratic Party.  Republicans campaigned and won on the promise to repeal Obamacare.  They must deliver on their promises. Congress needs to continue taking steps to follow through on its promise to repeal Obamacare.  After the Senate vote, President Trump said, ""This is the beginning of the end of the disaster known as Obamacare.""  After pulling the original Senate bill due to lack of support, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell managed to move some Senate GOP votes by making the pitch to simply open the debate on a couple of options.    The motion to proceed begins discussion on support for the 2015 repeal bill or the Better Care Reconciliation Act, known as BRCA.  The proposed BRCA  is a patient-centered, free-market approach that will cut the deficit, lower premiums and increase options. The bill will expand tax-free health savings accounts, give more funding control back to the states, protect pre-existing conditions, and allocate $45 billion to combat the opioid epidemic.    McConnell's strategy of starting a marathon with a few small steps won the day.    Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky had been a confirmed ""no"" until now.  But he voted in support of the motion to proceed, saying to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday, ""Let's start small and see how many pieces of repeal we can agree on.""     Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada (who is facing a tough re-election campaign next year) also opposed the first pass at health care repeal because it didn't protect Medicaid funding in his state.  The former holdout voted to proceed because, as he told CNN, ""Doing nothing to try and solve the problems it [Obamacare] has created isn't the answer either.""     Sen. Ted Cruz also supported the motion to proceed, saying, ""The American people rightfully expect us to keep our promises and get the job done.""   The reality is that Obamacare has been dying on the vine.  In 2009, Democrats made promises:  if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor; if you like your plan, you can keep your plan.  For millions of Americans, that was not the case.  Although Obamacare implemented a higher standard for policies, a report from the Department of Health and Human Services noted that, since 2013, premiums have more than doubled nationwide and next year, people buying insurance in Obamacare exchanges in 45 counties across the country could have no insurance carriers to choose from.   Voters sent Republicans to Washington to make good on their campaign promises to deliver relief from the Obamacare nightmare, and Congress needs to follow through and do just that.  As Ronald Reagan liked to say: ""There are no easy answers, but there are simple answers.""   The same principle applies to health care reform.  We all knew repealing Obamacare would be difficult, but the simple fact remains: The time is now for Republicans to act on health care, even if they have to do it by taking small steps at a time."
Can Romney connect with Latino voters?,"A few weeks ago, I said Mitt Romney's Hispanic outreach was not visible to the naked eye. I try to call 'em as I see 'em, even when it means criticism of my own party. Today, I see a Romney Hispanic blitz. Latino-Palooza is underway. Hispanic volunteers are holding events, making phone calls, knocking on doors. Romney began to spend significant resources on Spanish TV ads in swing states with a sizable Hispanic population. He's doing an interview with Telemundo, speaking to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and participating in a Univision Candidate Forum, all this week. My unsolicited advice to Romney: CONNECT! For the love of God, Mitt, acknowledge you are in front of Latinos. It's OK to talk to different communities about specific issues that affect them more than others. If done correctly and with sincerity, it is called speaking to your audience. If it strikes an inauthentic note, it's pandering.  Earlier this year, Romney spoke to the Latino Coalition. He mentioned ""Latino"" twice, once while thanking his hosts. Recently, he spoke at an event in Miami, Florida. You may have thought it was taking place in Miami, Ohio. He made no comments specifically targeted to the thousands of Hispanics braving the heat and humidity to hear him. Romney never mentioned foreign policy toward Latin America, not even Cuba. How someone fails to do that in the heart of Cuban-American Miami is puzzling. Barack Obama, for his part, has been working the Latino community. In the past six months, it's reached a fever pitch. The Democrat National Convention was a parade of Latinos: elected officials, celebrities, singers, students and even an undocumented young woman, representing the Dreamer students who would qualify for legal status under a potential Dream Act.  Obama knows winning the Latino vote is key. Just as crucial as the margin of victory is the level of turnout. Obama's task is to maintain his current numbers of 65% to 68% support and increase voter enthusiasm. Romney must chip away at Obama's lead. He will have a difficult time winning the election with his Hispanic poll numbers hovering around 30%. Hispanic events provide an opportunity to ask tough questions. Romney and Obama have some explaining to do. Like many other voters, Hispanics want to hear more specifics from Romney and Obama. Whether its economic policy or foreign policy, they would like the candidates to  get past lofty platitudes. Many Hispanics live in Florida, Nevada and Arizona, which have been disproportionately affected by the foreclosure crisis. They want to know how they are going to get out of houses that are underwater and mortgages that are overwhelming.  Hispanic unemployment has run significantly higher than the national average (now 8.1%) during the Obama administration. It is still high at 10.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On education, Hispanic dropout rates continue to be higher than the national average. Last year, it was estimated by one study to be as high as 28%. These are real problems that require real solutions. We want to hear concrete steps towards opportunity. Then there is immigration. Note to Romney: Take a deep breath. Close your eyes and jump! You must address this issue. Continuing to avoid it turns it into an albatross around your neck. Romney needs to move beyond his positions during the primary. He promised to veto the Dream Act. He should then tell us if and how he plans to confront the predicament these young people face. Proposing to staple a green card to the diploma of foreign students graduating from U.S. universities does not cut it.  While he's at it, he should say what he plans to do about the administrative order issued by the Obama administration that provides Dreamers temporary status for two years. If he becomes president, will he revoke it or will he let the order stand for at least the initial two-year period? A simple yes or no will suffice.  There also needs to be a responsible plan to deal with securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws but also providing a practical and humane solution for the 11 million undocumented people already here. Unless it's meant as a lame attempt at humor, ""self-deportation"" is not an adequate response.  Talking of self-deportation, there's a question as to whether Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who advocates the concept and is credited as the architect of Arizona's controversial SB1070 law, is an adviser or a supporter to Romney. Which is it? Romney has not publicly embraced Dreamers, but he's had no difficulty embracing the guys who give us nightmares, such as Sheriff Joe Arpaio, U.S. Rep. Steve King of Iowa and Kobach. How should Hispanics feel about that and what role, if any, would any of them play in a Romney administration? Obama has his share of explanations to give. Many Latinos have felt great economic pain during his administration. Some of us, who don't think we should give one inch to anti-democratic regimes in Latin American, did not like seeing Obama in a discussion of missile defense, tap then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on the knee and promise more flexibility in a second term. What does that mean vis-a-vis the likes of Fidel Castro or Hugo Chavez? In 2008, Obama promised Hispanics he would pass comprehensive immigration reform. He had a majority in the House and Senate and a powerful mandate for his first two years, and he failed to so much as present a plan, much less push for its passage. Blaming Republicans for his broken promise is silly. He passed his other priorities, including health care reform and the stimulus package, with practically no Republican support.  Those first two years, where Obama showed will, he found a way. He chose not to make immigration a priority. Why should we believe him now? How does he plan to pass any meaningful reform in his second term when 1) he will be a lame duck from day one; and 2) he will in all likelihood have a Republican-controlled House and very divided Senate? Obama has not been known to cultivate congressional allies, Democrat or Republicans. Passing controversial legislation will not be easy. Four years ago, Obama chanted, ""Si, se puede!"" (Yes, we can!) He's grown older and grayer; so have we. He couldn't and didn't in his first term. He'd be well-served to acknowledge that and take some responsibility, instead of just laying the blame elsewhere.  Hispanics are disappointed in Obama and distrustful of Romney. Both of them have seven weeks to change that. The clock is ticking. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion"
Rape can make you pregnant. Period.,"Rep. Todd Akin made news this weekend by announcing that pregnancy from ""legitimate rape"" is rare. He further argued that physicians had told him that women who were traumatized in such a way had biological things happen in their bodies to ""shut down"" the ""whole thing"" so that fertilization won't occur. There's so much wrong here that it's hard to know where to begin. Let's start with the basics. The human body is intricately designed and exquisitely evolved to make procreation possible. In fact, some would argue that it's our primary purpose. So you have to understand that everything about our biology is there to make it easier, not harder, for a woman to get pregnant. Women can get pregnant if intercourse happens under water. Women can get pregnant from sex in any position. Women can get pregnant even when they think that they can't get pregnant due to menstruation. If you put sperm near egg, women can get pregnant. Republicans distancing themselves from Akin remarks There is nothing at all about a woman's mindset that affects this. Women can't wish pregnancy away. If they could, then many teen pregnancies wouldn't occur; few teens want to get pregnant. But think of the larger picture. Women in abusive relationships get pregnant. Women in horrible socioeconomic conditions get pregnant. And, yes, women who have been raped get pregnant. The body doesn't differentiate between ""legitimate"" rape and ""illegitimate"" rape -- whatever that is. The body doesn't know whether the rapist is known to a victim. The body doesn't know if a knife or a gun, or alcohol or drugs (or any combination of them), were used. Every sexual encounter does not lead to pregnancy, but every sexual encounter leads to the possibility of pregnancy. Period. Akin flub puts abortion at center of campaign debate So why would someone say such a thing? While it's hard to get into the mind of another individual, we can guess. This line of reasoning isn't new. It's been used for the most part to delegitimize the idea that exceptions to abortion prohibitions should exist for rape. After all, if you really believe that abortion is the taking of a human life, then it's hard to suggest that there is any rationalization for it at all. While ethically consistent, this belief is rare in the United States. Even among those who oppose abortion, most people support exceptions for rape and incest. It's hard for a politician who firmly opposes abortion to square this. Such a person wants the support of a majority of people but doesn't want to compromise principles. One option, then, is to find a way to make the occurrence of the problem nonexistent. If pregnancy from rape doesn't happen, then we don't need exceptions in the law. The problem, of course, is that such pregnancies do occur. More than 31,000 of them happen in America every year. Pretending they don't by listening to a few anecdotes won't make them go away. This is what happens when reality gets in the way of our moral convictions. Life is tricky. It's nuanced and complicated and often fraught with contradictions. Contrary to what you read, most people don't have black and white views of abortion. Few believe that it should be prohibited when it might save the life of a mother. Few believe that it should be allowed a week before a fetus is full-term. In other words, relatively few people believe abortion should never be legal, and few believe it should always be legal.  This places abortion in the gray zone. That doesn't work well for elections. It also doesn't make for clean philosophical discussions. It certainly doesn't make for good sound bites. A further problem with proclamations like Akin's, though, is what they sound like to women who have been raped. If you believe what he does, then anyone who did get pregnant wasn't ""legitimately"" raped. Moreover, it belies a willful ignorance of science. Rape has occurred in history time and time again. Women get pregnant from it. This is known. There is no debate to be had. Opinion: Why Ryan is not bad for women Those who support Republicans, and even Akin, in this election believe this to be a distraction and a problem. They're right. History shows that statements like this can turn close elections. A win in Missouri for the Democrats may mean that they retain control of the Senate. Moreover, this will be what we are talking about this week instead of the economy, jobs, or health care reform. That's bad for Romney and Ryan. The good news is that all of this is avoidable. Stick to science. If people did that more, they wouldn't have to claim they ""misspoke"" later.  Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion"
What's stopping job creation? Too much regulation,"""Businesses adding jobs"" is a headline every elected official loves to read. Sadly, it's one that's getting harder and harder to find because of a policy and regulatory landscape that makes it increasingly difficult for businesses to see why and where creating new jobs makes sense.  That's especially true for me and my colleagues in the restaurant industry, who find ourselves facing a plate piled high with more and more federal, state and local regulations.   Regulatory mandates flowing from federal health care reform may be the most visible, but the list also includes measures such as new mandatory paid leave provisions that require us to change the way we accommodate employees who need to take time off when they are ill and ever more unrealistic requirements regarding employee meal and rest breaks that, in California for example, force our employees to take breaks in the middle of serving lunch or dinner.    This reality is the result of the best intentions. Policymakers working in silos at every level are pushing through regulations that on their face seem to address admirable goals -- that are each directed at outcomes that seem desirable.   The cumulative effect of these regulations, however, is significant damage to the hard-working Americans who are the intended beneficiaries.   The employer mandate contained in the new health care reform law, for example, forces us to change the way we have offered health care coverage to our full- and part-time workers and, together with all the other looming regulations, causes us to rethink the way we schedule the hourly work force that is at the heart of how we deliver our product to customers.    Some suggest we accommodate the costs of new regulations in one of two ways:  Accept lower profits, or charge customers more. Neither is a realistic alternative for many businesses, and certainly not for those in our industry. Like most in retail, low profit margins are a fact of life for us for good reason -- low margins are consistent with charging prices our customers can afford.    The difficult reality is that neither our shareholders nor our customers -- who are of course, the very working people policymakers champion -- can afford the cost of the unbridled increase in regulation we're experiencing.   This is not to say that the restaurant industry should not be appropriately regulated. Food safety and cleanliness standards are just two examples of categories of regulation we welcome given their importance in helping protect two critical elements of our promise to our guests, which are their safety and well-being.    So, what are restaurants doing about all of this? We are labor-intensive businesses and always will be, but we're relying more and more on technologies that make our businesses less labor intensive. It's an ominous development considering restaurants' role as a path to opportunity and entrepreneurship.    More than half of today's adults worked in food service at some point in their career, for example -- whether as a first job, a way to pay for higher education, a bridge to a new direction in their lives or as a path to a career in restaurant or food service management.   To preserve this important driver of economic opportunity, we need policymakers to understand the snowball effect of too many regulations. Their collective effect is to threaten job creation and prevent us in the restaurant industry from doing our part to put our economy back on its feet.   Policymakers and pundits bemoan the economic news of the day and chastise the business community for not ""investing"" or creating jobs to help lead us out of the recession. But through the lens of a business owner, a regulatory ""perfect storm"" is forming that causes even the most well-intentioned business leaders to pause.   Some industries -- including the restaurant industry -- continue to grow and add jobs, but what we see on the horizon puts that at risk. In the year ahead, the company I lead expects to open roughly 80 new locations, each with about 100 jobs. The entire industry projects adding 1.3 million jobs over the next decade, according to the National Restaurant Association.   My plea to policymakers is simple: Before you impose another well-meaning mandate, consider the burden we already bear and engage us in conversation. Regulations are not inherently detrimental to growth. Responsible companies such as ours, that have been supportive of the president and elected officials of both parties across the country, won't say ""no"" to everything and, indeed, what you might find is that we can help craft solutions that truly are better for everyone.    Our success depends on our ability to deliver on three promises: a promise to our guests to provide them exceptional dining experiences at appropriate value; a promise to our employees to provide them jobs with appropriate compensation, benefits and opportunity for advancement; and a promise to our shareholders to provide them appropriate returns on their investment. Our ability to deliver on these promises in the future is directly challenged by the regulations we see as we look ahead.  Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter"
What Romney needs to say to win,"One and only one argument has the potential to deliver Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to the White House. The argument comes in two parts, the first of which is perfectly familiar. The only way to address our mounting debt and put back to work the millions of Americans either jobless or underemployed is to grow the economy.  Businesses large and small must recover a level of security and freedom to expand their operations, make capital investments and grow their workforce. It's the second part, though, that Romney needs to drive home tonight: Why he can be trusted to make that growth happen. Additional public spending does not present a sustainable policy platform. The nation's deficits are simply too great and the returns on public investments too low for the federal government to be able to spend its way out of this economic malaise. 
Alone, those austerity measures that stand any chance of enactment -- and here, Paul Ryan, take heed -- will register only passing blows to the federal government's extraordinary financial obligations. If Europe offers any lesson, it's that serious drawdowns on the federal budget threaten whatever economic recovery is under way. Politics: For Romney, the speech of his life Growth, and growth alone, promises a way forward.  Unrelated discussions about abortion, immigration, White House leaks, the dysfunctions of Washington or patriotic sentiment merely distract from the only argument that matters. Additionally, some of these discussions genuinely threaten to fragment the Republican Party and alienate swing voters. Meanwhile, every pertinent discussion about financial regulation, the tax code, international trade and entitlement overhaul must reinforce a central message of growth. So far, so good. But the argument cannot end there if Republicans hope to reclaim the presidency. As Ryan himself admitted Wednesday night, ""By themselves, the failures of one administration are not a mandate for a new administration. A challenger must stand on his own merits."" And so the second part of the argument, and the one that needs shoring up the most during this convention, is that Romney and Ryan offer the best chance for economic recovery. The Republican Party must give the American public reasons to believe that their ticket offers the leadership needed to grow the economy. In the first two nights of this convention, they have not. Repeatedly intoning that ""we can do better,"" as a steady stream of convention speakers have done, will not suffice. The question is not whether ""we"" can do better, but whether Romney can do so, whether there is something in Romney's personal history, character or vision that can bring about the kind of economic recovery that, so far, has eluded the current administration. Although delegates dutifully applauded to scripted lines, the speakers offered little of lasting value, little that undecided voters could hold on to when the Democrats have their turn next week. Ryan, to be sure, had his moments. He proved most effective when he lambasted President Obama not just for having enacted a health care reform that, in his view, amounts to ""2,000 pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees and fines that have no place in a free country,"" but for insisting that we, as a nation, engage a long, divisive debate on health care amid a financial crisis and massive unemployment. Ryan also did a nice job of conveying his allegiance with the owners of ""restaurants, cleaners, gyms, hair salons, hardware stores,"" and of signaling his appreciation for the hard work and dedication required to run a small business. And in perhaps his best line of the evening, Ryan recognized the disaffection of the youth who have been most hurt by the economic downturn. ""College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life."" But much of Ryan's speech, following on the budgetary reforms that launched him to national prominence, centered on the debt crisis in isolation. Ryan's critique of Obama's stimulus package started and ended with the observation that ""money wasn't just spent and wasted -- it was borrowed, spent and wasted."" But Ryan did not do nearly enough to spell out why this matters for economic growth, or what Romney would have done differently. Ryan's subsequent reflections on faith and family, his insistence that individual rights are afforded by God and nature rather than government, and his thoughts on the nation's ""moral creed"" may have stirred the Republican base, but it did little to sharpen the singular message that stands some chance of tipping the election. Politics: Romney defends 'sterling' business record He made passing reference to Romney's ""rescue"" of the 2002 Winter Olympics, but he did not produce any examples of companies that Romney resuscitated while working in the private sector. He did not offer specifics on which, if any, of Romney's dealings at Bain Capital improved the lives of workers and the long-term prospects of their employers. While recognizing that Romney as governor of Massachusetts balanced the state's budget without raising taxes, Ryan also did not describe how that bluest of New England states grew economically under Romney's watch. Ultimately, of course, others cannot make the argument on his behalf.  Romney must deliver it himself. All of the speeches we have heard so far are mere warmup acts to Romney's time behind the podium. The stakes couldn't be higher. If Romney does not succinctly and powerfully state that growth is essential, and then personally and movingly address how he would do that, Obama may well become the first president to win re-election since Franklin Roosevelt when the unemployment rate stood above 8%.

"To get immigration reform, elect a Republican","Now that President Barack Obama has broken his promise to take executive action on immigration, and put off the thorny issue until after the midterm elections -- and I predict, for the remainder of his presidency -- many immigration reform advocates are angry, surprised and disappointed. I'm none of those things. Here's my take: When it comes to Obama and immigration, keep your expectations low. Despite what he says, don't make the mistake of thinking that he actually supports legalizing the undocumented. Finally, whatever he says, don't assume it's the truth. When it comes to immigration, Obama has a long trail of half-truths and broken promises. In July 2008, the presidential candidate told the National Council of La Raza that, if elected, he would make the issue a top priority and address it within the first 100 days. That didn't happen.  White House officials then moved the goal line to, well, the first term. That didn't happen either.  From 2009 to 2011, Obama told supporters that he couldn't curb deportations because he was ""not a king.""  Yet, in 2012, eager to re-engage Hispanic voters for his reelection, Obama summoned his inner monarch when he unveiled ""Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals,"" which gives undocumented young people a temporary reprieve from deportation and work permits. In 2013, Obama did another about-face and returned to his rhetoric about how he couldn't act alone to stop deportations. He also gave half-hearted support to the Senate immigration bill, which would militarize the border and only legalize about half of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.  Now, we're in another election year, and Obama is back to cynically using the promise of immigration reform to get Latino voters to turn out. He dangles it like a carrot in front of a donkey pulling a cart. Speaking in the Rose Garden on June 30, Obama bemoaned inaction by the Republican-controlled House and promised to take executive action before the end of summer. Lawmakers urge Obama to work with Congress on immigration Well, summer is over, and Obama is backing out of the deal.    Some on the left are finally getting the message that Obama is not their amigo.  Cristina Jimenez, the managing director for United We Dream, an advocacy group for undocumented students, told The New York Times: ""The president's latest broken promise is another slap to the face of the Latino and immigrant community."" For Obama, the question is never what he can do for the immigration issue but what the immigration issue can do for him.  It's no surprise that some on the left have realized that they have to do for themselves. Just a few hours before Obama's retreat, I was having breakfast in Southern California with one of the leaders of a prominent grassroots immigrant rights organization. He wanted me to connect his group with Republicans who support immigration reform because it might pressure Obama to act.    I can do one better. Want to get comprehensive immigration reform? Elect a Republican president.  Congress passes laws, but the president sets priorities. Just like Obama did with health care reform, which is why we call the new law ""Obamacare"" and not ""Pelosicare"" or ""Reidcare.""  Once you see through the political fog on the immigration debate, you realize that Republican presidents are a better bet for delivering reform.  Three reasons: First, ignore what politicians say and watch what they do. Democrats campaign as soft on illegal immigrants, but they're tough on them once in office. Republicans campaign as tough on illegal immigrants, but they're soft on them once in office.  Second, look at history. In 1986, it was a Republican president, Ronald Reagan, who signed an ""amnesty"" bill into law. Twenty years later, it was another Republican, George W. Bush, who boldly kicked off the modern debate over comprehensive immigration reform by proposing legal status for the undocumented. Meanwhile, it was a Democrat, Bill Clinton, who militarized the border with Operation Gatekeeper in 1994 and signed a 1996 immigration law that made it easier to deport people and harder to return.  Now we have another Democrat, Barack Obama, who has deported more than 2 million people, roped local police into enforcing immigration law through the program known as Secure Communities and shipped thousands of child refugees back to Central America without due process. Third, understand human nature. Republicans don't love immigrants. But they love business, and business loves immigrants. Meanwhile, Democrats don't hate immigrants. But they love unions, and unions hate immigrants. Obama: Waiting will make immigration executive action 'more sustainable' Still, electing the right leaders is only half the job. The rest of it is holding them accountable.   Latinos should be furious at Obama's betrayal. But they should save some anger for themselves for believing the lies. As for Obama, he continues to insult Latinos with more blame-shifting and double talk. Now he insists that his decision to delay any executive action on immigration wasn't based on politics -- except when it was. On Sunday, during an appearance on NBC News' ""Meet the Press,"" Obama told moderator Chuck Todd that contrary to earlier reports, he was not trying to help Democrats in Congress keep their seats in November. Instead, he realized that the recent surge of unaccompanied minors across the US-Mexico border changed the political equation.  ""The truth of the matter,"" Obama said, ""is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem."" To summarize, the president who didn't have enough courage is blaming his ineptitude on child refugees who had an abundance of it. Breaking his promise made the President look dishonest. Admitting that it was about politics made him look weak. But blaming it all on the kids made him look pathetic.  Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

"For GOP, it's time to focus on winning","Marco Rubio.  Chris Christie.  Mitch Daniels.  Paul Ryan.  Say those names, and Republican hearts beat faster. Mitt Romney.  Rick Santorum.  Newt Gingrich.  Say those names, and Republicans faithfully and accurately say we can beat President Obama, but something feels missing, even as late in the primary season as Super Tuesday. The fact of Republican life today is that the party was fundamentally transformed by the tea party movement in 2010.  The party's base is driven by a reform it now, anti-spending movement, while its presidential candidates served their terms in office prior to the tea party era, and their records don't match up perfectly with the direction of the party. The reason former Sen. Santorum supported earmarks in Congress is because when he served, virtually everyone supported earmarks. The reason Gov. Romney passed Romneycare as governor of Massachusetts in 2006 was because many Republicans viewed health care reform, mandates and all, as a way to inoculate against Democratic charges that Republicans didn't care about people who lacked health insurance.  It wasn't until the summer of 2009 that the tea party burst on the scene in response to President Obama's expensive and unworkable health care ""reform"" legislation. Today, grass-roots Republicans want to drink a bottle of 2010 small-government wine, but our candidates were bottled in another era, before the tea party's ideas took root.    Throughout American history, every era presents its own set of problems and answers, which over time yield to a new set of problems and answers.      The 2000s were marked by terrorism and a bipartisan desire to fight it.  Deficits then were not the issue they are now.  No one in either party objected to war in Afghanistan because it might cost too much or last too long.  We were attacked, and our nation demanded a military response.  No one objected to spending tens of billions of dollars to rebuild New York or the Pentagon.  The war in Iraq began with significant bipartisan support.  The 2001 tax cuts were passed with bipartisan support, especially in the Senate.   Almost all elected officials wanted seniors to receive prescription drug coverage and the only difference between the parties was over how much it would cost.  (Former President George W. Bush's Medicare Part D plan was far less expensive than the one proposed by then-candidate Barack Obama.  Neither Bush nor Obama suggested how to pay for it.)   The 1990s were marked by a dot.com boom that resulted in hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue pouring into the treasury.  In an era of divided government, the nation enjoyed surpluses and tax cuts.  The boom went bust in March 2000. The 1980s were time for a military buildup and a fight against communism.  The 1970s were highlighted by Vietnam and inflation, while the 1960s were known for the civil rights movement, the Great Society and dramatic social change. In each of these eras, as some of the issues were addressed, the solutions created new problems for the next generation to deal with. Flash-forward to the present.  The tea party movement and its passion arose in response to trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see and out of a sense that Washington is in need of dire fiscal reform.  In 2010, the public turned against Obama and the Democrats who ran Congress after a massive stimulus that didn't work, and hundreds of billions of dollars were spent on cash for clunkers, homebuyer tax credits and multiple bailouts (by both Bush and Obama).   A massively expensive new health care entitlement was the straw that broke the taxpayers' back.  Our debt is a record high $15 trillion. This is the political and economic environment today.   Rubio, Christie, Daniels and Ryan represent the new vintage of Republicans whose focus is on fundamental reform of how government spends money, but those bottles remain on the shelf.   Republicans this cycle are thirsty for a taste of something new and different.  That's why Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and even the new Newt each had a chance to win, but their candidacies fell short.  Reflecting the new direction of the party, the candidates who remain have put new labels on themselves, even if their contents aren't pure as many in the party want them to be. In November, however, voters will face a different choice.   The GOP choice might not be everything Republicans want this year, but the alternative that Obama is selling will leave our nation permanently intoxicated by big government, more spending and massive debt. The time is near for Republicans to stop focusing on our differences and instead focus on winning.  Follow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion"
Health care act reforms must not be lost,"I know what relief looks like.   Not long after the Affordable Care Act became law, I saw it in the eyes of a friend. We'd said goodbye in her office, so I was surprised to hear her calling my name as I flagged a cab.  But standing in the cold, she explained that health insurance for her toddler had been elusive because of a pre-existing condition; she wanted to know if it was true -- did the reform bill mean she could get insurance for her child?   I assured her that it did, and then I saw it.  Relief.  A burden removed. Millions of people have had that same experience in the past two years.  Because of the reform law, the worst insurance company abuses are over.  The Affordable Care Act will end the practice of charging women 50% more than men for the same coverage.  By 2014, the same prohibition that now prevents insurance companies from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions will extend to adults.    And it's illegal for an insurance company to impose a lifetime cap on coverage and toss people out of the health care system at the very moment they may need it most. About 105 million people had lifetime caps, and 20,000 people hit the cap every year.  But now that threat is gone, and families -- like my friend's -- have a sense of relief.  But in addition to helping the sick get well, the Affordable Care Act helps prevent the healthy from becoming sick.  At least 86 million Americans have benefited from free preventative care, and that means that 32 million seniors -- almost three-quarters of those enrolled in Medicare -- got a free service in 2011.   It means that 54 million people with private insurance, including over 20 million women, had access to critical mammograms and colonoscopies, as well as tests for diabetes and high cholesterol. It means that African Americans who suffer with high blood pressure at rates much higher than other communities can prevent disease before it starts.  It means that Latinos who are more likely to develop cervical cancer and less likely to be screened for colon cancer can get the tests they need to catch these diseases early.  And for those young adults who often bet on invincibility -- unable to afford insurance as they enter the workforce -- the Affordable Care Act means they no longer have to worry about coverage if their luck runs out. Young men and women can stay on their parents' insurance until they turn 26, and 2.5 million who would otherwise be uninsured have done just that, including 1.3 million young people of color.   Opinion: Why the health care reform law is unconstitutional Life before and after the Affordable Care Act is different.  And the good news is that health care for Americans will only improve.  In 2014, every single American, regardless of  circumstances -- whether they want to change jobs, start a business, or even if they lose their job -- will have access to affordable, quality health insurance.  For 70 years, presidents have tried to improve our health care system. President Obama did it. And yet, this week, the threat to these reforms is evident.  Many Republicans -- led by those contending for their party's presidential nomination -- are chanting ""repeal and replace"" as the Supreme Court hears arguments questioning the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.   The chant is more a bumper sticker than a serious plan to address America's health care crisis of rising costs and uneven access.  Not only are Americans opposed to repealing the law, but the head ""repeal and replacers"" don't have a credible alternative to put in its place.    The challenge to the law that is before the Supreme Court is a clear and present danger to both a well-reasoned understanding of the Constitution and good policy.  While the key issue at the heart of the debate -- the constitutionality of the individual mandate -- wouldn't touch the lives of the vast majority of Americans who already have insurance coverage, it is a critical element of the law if we're going to lower costs and ensure that those with pre-existing conditions get the help they need.   Everyone has to be in the pool.  Unfortunately, smart policy sometimes falls victim to constitutional arguments -- remember campaign finance reform. For that reason, proponents and opponents of the law watched Tuesday and Wednesday's arguments before the court with great interest -- and the usual armchair quarterbacking commentary and crystal ball gazing predictions.  In spite of the sound and fury, no one really knows what the outcome will be.    We do know that the justices often aggressively challenge the lawyers before them, and that challenging might have little bearing on the ruling.  It's important to remember two things.  First, the majority of lower federal courts -- including judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans -- have found that the law sits within the boundaries of the Constitution.  And second, conservative judges who sit on those courts and ultimately supported the law were sometimes the harshest questioners. The Affordable Care Act is helping individuals and families and our economy.  Once the chanting is over and the Supreme Court has ruled, the good work must go on.

"Despite flaws, health care law is needed","With the Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments about the constitutionality of the President Obama's health care law, more patients than ever have been asking for my thoughts about health reform.   I practice primary care in southern New Hampshire near the Massachusetts border, which gives me a firsthand look at how health reform has impacted my neighboring state. Despite flaws with the Massachusetts approach, and the president's Affordable Care Act which is modeled after it, I believe that health care reform needs to move forward.  Read a transcript of Monday's court arguments Over the years, I have encountered too many cases of patients who are inadequately served by our current health care model. Some of their stories are heartbreaking, others are deeply worrisome.  Some time ago, I had one middle-aged patient with diabetes, whom I'll call Mark, requiring high doses of insulin to control his blood sugar. He faithfully saw me every three months, where I made careful insulin adjustments so his sugars wouldn't go too high or low. But all of a sudden, he stopped coming. I didn't hear from him until a year later, when I received a call from the emergency department telling me Mark was found in a coma because of a critically high sugar level. Thankfully, he survived his hospital stay, and when he came for a visit afterward he explained how he had lost his job, and thus, his health insurance. He couldn't afford to see me or buy his medication. According to the 2010 Commonwealth Fund survey, 72% of jobless Americans said they couldn't afford to fill a prescription or obtain needed medical tests. Worse, 40% said that medical bills forced them into difficult financial decisions, such as depleting their savings, or being unable to pay for necessities like food, heat or rent. These are choices patients should never be forced to make.  But it's not only patients without insurance who suffer. Others are in a situation like another patient of mine, whom I'll call Linda. She recently told me that her sister was diagnosed with colon cancer, a disease with a strong genetic component. I recommended that Linda have a colonoscopy.  Unfortunately, her health insurance plan had a deductible in the thousands of dollars, making a colonoscopy prohibitively expensive.  Last year, a study from the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, found that families enrolled in high-deductible plans like Linda's cut back on health care that was clearly beneficial, like cervical cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer screening. According to the study, ""these cutbacks could cause a spike in health care costs down the road if people end up sicker and need more intensive treatment."" The Affordable Care Act would help patients like Mark, by providing him a way to obtain affordable health insurance regardless of his job status.  Beginning in 2014, health reform would expand the eligibility of Medicaid and provide federal tax credits to help buy private insurance. On average, 17% of the nonelderly population nationwide would be helped, with numbers as high as 36 to 40% in parts of Florida, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and California. And for patients like Linda, health reform would prohibit cost sharing for many preventive screening tests, including colonoscopies. My support of the Affordable Care Act is tempered, however, by a serious flaw: Its benefits cannot be fully realized without a strong primary care foundation. In the United States, the number of specialists to primary care doctors is about 70-30, a ratio that's reversed in the rest of the world. That primary care deficit is a far bigger threat to health reform than if the Supreme Court were to rule President Obama's law unconstitutional. Having health insurance doesn't necessarily mean that you'll be able to see a doctor. In Massachusetts, more than 95% of residents have health insurance, the highest in the country. However, a 2011 Massachusetts Medical Society survey found that more than half of primary care doctors were not accepting new patients, while the average wait time for an appointment exceeded one month. When you consider that health coverage will expand to 32 million Americans in 2014, whether our strained primary care system can handle that burden is a serious question. An inability to see a primary care provider will force patients to already crowded emergency departments, where health care is often the most expensive. The Affordable Care Act doesn't do nearly enough to make primary care enticing, despite the anticipated shortfall of primary care providers approaching 30,000 by 2015. Medical students, concerned by their average school debt approaching $160,000, often eschew primary care in favor higher paying specialties. And the bureaucratic burdens of primary care, including paperwork and spending time on the telephone refuting insurance company denials, are overwhelming. According to an Annals of Internal Medicine study, 30% of primary care doctors considered leaving the field entirely, citing burnout, time pressures and administrative hassles.   These concerns, however, shouldn't stall health reform. Instead, they need to be addressed as the Affordable Care Act is modified and improved on in the coming years. Far too many patients can no longer afford to obtain basic care. It's their stories that have made me realize we desperately need to fix our broken health care system, and accept health reform despite its shortcomings. We cannot let the pursuit of perfection become the enemy of doing the right thing. Patients like Mark and Linda need help now. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion"
Opinion: Can Trump make election a verdict on Obamacare?,"News headlines suggest this election is largely about sex and emails. These issues matter, they reflect on the character of the presidential rivals. But 48 hours on the campaign trail this week has convinced me that more substantive things are running through the minds of the voters. I had to encourage some Republicans at one Trump rally to talk about the FBI. But people need no encouragement to discuss Obamacare. And I'm hearing it mentioned among nonpolitical Americans in bars and cabs. Open enrollment for the insurance exchanges began Tuesday and consumers who logged on were in for a shock: Monthly premiums are up by an average 25%. Why? Even though the vast majority of those enrolled in Obamacare get a tax credit, which creates a subsidy to reduce how much they have to pay, the President's signature health care reform offers a great example of his mixed record, of good intentions undermined by reality.  The number of uninsured in the United States is down, which is surely good. But government interference in the market has had consequences. Compelling everyone to buy a product raised demand. But Obamacare's effect on insurers' costs and profitability prompted a number of them to flee certain state markets, reducing supply for consumers. For instance, in many Arizona counties there's only one insurer selling exchange plans for 2017. The premium for the benchmark plan has more than doubled across the state. In Oklahoma, for those not eligible for a subsidy, the premiums can go as high as 69%, and in Alaska, monthly premiums can reach $760. Trump, as you can imagine, is making a big play out of this. I saw him speak about it in Philadelphia on Tuesday, in a speech that was scripted, direct and effective, although it left out some key details, including the subsidies.  But even if there's more nuance than the Republicans admit, the Obamacare mess does help Trump in three critical ways. First, it's the kind of story of administrative failure that suggests the government doesn't know what it's doing and needs a new broom. Those with memories of the Obamacare website's disastrous start will confirm that it's become a byword for incompetence. An embarrassment. Second, Obamacare's implementation is a story of half-truths. Americans were told they could all keep their doctor or their plan. This turned out to be untrue. Finally, when voters stop to think about Obamacare they are reflecting upon the President's record. For many Americans it's a legacy of slow growth in the economy and in their wages -- of only just keeping their heads above the water. Crucially, that's a legacy Hillary Clinton has endorsed and promised to protect: She says she only wants to increase government's role in health care, not reduce it.  Her strategy is part of the transactional relationship between the Obamas and the Clintons -- couples who were never close and were even at loggerheads during the 2008 campaign. But thereafter they developed a political interdependence. The Clintons campaigned strongly for Obama in 2012; Obama is now touring the country to show his support for Clinton. And Clinton presumably hopes Obama's charisma will rub off and attract minority voters. ""Seriously,"" she famously asked, ""is there anyone more inspiring than Michelle Obama?"" -- a tacit admission that she is personally about as inspiring as the color beige. A braver politician would not have tied herself to Obama's wider legacy. Bernie Sanders said it was insufficiently radical; there was plenty of scope to say that Obamacare was a good idea but deeply flawed. Clinton, perhaps because she has been so closely aligned with health care reform her whole public life, has chosen to defend and expand it. That means she now owns it. And if the voters decide on balance that they don't like it -- which polls suggest is the case -- then she's in trouble.  If Obamacare ends up mattering, then maybe this election is more conventional than we think. The candidates offer standard partisan policies on health care: Democrats favor state regulation, Trump offers a free market approach by, say, allowing people to purchase health care across state lines. Moreover, a dynamic of people passing a verdict on an incumbent President by punishing his chosen successor is as old as the republic itself. As the polls even up -- and they are definitely getting closer -- one explanation to entertain is that this election is at some level both typical and mundane. People are voting against the incumbent and for change. No one can deny the role that working-class anger and cultural reaction has played in Trump's support. But it's likely that for millions who vote for him, the decision is a rational one that they calculate is best for their family."
How the Affordable Care Act can still work,"Aetna, one of the country's largest insurers, made headlines Tuesday when it announced it is pulling out of health care exchanges in 11 of the 15 states where it now offers insurance.  That's not surprising -- the exchanges are the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). And Aetna is a major presence: It had about 800,000 exchange customers at the end of June benefiting from the right to buy insurance and to pay the same price as anyone else their age, without regard to their health. As a result, the company's announcement is being seen as a huge blow to the ACA, and is raising questions about the viability of the program. But this does not necessarily mean that we are witnessing the gradual death of the program nicknamed Obamacare. The system still can work. But before looking at potential solutions, it's worth looking at what prompted the decision by Aetna -- and other insurers before it -- to consider backing out. Most people who buy insurance on the individual exchange are eligible for the income-based subsidies that are part of the ACA. In many cases, these subsidies will cover the bulk of the cost of the insurance. But Aetna claims its reason for leaving is that the insurance pool on the exchange is less healthy than average. Other insurers have also cut back their participation, ostensibly for the same reason. Aetna, for example, claims that it has lost $430 million on the exchanges over the last two and half years. To put this loss in perspective, this would be a bit less than 0.3 percent of its about $150 billion total revenue over this period. And while this loss is not bankrupting the company, insurers are certainly not in business to lose money, so its alleged losses are a serious issue. (As an aside, it is worth noting that Aetna is currently fighting the Justice Department over plans to merge with another major insurer. It therefore seems at least possible, as Sen. Elizabeth Warren has suggested, that Aetna could see announcing pulling out of exchanges as a way to put pressure on the Justice Department to allow the merger.) But assuming the losses are real, it is important to note that they are due to the mix of people who are buying insurance on the exchanges, not rapidly rising health care costs. In fact, health care costs have risen far less rapidly than the Obama administration predicted when it proposed the ACA. Spending on health care services, which accounts for the bulk of health care costs, rose just over 4% annually from 2010 through 2015. This suggests that there are two ways to address the problem with ensuring the exchanges are viable. One would be to force insurers to take the less healthy people on the exchanges as a condition of being able to insure more healthy people outside the exchanges. This goes to the root of the fundamental problem the ACA was set up to solve. Insurers are always happy to ensure healthy people, because they mostly end up sending the insurance company checks for nothing. The point of the ACA was to keep the less healthy people and the more healthy people in the same pool. Making participating in the exchanges a condition of doing business in the state is one way to effectively accomplish this result. The other route is the public option that President Barack Obama proposed in his campaign for health care reform. If the government offered a Medicare-type plan in the exchanges, it would likely draw in a large enough pool that it would be able to offset the cost of less healthy people with plenty of healthy insurees. Either of these routes could get around a problem of the exchanges drawing a less healthy pool of applicants. And that in turn suggests the issue is not so much whether the exchanges can be kept intact -- they can. Instead, it comes down to something else: whether Congress wants to ensure that as many people as possible are able to actually get health insurance."
It's not the unemployed who are backing Romney,"One of the most dominant theories of this year's presidential election is that President Barack Obama's re-election prospects have been undermined by high unemployment levels.  Yet despite a dismal labor market, which saw a net increase of only 103,000 private-sector jobs for August, the president has been widening his lead over Mitt Romney in recent days. This raises the possibility that other factors are trumping high unemployment.    To be sure, the fact that the unemployment rate has remained above 8% throughout Obama's first term has greatly contributed to the sense among many that his economic agenda has been a failure. Perhaps the most memorable speech at the Democratic National Convention, by former President Bill Clinton, was devoted to defending the current president's job creation record, a clear sign that Democrats recognize it as their central vulnerability.  Opinion: Bill Clinton brings it for Obama Yet one of the ironies of the 2012 presidential campaign is that the incumbent president has benefited from strong support among many of the constituencies that have been hardest-hit by high unemployment levels, particularly black Americans and Latino Americans. This has left the Romney campaign in the position of having to win over voters who've fared relatively well since 2008.  Unfortunately, we don't have reliable or consistent data on the political preferences of the unemployed. The numbers we do have are fragmentary. For example, a recent survey of 18-to-29-year-old voters sponsored by the Youth Engagement Fund found that while only 14% of Romney voters were unemployed, almost a third of Obama voters were unemployed. Undecided voters fell somewhere in between, with 25% of them unemployed. This hardly settles the question, but the fact that the president fares so well with demographic groups that have experienced higher unemployment rates is nevertheless suggestive.  Perhaps the most obvious explanation is that voters interpret economic data through the lens of their cultural and political affiliations.  Voters who are disinclined to favor a Democratic incumbent will be more likely to interpret disappointing jobs numbers as an indictment of Obama while voters who are more favorably disposed towards Democrats will maintain that he is doing the best that can be expected of him in the face of powerful economic and political headwinds.  With that in mind, we can learn a great deal by taking a closer look at different groups in different states.       For example, of the three states with unemployment rates above 10%, two, California and Rhode Island, are heavily urban, coastal states that overwhelmingly support Obama. The third, Nevada, is more closely contested, though most surveys find that the state is leaning toward backing the president. This is despite the fact that Nevada is one of the states that has been most adversely impacted by the housing bust. The state is also 27% Latino. And though its electorate is considerably less so, the fact that Latinos tend to favor Democrats more strongly than do white Anglos has given the president a significant boost. Opinion: Three hurdles for Obama, Romney The political configuration of states with unemployment levels from 8% to 10% is also quite interesting. Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina are all in the Romney column.  Several of these states are part of the cultural region political analyst Sean Trende has called ""Greater Appalachia,"" a region that moved toward the GOP even as the rest of the country moved away from it between 2004 and 2008. Others, including Mississippi, Georgia and South Carolina, have electorates that are defined by racial polarization.  The large black minorities in these states tend to be strongly Democratic while the white majorities tend to be strongly Republican. Moreover, unemployment rates in the black population in these Deep South states tend to be much higher than unemployment rates in the white population. This implies that many of the president's strongest supporters in these states have been touched by unemployment, either directly or indirectly, while many of his staunchest critics have emerged unscathed.  Many of the unemployed and underemployed households in these states have benefited from the extension of unemployment benefits, the expansion of eligibility for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and other social transfer programs that the president and congressional Democrats fought for as part of the 2009 fiscal stimulus law and in subsequent budget battles with congressional Republicans.  The Obama-supporting states with unemployment levels between 8% and 10% -- such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in the northeastern United States, Illinois in the Midwest and Washington and Oregon in the Pacific Northwest -- are states in which college-educated voters, who've fared relatively well in the post-crisis economy, have shifted to the Democratic Party at least since the Clinton presidency.  These are in a sense the Obama voters who don't present much of a puzzle -- relatively insulated from the weak economy, they're more likely to vote on the basis of their socially liberal values. Less affluent voters in these states, meanwhile, disproportionately benefit from the aid programs championed by the president and his allies.  Opinion: Harsh realities for Democrats Earlier this summer, John Hudak, a political scientist based at the Brookings Institution, shed light on this underlying dynamic by considering how Democratic and Republican officials at the state level have responded to Obama's health care reform, the Affordable Care Act. So while Democratic elected officials rely more heavily on the support of voters who are far more likely to be uninsured, e.g., black Americans (22% of whom are uninsured) and Latino Americans (32% of whom are uninsured). Republican elected officials, meanwhile, reply more heavily on white voters, only 14% of whom are uninsured.  There are a number of contested states in the 8% to 10% unemployment range, including Michigan, North Carolina, Florida, Colorado and Arizona.  Florida, Colorado and Arizona are all states in which a surging Latino population has given the Democrats a foothold. North Carolina has a large and politically engaged black population as well as a growing population of college-educated social liberals, the combination of which has made the state more politically competitive than neighboring South Carolina.  Michigan, which is still considered a swing state despite having voted for Democratic presidential candidates since 1992, is quite distinctive. It has a black population slightly larger than the national average and a high concentration of union members, many of whom are clustered in the politically important automotive industry. The Obama administration has frequently touted its support for the auto industry, the cost of which continues to climb.  As recently as last year, former auto czar Steve Rattner claimed that the ultimate cost to taxpayers of the $82 billion of government funds invested in the GM and Chrysler bailouts would be $14 billion. Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department estimated that it would eventually cost the federal government $25.1 billion. Michigan voters have good reason to believe that an Obama administration would be more likely than a Romney administration to offer domestic automobile manufacturers future cash infusions.  Many states with unemployment levels between 6% and 8% are solidly in the Republican camp; for example, Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and West Virginia. These are states that have done reasonably well during the Obama years but nevertheless oppose his re-election.  The states in this tier that back the president include states with large numbers of affluent college-educated voters and large minority populations, such as Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts and Delaware, and also states with very distinctive demographic profiles, such as heavily Asian Hawaii, heavily Latino New Mexico and Maine, a state that is both very white and very poor. The swing states in this tier -- Wisconsin, Ohio and Missouri -- are states in which Mitt Romney will have to win over large numbers of employed white voters. And that is also true of New Hampshire, Virginia and Iowa, swing states in which the unemployment rate is between 4% and 6%. New Hampshire is heavily white and socially liberal, and its economy has fared well in recent years. Romney will thus have to make an ideological appeal to tax-sensitive voters concerned about deficits and debt. A similar dynamic applies to Iowa as well. Virginia has a large minority population that is supportive of Obama, but it also contains a large number of tax-sensitive suburbanites who might be amenable to Romney's conservative message.   Romney has oil-and-gas-oriented low unemployment states such as South Dakota, Wyoming and Oklahoma locked up. But the incumbent is comfortably ahead in Minnesota and Vermont.   At a state-by-state level, at least, there doesn't appear to be a straight line between high unemployment levels and opposition to Obama. High unemployment does matter -- but judging by the state of the race right now, it seems to matter more because employed voters, including many who've fared relatively well in recent years, see it as a sign of economic failure than because unemployed voters will turn out against the president in droves.

Can Obama sell America on its own values?,"Tonight, President Obama will give a pivotal speech, perhaps the most pivotal speech of his second term. He will address the nation from the Oval Office and make the case for an air attack against Syria.  He is expected to stress that the attack will be limited, a direct response to what the administration has said was the al-Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. He is expected to identify the specific objective and then present the evidence -- some of which has made it to YouTube -- and ask the American people to urge their senators and representatives to authorize the use of force.  The speech will be pivotal not only because it will frame the president's foreign policy on the Middle East but because it will -- or should -- reveal the philosophy behind that policy. Of course, it will have to convince the American people to buy into that philosophy as an agreed-upon expression of American values. He will have to relate this action to things our nation has done in the past and things it hasn't done. In short, he will refer to the ""should"" and ""should not"" of history -- our history. With this speech, the pundits will decide how much political capital the president has left. Given the media's recent track record, that decision will not be based on the content of the speech or even its effect on the debate but on some arcane scoring system. (Of course, some on the right maintained Obama was ""running on empty"" from the moment he was elected.) How effective Obama will be during the rest of his term -- how much of his agenda becomes reality -- may well depend on his performance tonight. Ironically, according to much ""conventional wisdom,"" this is not a speech the president had to give. Under existing law and his authority as commander in chief, he could have ordered the strikes. In fact, had he done so, he might have had more support in Congress, and there would have been less time for opposition to coalesce.   (Still, Secretary of State John Kerry's proposal Monday that Syria turn over its chemical weapons to an international agency is welcome news and once again demonstrates that President Obama and Secretary Kerry are seeking a solution, not an excuse to attack Syria.) The Oval Office venue for the speech is significant. ""The Oval Office invokes the center of the presidential authority. That's the president's office; that's where he supposedly makes decisions, where he governs,"" says presidential historian Robert Dallek. ""The Oval Office symbolizes power."" Indeed, looking through AmericanRhetoric.com's list of the top 100 speeches from the 20th century, of the top 50 since television became the dominant medium, aside from Nixon's resignation,only three were delivered from the Oval Office: Eisenhower's farewell address, Kennedy's Cuban Missile Crisis address and Reagan's ""Challenger"" disaster address. Those addresses, and others, indicate why in this case the Oval Office might be the right venue. In each case, the president tied a specific moment or decision not just to the needs of the moment or the reasons for the decision but to the definition of who we are -- and why.  For example, Ike spoke of balance: ""Good judgment seeks balance and progress. Lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration."" JFK spoke of courage: ""Our goal is not the victory of might but the vindication of right, not peace at the expense of freedom but both peace and freedom."" Reagan spoke of challenge and discovery: ""They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths."" We might do well to reread them, for in addressing the need of a moment, they defined our character. So, yes, it may seem a ""risky"" venue in which to give a ""defining moment"" speech. But David Kusnet, chief speechwriter for former President Clinton, says ""Oval Office addresses are much better suited to reporting on what is being done than advocating for what should be done. If President Obama can report that progress is being made, an Oval Office address is a good venue for such an announcement."" And we should note this about Barack Obama, in any case: His career has been one understated high risk.  He ran for president as a freshman senator against a well-established and deserving opponent; he confronted the ""big question"" of race in one of the great game-changer speeches (JFK, anyone?). He reversed the economic freefall, pulling us out of the Great Recession. He staked his presidency on health care reform and achieved something every president tried to do for half a century. (FDR!?)  And all this against not a reasoned opposition but one of rabid hostility. Obama has a task: Yes, he must justify military action. But since World War I, perhaps the one unforgivable act has been the use of chemical weapons. Civilized humanity has banned them, even in combat, certainly against civilians, especially children in your own country. Convince the public that al-Assad masterminded the attack, and Congress will authorize. But Obama should do more. He should challenge us to have the courage to ask: What are the limits of indifference? And he should say, let our judgment match our humanity. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

"Do Gingrich, Santorum know how to lose?","So we're at a point in the campaign where health care reform is about to go on trial at the Supreme Court, unemployment remains high and gas prices are skyrocketing. As for the GOP presidential wannabes, they're arguing over, um, an Etch A Sketch metaphor bungled by a Mitt Romney staffer. (""You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again,"" Romney senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN this week.) Sure, the metaphor has a perfection all its own, given Romney's penchant for redrawing policy lines. It's just low-hanging fruit, hard to pass up. But the picture of two ""serious"" presidential candidates wandering the trail with an old-school toy as a prop can lead to only one conclusion: This is getting silly. The intellectual arguments have been made. The differences have been debated. And the voters are speaking. Sure, they're conflicted: hard-line conservatives and evangelicals will never love Romney. But Romney has what appears to be an insurmountable delegate lead. He will not sprint across the finish line, to be sure. He will crawl across it. But he will get there nonetheless. If this were another time, the establishment power brokers would step in with a vision. They would take the candidates aside, give them the big-picture analysis from 30,000 feet and say: ""Unite for the sake of the party."" Then they would take to the airwaves and offer their full-throated endorsements, turning their attention to seeking the defeat of President Obama.   Not happening. Consider this: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush endorses Romney, but there's no rally, huge photo op or choreographed endorsement tour. One prominent tea party group says, well, I suppose we can live with Romney if that's what we have to do. And tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, stops short of endorsing Romney but grudgingly allows that ""I think we all need to look at this presidential primary and encourage the candidates to do a little self-reflection here -- what's good for our country."" The moves toward Romney have all of the enthusiasm and passion of an arranged marriage. So what can be done? Answer: Not much. The next moves are up to the candidates. First of all, the old-time power brokers don't have much to offer anymore. The political power within the GOP has moved away from any organized structure toward two force fields: the populist guy in the street and the rich guys who can write multimillion-dollar checks. The super PAC sugar daddies -- simply by virtue of their money -- are the reason the campaigns continue. What's the incentive for Newt Gingrich to get out as long as Sheldon Adelson, from his perch in Vegas, is willing to keep paying for his political ads? The same goes for Foster Friess, Santorum's man, who gets to dabble in politics from his mountain views in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I bet these fellows haven't had this much fun in years. Meantime, the newly populist GOP grass roots won't be told what to do anyway. Party organizations can't deliver them anymore, and Romney isn't exactly the guy they were wishing for when the tea party came on the scene in 2010. The establishment is in disrepute as far as they're concerned; those are the people who bungled the economy. ""People feel they can make this decision on their own,"" Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole, who hasn't yet endorsed, tells me. ""There's just a lot less party loyalty. ... We are in a period where people are searching.""  At some point, though, the search has to end. The money men could get tired of writing checks for fewer and fewer delegates. The math may become overpowering. At some point, the voters will get restless. Yet the final decisions will have to come from the men running. Granted, Gingrich and Santorum don't like Romney much -- and the longer they run against him, the less they like him. And often with good reason. But here's the final consideration: ""You don't want the blame for losing,"" Cole says. ""It's one thing to fight the good fight. ... But look at Romney in 2008. He knew when to get out."" Yes he did. Romney knew how to end it the right way in 2008. After Super Tuesday, he saw the handwriting on the wall and embraced John McCain. And there's a lesson in that: Parties reward the winners, sure. But voters like good losers, too. Knowing how to lose is the hardest part of running.

Romney bailed out on Massachusetts,"Rudy Giuliani committed a classic Washington gaffe on CNN's ""State of the Union"" this past Sunday -- he told the truth.    When asked about his criticism of Mitt Romney back in 2008, Rudy explained that it was a campaign contrast influenced by ego, but admitted that at the time he was comparing ""my far superior record to his otherwise-decent record.""   Surrogates aren't supposed to toot their own horn. They're supposed to loudly recite the party line. But Rudy is an independent-minded kind of guy and when asked a direct question, he answered.     The reason that Rudy had a better record in office than Mitt is actually pretty simple -- he worked at it in New York City nonstop for eight years.  In contrast, Mitt was MIA from Massachusetts much of the time when he was governor.    Under Rudy's leadership in New York City, crime and welfare rolls were cut in half, ahead of national trends.  As the quality of life improved, so did the local economy -- with businesses and families reversing a decades-long exodus.  On the fiscal conservative front, Rudy excelled as well, cutting or eliminating 23 different taxes while reducing the rate of spending below the rate of inflation plus population.     I'm biased here to the extent that I served as Rudy's chief speechwriter in City Hall and deputy policy director in his 2008 campaign.  But as another esteemed New York political leader, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, once said, ""everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts."" Rudy remains controversial, but his record by the numbers is not a matter of opinion -- it is a matter of fact.    Mitt's record in Massachusetts is more limited because he was only in office for one term and halfway through that period he started laying the groundwork to run for president. Mitt is running on executive experience, but it is as a businessman and turnaround artist -- not as chief executive of Massachusetts, the only government leadership position he has ever held.    There's no question Mitt accumulated an impressive record as the innovative founding executive at Bain Capital, and he deserves a lot of credit for turning around the Salt Lake City Olympics. But his record of accomplishment in government is much more limited and far less innovative. His CEO approach to dealing with the Democrat-dominated legislature fell flat.  And after assuming the chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association for the 2006 mid-term elections, he spent two-thirds of his time out of state.   So it's not a surprise that he declined to run for re-election as governor; instead, he announced he would run for president in 2008.    This is a straightforward recital of the facts -- a more detailed portrait of his time in Massachusetts can be found in the essential book ""The Real Romney,"" written by two Boston Globe reporters, Michael Kranish and Scott Helman.  But suffice it to say that Mitt is a very goal-oriented guy, and after achieving the governorship, he set his sights quickly on the next challenge -- the one that had eluded his beloved father -- the presidency.    The central achievement of Mitt's government career in Massachusetts was the mandate-driven health care reform he now tries to ignore but which he once touted by saying that ""an achievement like this comes once in a generation.""  He even chose the bill to appear in his official state portrait.  The plan wasn't just a signature achievement, it was considered a political asset in running to succeed President George W. Bush.   The country was tired of polarization, and Mitt could provide a problem-solving antidote, a demonstrated ability to bring a Republican solution -- the individual mandate -- to a problem that Democrats traditionally cared most about. It was an approach entirely consistent with the way he campaigned for office in 2002 and also consistent with the Romney family political philosophy established by his father, George, when he was an effective and popular governor of Michigan in the 1960s.    Risking re-election was also deemed to be a political loser. If he ran and lost, his presidential ambitions would be toast.  That's why Mitt was the last in 16 years of Republican governors for stereotypically liberal Massachusetts.  The trend was set by centrist William Weld after he succeeded Michael Dukakis in 1990 and extended by Paul Cellucci.  But Mitt pretty much buried that trend and didn't even try to extend it back in 2006.  He wasn't a trailblazer as much as a trail-ender in this regard.                        But the biggest tell was the now infamous 180 on social issues he had pledged to defend while trying to get elected in the first place.  In July of 2005, he penned an op-ed in the Boston Globe saying that his ""convictions have evolved and deepened during my time as governor"" -- the once staunch defender of a woman's right to choose began describing himself as ""firmly pro-life"" just in time to hit the national conservative circuit.   Likewise, his commitment to advance ""full equality"" for gays and lesbians quickly fell by the wayside.  Ditto past statements on guns, greenhouse gases, abstinence education and immigration.  These are politically pragmatic decisions when someone is planning to run for the Republican nomination, but they are not the actions of a conviction politician.    In contrast, John McCain and Rudy -- two of Romney's rivals in 2008 -- are quintessential conviction politicians. They put real stock in concepts of honor when it comes to the political arena, and it often gets them in trouble.  It would have been far easier for Rudy to reframe his position on abortion or adjust his rhetoric to the right on guns, gays or immigration.  But Rudy's not that kind of guy. Mitt is.      Mitt's missing record in Massachusetts reflects the fact that he treated that executive office as a launching pad for his presidential ambitions.  And it is an irony of presidential politics that the signature health care bill he intended to used as evidence of his political vision became a liability from which he had to distance himself four years later.   The quintessential turnaround artist when it comes to business, he never really attempted a turnaround of Massachusetts. Instead, his inattention helped end 16 years of Republican gubernatorial rule.  That is, unfortunately for Mitt, also a matter of record.

"Two Donald Trumps, or two Ben Carsons?","Ben Carson, who presents himself as highly religious, sober and careful, endorsed the profane, grasping, bully Donald Trump for president on Friday, explaining: ""There are two Donald Trumps.  There is one who sits on the stage and the one who is cerebral ... and that's the one you are going to start seeing more and more of."" As Carson announced his endorsement, he skirted his history with Trump, who during the campaign said Carson had been a ""pathological"" liar and who suggested this problem was as incurable as pedophilia.  ""If you're a child molester, there's no cure, they can't stop you. Pathological, there's no cure."" But on Friday the soft-spoken Carson said, ""We buried the hatchet. That was political stuff."" Besides, Carson repeated: ""There are two Donald Trumps.""  ""There's the Donald Trump that you see on television and who gets out in front of big audiences, and there's the Donald Trump behind the scenes,"" he said. ""They're not the same person. One's very much an entertainer, and one is actually a thinking individual."" Carson, who seems to set a very low bar when it comes to who might be qualified to occupy the Oval Office, spent an hour with Trump and concluded he had the right stuff because, ""You can have a very good conversation with him.""  There is, indeed, more than one Donald Trump. One is the public man who offers stream-of-consciousness riffs laden with insults and distortions. But the ""thinking individual"" whom Carson described is also real, to a degree. I met this version of the man briefly during each of my five encounters with Trump, when he submitted to questions for my book about him.  Unfortunately, the cerebral Trump didn't hang around very much. In the hours we spent together, this fellow lacked a true understanding of even the issues and quickly ran out of things to say. When this happened, he reverted to talking about his wealth, his brilliance and his winning ways. A typical example was his answer to my question about whether he had used drugs as a college student in the 1960s. He tried to answer the question at hand, but soon started to stray. He said: ""I never had drugs. I'll tell you what -- one of the things that helped me so much -- and this could be important. I've been very successful and people are starting to find out I've been much more successful than people even admit. People are starting to figure that out. Much more successful. You're not covering economics or finances, I guess, but I'm much richer than people understand."" Trump's tendency to stray into self-promotion and pride is perhaps the only consistent element in his personality. It has been on display for as long as he has been in the public eye.  In the 1970s Trump sought recognition for his accomplishments as a real estate developer years before he had, in the parlance of the trade, put two bricks together. In the 1980s, this man with no diplomatic experience or training offered himself to negotiate an arms control treaty with the former Soviet Union.  He has, throughout his life, been a public critic of everyone from Ronald Reagan to Al Gore and he has been willing to flirt with bigotry -- his attacks on Muslims and Mexicans are a prime example -- in order to make his points.  So inconsistent is Trump that over the years he has been both pro-choice and anti-abortion as well as in favor of and against stricter gun control. Trump displayed his dual nature in real time as he interacted with Carson during the endorsement press conference.  Trump first considered the ""two Trumps"" theory Carson offered and said, ""I probably do agree. There's the public version ... it seems to have worked over my lifetime,"" he said. ""I think it's different than the personal one.""   But soon after making this agreeable statement Trump changed course. ""I don't think there are two Donald Trumps,"" he declared. ""I think there's one Donald Trump.""  It was a strange moment in a campaign that, thanks to characters like Trump and Carson, has been full of strangeness. Carson's oddities have included the claim that health care reform is ""the worst thing that has happened to this nation since slavery"" and he has said that Planned Parenthood was founded to control the black population and that ""most of their clinics"" have been located in black neighborhoods. Neither claim is true. Carson's limited grasp of the issues was evident time and again during his campaign for president. To his credit he would sometimes confess that he wasn't prepared to answer a question, and this honesty suggested a certain admirable integrity.  But now, with his endorsement of a man who has repeatedly demonstrated cruelty, narcissism and a loose relationship with the truth, Carson's own character comes into question. We always knew that there was more than one Trump. Now, it seems, there's more than one Carson as well.      Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

What's really at stake in election 2012,"The stakes in this election go far beyond just who takes the oath of office in January.  Each of us is faced with choices that will have huge ramifications in our nation for decades -- and the choice is not simply about Democrats versus Republicans or even Obama versus Romney.  The real stakes are this:  The political strategies that prove successful in this election will be replicated far into the future.  Throughout this election cycle, we've seen hyperpartisan narratives resonate more than facts, total opposition embraced as a congressional tactic, and unprecedented dark money flow through our airwaves in an avalanche of negative ads.   If those forces are rewarded, we'll see much more of them from both parties going forward. They will become the new normal.   Opinion: Vote, damn it! If they are rejected, it may inspire a necessary recalibration and a renewed focus on finding ways to work together in Washington. This won't be just because it's the right thing to do; it will be because it is what is seen as practical and politically expedient.  When President Obama took office, the fiscal crisis was in full effect, but our nation was briefly united after the 2008 election. Then the partisan media started to try to repolarize the nation for their profit.   A relentless drumbeat of demonizing the president gave rise to all sorts of dark conspiracy theories, driven by the conviction that the first African-American president of the United States was somehow un-American.  Hating Obama became a profitable cottage industry, with the publication of at least 89 different obsessively anti-Obama books -- more than twice the number that were directed at President George W. Bush by the end of his first term. Unhinged ideas seeped perilously close to the mainstream, to the point that the gap between partisan narrative and actual facts seems cavernous and finds fellow Americans divided beyond reason.  This has real civic cost. A president who has presided over a doubling of the stock market is called socialist or even communist.  A president who ordered the killing of Osama bin Laden is seen by some as secret Islamist-sympathizer. And perhaps most important, a president whose actual record leads respected nonpartisan political scientists at the VoteView blog to say ""President Obama is the most moderate Democratic president since the end of World War II"" is instead seen as a far-left liberal.  A reality check is overdue.  This hyperpartisan reality distortion field has impacted Congress as well. In the past, we've achieved a great deal with divided government -- ranging from the Marshall Plan, to the interstate highway system, to the achievements of the Reagan administration, to welfare reform and the turning of deficits into surpluses under President Bill Clinton and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich.  But the current congressional environment has led to division and dysfunction, Super Committee fails and justifiably low congressional approval rates.  Too many conservative members of Congress took Rush Limbaugh's 2009 anti-Obama admonition -- ""I hope he fails"" -- to heart. They argued that confrontation rather than cooperation with the new president was the best strategy. Thanks to Obama's unwise overdelegation to congressional Democrats on the stimulus bill, their approach was validated, and so an economic recovery effort that was one-third tax cuts passed along stark partisan lines. A pattern was established.   President Barack Obama: My vision for America  An individual mandate-driven health care bill, based on proposals from the conservative Heritage Foundation implemented by Mitt Romney in Massachusetts, was not praised as policy triangulation -- taking a Republican approach to achieve a Democratic goal -- but called an unconstitutional gallop toward socialism. Rational debate stopped when talk of ""death panels"" started taking hold.  And so health care reform became the first major piece of social legislation to pass along stark partisan lines.   Even onetime bipartisan legislation was no longer embraced by Congress. For example, Obama's proposed jobs bill was almost entirely composed of what had been bipartisan proposals -- but it was considered DOA on Capitol Hill.  The debt ceiling was used to hold America's full faith and credit hostage, with disastrous results, including the downgrading of our AAA credit rating.  The source of much congressional dysfunction is the now-routine use of the filibuster by the Senate, making a supermajority of 60 votes necessary for meaningful action.  As a point of historical perspective: In the eight years that Republican Dwight Eisenhower was president, from 1953 to 1961, the filibuster was used only two times.  In the four years that Barack Obama has been president, the filibuster has been invoked more than 200 times by Senate Republicans.   Add to this unhealthy civic mix the unprecedented amount of money flowing into this election -- expected to exceed $6 billion total.  The most troubling aspect is the rise of dark money, the abuse of tax-exempt 501(c)(4) organizations to hide donors while flooding the airwaves with negative ads.   According to the Center for Responsive Politics, spending from these nondisclosing groups has passed $200 million in this election -- more than every other election cycle over the past 20 years combined -- and 88% of the ads airing now from outside groups are negative.  Just three groups -- the Karl Rove-founded Crossroads GPS, the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce -- account for more spending than the next 17 outside groups combined. This makes a mockery of post-Citizens United promises about unlimited money being combined with unprecedented disclosure, and the net impact is chilling: This is perilously close to what trying to buy an election looks like.  All this matters, because if outside money spent on negative ads can indeed sway an election, we will see much more of it in the future. But if partisan billionaires believe that their money has been wasted, it will help rein in such efforts going forward.  We need to stop the cycle of incitement in our politics, where every action creates an equal and opposite reaction. In the closing weeks of this campaign, Romney has been promising that he will bring bipartisanship back to Washington. But simply slapping on a new slogan won't solve these underlying problems.  Mitt Romney: My vision for America If Romney is elected president, Democrats will likely decide to follow the apparently successful path of the Republicans in recent years -- play to the base with fear-mongering claims, demonize the new president from Day One, and obstruct his agenda in Congress.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, has already announced that he will not work with a President Romney, taking a page from his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, who pledged that making President Obama a one-term president was his No. 1 priority. Republicans will complain, but they will have their own precedent to thank. The result will be all-but-guaranteed gridlock and division over the next four years.  If Obama is re-elected, it will send the message that all the hyperpartisan distortions, the intensely ideological congressional obstruction and the flood of dark money didn't work.   Republicans will have to confront the fact that these extreme tactics backfired by alienating the moderate majority of Americans (and interestingly, Obama currently leads among moderate voters in key swing states like Ohio by nearly 20 points). This will alter the landscape of the next Congress and shift the incentives back toward working together on a more bipartisan basis.  It might even help re-center the Republican Party going forward, something I would sincerely like to see because it would be good for our democracy.  America needs to break this fever of hyperpartisanship. The day after the election, we will have to start healing as a nation. Members of Congress will be confronted with a fiscal cliff and serious questions about how to deal with taxes, spending, the deficit and the debt. If they feel that extremism and obstruction have been punished by the voters, they will find a way to work together. If either party feels it has achieved an ideological mandate, it will be tempted to play chicken with the fiscal cliff.   The stakes are so high because they cut to the heart of the American experiment. We cannot continue to allow extreme partisan distortions to define our policy debates and paralyze our capacity for constructive self-government.   We need Washington to get the message that I've heard from swing voters so often on the CNN Battleground Bus Tour -- stop fighting and start fixing.  Find a way to work together, especially on our long-term economic problems. That means both parties agreeing to compromise on issues of taxes, spending and entitlement reform -- a balanced bipartisan plan to deal with deficits and debt. It will require putting the national interest ahead of all partisan special interests -- and we won't be able to do that until this fever breaks.  Washington is looking to your lead at the voting booth.  These are the stakes.  Now it is your decision. Go out and vote on November 6."
Bill Clinton's lessons for Obama,"Sometimes it feels like President Clinton never left the public spotlight. Although there were moments during the 2008 campaign when it seemed he was as much of a target within his own party as were the Republicans, these days Clinton is everywhere and Democrats want him by their side. Members of President Obama's campaign team say Clinton will offer them his services next year. The re-emergence of President Clinton in Obama's circles has been gradual. It has taken time to recover from the tensions that flared during the 2008 Democratic primaries, when some Democrats accused Clinton of making racist remarks following Obama's victory over Sen. Hillary Clinton in South Carolina. But over the past year, the White House has brought him back on more and more occasions to strengthen Obama's standing. What explains the former president's appeal -- beyond his knowing how to work the necessary magic that got him re-elected in 1996 and left booming approval ratings at the end of his presidency? His strengths offer some guidance for President Obama to improve his standing, even beyond his campaign. The first is that President Clinton was very successful at counteracting Republicans when they attacked. One of President Obama's great frustrations has been the ""messaging wars."" He has frequently been frustrated by how the GOP portrays him to the public and defines his policies in unfavorable ways. Clinton didn't let the GOP do that easily. When Republicans painted the president as left of center early in his term, he responded by aggressively highlighting his centrist credentials, lowering the deficit in 1993 and reforming welfare in 1996. Although he accepted their terms of debate, unlike when President Obama has done the same, he was able to follow through on that co-optation by strengthening his party's standing. When House Republicans shut down the government over spending, Clinton helped convince the public that they were extremists, forcing Republicans to backtrack. When the GOP started the process to impeach President Clinton in 1998 and 1999, he focused public attention on that process, which he said was driven purely by partisan concerns. Republicans said that the president was corrupt. The president responded that Republicans were simply using impeachment for partisan purposes. His approval ratings skyrocketed. The GOP struggled. The second reason is that President Clinton was relentless in his focus on the economy. Clinton, who famously campaigned with ""It's the economy, stupid"" in 1992, never took his eye off the ball.  He continued to hammer away at the recession that he inherited and didn't stop talking about the problems Americans faced. Although Clinton did turn his attention toward health care in 1993 and 1994, he continued to work on the economy, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act. He proposed enterprise zones to try and revitalize urban areas and fought against Republican proposed cuts to key domestic programs. During the rebound of the mid-1990s, Clinton was in a good position to claim credit for the improved circumstances. President Obama has certainly worked hard to improve the economy. In more dramatic fashion than Clinton, he persuaded Congress to pass an economic stimulus bill as well as financial regulation. But too often, President Obama has seemed focused on other concerns, whether it was health care reform in his first two years as president or deficit reduction after the midterm elections. The situation has left many Democrats yearning for a president who understood that economic recovery was the top priority for many in the party. The final reason is that President Clinton displayed a phenomenal ability to show empathy with Americans who were suffering, whether they were struggling with hard economic times or were the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. Although empathy is much different from policy, it was clear that Clinton's ability to forge connections with voters in small groups, or even through speeches, was one of the reasons his polls remained so strong. This has been one of the hardest challenges for the president, who often seems distant and disconnected from the problems facing the country. Obama, a skilled orator, has had trouble connecting to voters at this level. None of this is to ignore the many Democrats who still look back to the Clinton years with a skeptical eye. After all, some Democrats argue that he helped to promote the deregulatory policies that fueled the financial meltdown and that he did little to reverse the growing economic inequality in America. Nonetheless, many aspects of his presidency are attractive in retrospect. For all these reasons, President Clinton is back. The man who often positioned himself against the Clinton legacy is running side by side with him. Besides the campaign for reelection, President Obama should spend some time thinking about what lessons Clinton has to offer this presidency in the final months of his first term -- and in his second term, should that come to pass.

"Obama, talk about political reform with Xi","In contrast to the 2002 farewell summit between President George W. Bush and outgoing Chinese President Jiang Zemin at Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas, this week's talks between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in California mark the first time in history that a U.S. president will host a series of informal meetings with a new Chinese leader.   While issues such as North Korea, cybersecurity and the economy will likely dominate their discussions, what really matters is whether Xi and Obama can establish a trusting personal relationship that will help both leaders overcome stark policy differences.  As charismatic leaders who view themselves as transformational figures, what better way to start the conversation than to outline their aspirations and plans for resolving pressing domestic matters? Both Xi and Obama are finding themselves at political crossroads that will define their subsequent days in office. Both need to solve a confluence of structural problems while confronting cynical constituencies that can easily turn on them.  For Obama, dealing with a seemingly intractable partisan divide in Washington is hard enough. A series of recent bureaucratic problems has made his burden worse, resulting in what some have referred to as his ""second term blues.""  For Xi, an apparent turn to conservatism has the potential to bring his erstwhile reform-minded political honeymoon to an untimely end.  Luckily, each leader has the opportunity this week to talk with one of the few counterparts in the world who can empathize with the magnitude of the issues. In his first few months as president, Xi has worked to give the Chinese government a face-lift, trying to contain corruption and construct a sense of nationalism by offering his people something  they aspire to: the Chinese Dream, or what Xi has described as the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the opportunity to realize a middle-class lifestyle.  As Xi pursues these aspirations, he should join Obama in exploring similar issues that are hindering both countries -- a growing divide between the rich and poor, persistent post-graduate unemployment, housing bubbles, food safety concerns, immigration (or internal migration for China) reform, health care reform and tax reform.  If Xi is to be successful in confronting these issues, it will be difficult to do so without political reform.  In China, dissent has been growing on college campuses, where academics have received recommendations instructing them not to speak about seven sensitive issues: universal values, freedom of the press, civil society, civil rights, past party mistakes, crony capitalism and judicial independence. Whether such official guidelines persist will determine if there is hope for an open and intellectually dynamic political environment that can accommodate socioeconomic changes. As a former professor of constitutional law, Obama is uniquely situated to address the importance of Chinese political reform and constitutionalism. Obama needs to stress that avoiding intellectual discussion of political issues doesn't make them go away—it only pushes such discussion into less structured arenas, and China has seen how that has turned out in the past.  As the first black president, Obama can also candidly and respectfully articulate America's lessons from the civil rights movement and its firm commitment to democracy, human rights, media freedom and the rule of law, which the United States believe to be fundamental to the long-term stability and prosperity of any country. Some might argue that discussion of China's much needed political reform would set Obama and Xi on course for a contentious relationship. In fact, it would help remind Xi that he can seize this moment to stand on the right side of history and turn back from the conservative path before he squanders the reform-minded political capital he has built over his first productive months in office. Instead of focusing solely on specific issues like national security and economic rebalancing, Obama and Xi have an opportunity to set the stage for a deeper, more candid and more cooperative Sino-American relationship by crafting a shared vision of the future and drawing on the common needs and desires of the Chinese and American people.  Only by talking about their domestic challenges and areas for improvement will they realize the potential fruits to be born out of such cooperation. And only when such unity of purpose is realized will China and America be able to work together and tackle the economic and security issues of our time.  Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.

President Obama's law,"President Barack Obama entered office with two overriding legislative goals: health care reform and climate change mitigation. He obtained the first goal but not the second. Now he has to decide whether the laws that Congress passes pose any constraint on his actions, or whether those laws are simply vessels whose precise contents can be filled as the President sees fit. On Tuesday, two federal courts rendered contrasting decisions regarding the legality of subsidies paid to those who have obtained insurance through the federal exchange established under the Affordable Care Act, the Obamacare legislation that a deeply divided Congress passed in 2009.   The act contains a provision authorizing federal subsidies to low-income individuals who purchase insurance through a ""state"" health exchange. The question that the two courts had to answer was whether the specific statutory reference to state exchanges precludes subsidies to those who obtained insurance coverage through the federal exchange.   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 that such subsidies were not permitted; the 4th Circuit, the federal appeals court based in nearby Virginia, held that the subsidies were allowed. The conflicting decisions reflect conflicting views of what counts as the law. According to the D.C. Circuit's majority, the law is contained in the plain language of a statute. But according to the Virginia-based court, the law consists of what Congress intended to do when it enacted the Affordable Care Act.   For its part, the Obama administration emphasizes what Congress intended instead of what Congress actually wrote and passed. When White House press secretary Josh Earnest was asked if ""the letter of the law matters to the White House on this,"" he responded that ""what the courts are charged with doing is evaluating the intent of Congress."" That approach would save the subsidies that underpin the Affordable Care Act, but it would doom the administration's approach to climate change.   When Obama took office, he asked Congress to enact sweeping federal legislation to combat climate change. The President insisted that such new legislation was necessary to respond to climate change -- indeed, some of his more zealous supporters argued that federal climate change legislation was necessary to save the world from destruction. But once Congress rebuffed his plea for such a law, Obama decided that maybe it wasn't necessary after all.   Instead, he turned to the Clean Air Act, which Congress enacted in 1970 to reduce the clouds of air pollution that plagued so many American cities at the time. The intent of the Congress that passed the Clean Air Act was to empower the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate emissions of substances that make people sick when they breathe them.   That Congress did not even think about climate change, and the pollutants that Congress did contemplate are fundamentally different from greenhouse gases that occur naturally in the atmosphere, are not toxic when breathed even at the elevated levels that now exist in the atmosphere, and that cause harm indirectly by facilitating the greenhouse effect that has begun to change the world's climates. If we were to follow Earnest's advice and evaluate the intent of Congress, then the Clean Air Act would not apply to climate change. But the Supreme Court read the Clean Air Act in the same way that the D.C. federal appeals court read the Affordable Care Act. In the landmark 2007 decision of Massachusetts v. EPA, the high court held the clear text of the Clean Air Act encompassed all sorts of air pollutants, not just those that were in the mind of Congress when it enacted the law. That broad understanding of the Clean Air Act forms the legal foundation for the EPA's ongoing regulation of greenhouse gas emitters and of Obama's Climate Action Plan.   Now Obama, a former adjunct law professor, faces a choice. If he defends efforts to interpret the Affordable Care Act based on what Congress apparently intended rather than on the law's actual provisions, then he undercuts the legal theory for his response to climate change. But if he defers to what the law actually says, then he loses the subsidies that are integral to the success of the Affordable Care Act.   Of course, the President could simply advance whatever legal theory suits his policy aims. We expect more from judges. And few judges have articulated the judicial task better than Oliver Wendell Holmes, who remarked, ""We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means."" Even if Josh Earnest would prefer otherwise.   Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion."
Elizabeth Warren vs. Hillary Clinton is a false choice,"Over the past week, speculation emerged that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton might not be the only prominent Democrat running for the nomination for president in 2016. Her ""inevitable"" path to the nomination is once again being questioned.  In The New Republic, Noam Scheiber launched the debate with an article titled, ""Hillary's Nightmare? A Democratic Party That Realizes Its Soul Lies With Elizabeth Warren."" Scheiber focuses on the possibility of the Massachusetts senator running on a campaign centering on the issues of economic inequality, restoring the middle class and regulating Wall Street.  ""What we need is a system,"" Warren has said, ""that puts an end to the boom and bust cycle. A system that recognizes we don't grow this country from the financial sector; we grow this country from the middle class."" Comparing such a contest to the race between Barack Obama and Clinton in the 2008 primaries, the article suggests that Warren could re-energize liberal Democrats who feel disillusioned by the past five years. Watching this unfold, some commentators have predicted that a civil war might be brewing between the progressive and moderate wings of the party.  David Frum, the insightful commentator and CNN contributor who has been a prominent critic of what tea party Republicans have done to his GOP, warned that ""where Democrats have scored successes since 2010, those successes have been owed less to Occupy-style militancy, and much more to the seeming unquenchable determination of Republicans to render themselves unelectable.""  Competition within the party doesn't have to be a negative; Democrats could turn this to an advantage that helps candidates who enter the race to focus and refine their message about the economy in a way that would make for a powerful campaign theme.  It would be a mistake for Democrats to think that the entry of Warren, or a candidate similar to Warren, into the race would somehow create problems or even a ""left-center"" divide.  The notion that dealing with economic inequality represents the ""progressive"" wing of the party as opposed to the mainstream is an extremely flawed way for Democrats to think of their party. Painting Warren's concerns as being to the left ignores how tackling these kinds of economic challenges have been at the heart of the Democratic Party for almost a century. Mainstream Democrats have usually done best when they have kept their eye on these questions and put forth policies that address the problem of middle class security. During the 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt made this the centerpiece of his New Deal. Most of his policies centered on providing economic support, such as creating old age pensions, protecting unions and providing unemployment compensation as well as creating public jobs to help Americans make it through the crisis of the Great Depression and to serve as a foundation for their future.  The policies revolved around a vision of ""moral capitalism,"" according to the historian Lizabeth Cohen. His programs proved to have widespread appeal and provided the foundation for a durable coalition of industrial workers, farmers, progressive activists and African-Americans that would last for decades.  During the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson continued along these lines by tackling the problem of economic inequality through programs that aimed to bolster the strength and size of the middle class. The war on poverty sought to help the poor become self-sufficient  and  enter the marketplace.  Medicare guaranteed that middle-class families could count on health insurance when they retired and wouldn't be overwhelmed by medical costs of their parents. Federal education assistance offered affordable loans to Americans who wanted to attend college and money for local schools to ensure that all children received an adequate education. Food stamps provided food security for struggling families. Civil rights laws gave African-Americans access to public space, employment opportunities and voting rights that were central to full citizenship. While Republicans rebounded as controversy over Vietnam and the war on poverty grew, the programs in fact survived and remained quite popular. Republicans have either learned to live with them and, in some cases, have expanded them.  Democrats in Congress were often able to succeed in the Age of Reagan by fighting back against Republicans who try to dismantle the welfare state.  Starting in 1982, Democrats regained their footing in the House of Representatives during the midterm elections based on campaigns about economic fairness. When congressional Republicans conducted a full-scale assault on Medicare and other programs in 1995, President Bill Clinton stood his ground and rebounded to a landslide r-election victory the following year. Indeed, Clinton, usually tagged as a hard-core centrist, devoted considerable energy to the cause of middle-class America. In his 1992 campaign, he hammered away at President George H.W. Bush for his inability to deal with the recession and failure to sympathize with the economic concerns of average Americans.  While Clinton couldn't persuade Congress to pass his health care reform that aimed to broaden access and lower costs in the insurance system, he did find support for smaller measures, such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, that have proved to be popular. Despite the characterization of Hillary Clinton as a market-based centrist, she has frequently addressed these themes throughout her career, including while in the Senate, and in 2008 made it clear that she would be a president who fought for the middle class.  While Clinton, as her critics have said, has ties to the financial community and is not in any way an opponent of big business or big finance, she has also been a strong defender of the social safety net and programs that help the middle class grow.    In 1978, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy warned his party about veering too far to the center under President Jimmy Carter.  In words that Democrats should heed, Kennedy said: ""We are heirs to a great tradition in American public life. Our party took up the cause of jobs for the unemployed in the Great Depression. Our party took up the cause of civil rights for black and brown Americans, and the cause of equal rights for women in America and the people of the District of Columbia.""  Although Kennedy did not win the nomination in 1980 (for many reasons outside of his policies), his speech offers an important message for Democrats thinking about 2016. It would be a mistake for Democrats to break off into opposing camps, with some tackling these so-called ""leftward"" issues and others sticking to the ""center."" A better bet, based on the record, would be to put these questions front and center in the primaries and see which candidate offers the best and most aggressive response to the challenges that have faced middle-class Americans in recent decades.

"On health care, GOP has a promise (and a deadline) to keep","There's nothing like the prospect of President Trump making deals with Democrats to light a fire under the GOP.   This week's renewed Republican support for the Graham-Cassidy bill is a sign that they are ready to repeal and replace Obamacare and deliver on seven years of their campaign promises.  Ever since Democrats rammed Obamacare through Congress, they have fought tooth and nail to protect it. According to a recent poll conducted by Politico and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, GOP voters have made it clear that it is long past time we reject the status quo and find a lasting solution that solves the health care crisis that many say Obamacare caused.   This bill, while not perfect, is in so many ways the middle ground that Republicans and Democrats alike have been calling for.   Its genesis was a conversation in the Senate barber shop between Sen. Lindsey Graham and former  Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pennsylvania) back in the spring. Sen. Santorum has been working behind the scenes to help draft the bill and garner support from GOP holdouts.  Action on Graham-Cassidy is imperative before September 30, the Senate's deadline to use the budget reconciliation process to pass health care legislation using a simple majority. If Republicans want to take this necessary step toward undoing the damage caused by Obamacare, they have until then to do so without running the risk of being blocked by a partisan filibuster.  To continue to kick the can down the road -- as Congress has done over the last several years -- would be a complete abdication of duty by the lawmakers people in this country have entrusted to fix this problem. As I heard on the campaign trail during the 2016 presidential campaign, health care reform is a top priority for working Americans.  The crux of Obamacare's failure was hubris; Democrats had the audacity to presume that Washington knew better than states and individuals when it came to the diversity of patient needs across the country.   The most promising feature of the Graham-Cassidy bill is that is turns that premise around and gives control back to state governors to decide the best way to fund health care in their states. By annually providing funds with block grants, this bill would give states the flexibility to address the unique needs of their residents. It shouldn't shock anyone that the needs of the uninsured in Michigan, for example, might be vastly different from the needs of patients in a state like Texas, with different populations and statewide factors impacting the cost and availability of medical treatment. This bill also prioritizes the needs of small businesses by removing the Obamacare individual and employer mandates that some observe have crippled growth and killed jobs. Graham-Cassidy also repeals some of the onerous taxes and regulations imposed by Obamacare, expands the limits on health savings accounts and makes good on the promise to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. While the Obamacare regulations governing pre-existing conditions would be waived, states would still be required to provide coverage to everyone. There's no reason the Senate should not be able to get this done, yet some senators are unwisely still dragging their feet. In a strong show of just how important it is this bill gets passed, the Trump administration has dispatched Vice President Mike Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to work with the Senate this week. It's urgent to get this done and a chart a new course for the millions of Americans who cannot afford coverage for their families and face uncertainty as they watch Obamacare collapse.   The latest estimates project more than 45% of the counties in America could have a single insurer or none next year, and the CBO expects premiums to rise another 15% -- on top of the 105% increase we've seen in 20 states over the last four years. Saddling families with unaffordable premiums and leaving nearly half the country with no choice shows this failed, partisan law has become the problem, not the solution. It's past time our senators take action and make this change our country needs. It's time for the promises made to become promises kept."
"Patience, Obamacare will work","You know what's relatively easy? Fixing a website. You know what's really hard? Ensuring access to affordable, quality health insurance for every single American and improving our broken health care system in the process. In the back-and-forth about the Obamacare exchange websites, let's not lose sight of the ultimate goal of health care reform -- a goal that, even with the exchanges problems, we are steadily achieving. Less than 17 days into the signup period, the State of Oregon had already enrolled 56,000 people under the Medicaid expansion in Obamacare -- and reduced the state's percentage of uninsured by 10%. In New York, over 150,000 people have signed up for a private insurance plan through the state's exchange website -- including, by the way, me. In Kentucky, a state that has more than 640,000 residents without health insurance, the state insurance exchange is signing up 1,000 people per day, ""a great rate and a great success so far"" says Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear.  In Washington State, 31,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid coverage, 4,500 have enrolled in private health plans and an additional 56,000 state residents have completed applications. Other states, especially those that worked to implement their own insurance exchanges and expand Medicaid under the health reform law, are seeing similar success -- contrasted with those states that have, mainly for ideological reasons, sabotaged implementation.  And even still, the increased access to insurance through private market exchanges and Medicaid expansion is only one aspect of the larger reform law.   Already, 3.4 million young Americans have been able to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26. Already, millions of Americans have benefited from the ban on insurance companies denying coverage because of preexisting conditions, a ban that will take full effect next year. Already, we're all benefiting from the law ending lifetime and annual limits on the amount of coverage health insurance provides, and ending the practice of insurance companies' arbitrarily canceling coverage in the wake of catastrophic illness.  The Obamacare exchange websites can run fast as lightning or slow as molasses but, regardless, these reforms are already helping millions of Americans automatically. No hitting reset required.   It's also helpful to put the exchange websites into some perspective. We're a little over one-tenth of the way through the current enrollment period. People have until December 15 to complete their applications if they want coverage to begin on January 1, 2014. And then we all have until February 15, 2014 to enroll in private insurance coverage before being subject to the individual mandate penalty.   According to psychology studies, 20% of Americans are chronic procrastinators. At least 95% of Americans say they procrastinate regularly. Plus, to be clear, picking among multiple health insurance options is a bit more complicated than buying a new T-shirt. So if millions of Americans are waiting until the last second to enroll in Obamacare, we shouldn't just chalk that up to the law's failure or website problems but to inevitable human nature. The good news is, by the time most people seeking insurance get around to enrolling, whether by December 15 or February 15, the website kinks will undoubtedly have long been ironed out.   eBay wasn't built in a day. And neither was any major government initiative. From Social Security to Medicare to the Peace Corps to the income tax, other significant government programs were initially as overrun with snafus as they were with critiques. But eventually, employers figured out how to include workers' names and Social Security numbers in their earnings reports and the website for Medicare Part D was successfully debugged.   A few geeks locked in a room with a case of Mountain Dew will fix the Obamacare websites. But all the computer programmers and pundits and conservative nay-sayers in the land couldn't fix the fact that, three years ago, our health care costs were skyrocketing, tens of millions of Americans lacked health insurance and 14,000 more were losing their coverage every day. We needed a law to fix that. Thankfully, we now have one.  And whatever the ups and downs of the websites, the Affordable Care Act is working. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Will Romney lurch to the center?,"With the inevitability of Mitt Romney's GOP presidential nomination now assured, the next question looming in this long, twisted election cycle is likely to be this: Which Mitt Romney will be running against President Barack Obama? In a perfect Mitt World, Romney would have been able to stay in his comfort zone, touting his economic prowess vs. the nation's (read: Obama's) economic failures. But a covey of conservative Republican opponents fueled with super PAC money and jazzed by tea party frenzy forced him from the middle and into an increasingly conservative persona, culminating in his somewhat plaintive declaration that he was ""severely"" conservative. With his need to compete for the Republican right now ebbing, will Romney migrate back to the center, hoping that a good shake of the Etch A Sketch will create a clean slate to start courting moderates and independents? He can only wish it were that easy.  There is little doubt that Romney, like most presidential candidates before him, will recast his message for a general election. His problem in doing so, however, is his well-established record as a political chameleon who changes colors to match the polemics of his strongest political rival. In a weird through-the-looking-glass transformation that echoes through Romney's political career, Mitt the candidate often takes on some of the positions and personality traits of his opponents. When he challenged Ted Kennedy for the U.S. Senate seat in 1994, Romney became Moderate Mitt, staking out a painfully sincere middle ground stance on abortion. Watching him in debate with Kennedy, viewers can be excused for thinking they have wandered into an earlier ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. Romney's tortured answer wiggles one way -- he says he will support and defend Roe v. Wade -- then wiggles the other by saying his family, including his mom, had its own beliefs ""but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. And you will not see me wavering on that."" Kennedy puts it more simply. ""I support pro-choice,"" he says. ""My opponent is multiple choice."" The line drew a burst of applause. Romney ran a similar campaign for governor in 2002, modeling the same moderate positions of the two liberal Republican governors who preceded him. He took the same tortured tack on abortion as in 1994; his campaign courted Log Cabin Republicans, promising, according to members who attended a meeting, to be a supporter of gay rights and to stay out of the gay marriage case making its way through the state courts.   There was little change in his political stance in the first year of his governorship. No social initiatives came out of the governor's office. Most of his work revolved around the annual budget process, a Beacon Hill ritual in which the governor, Republican or Democrat, presents a budget to the Massachusetts legislature, which quickly dismantles the plan and replaces it with its own agenda, overriding any eventual veto attempts by the governor.  Then came two events that forced the governor out of his comfort zone of moderation. The first was the state's Supreme Judicial Court's 2003 ruling that a ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. With his eyes already set on the White House, Romney faced the unplanned prospect of running for president as the governor from the first same-sex marriage state in the union.  Fortunately for him, however, he had no real constitutional power to do anything other than to act as a sideline cheerleader for a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed civil unions but not same-sex marriage. The amendment eventually failed in the legislature.  In the meantime, Romney did some executive huffing and puffing, summoning up a dusty 1914 miscegenation statute that barred out-of-state couples from marrying in Massachusetts if their union was prohibited at home. The order was dropped after municipal clerks complained about the extra work it would bring. But mostly Romney was able to use rhetoric to play to conservatives while taking no action that would offend the liberals. Perhaps the more significant, and less noted, event that forced Romney to switch his protective coloring was the resignation in September 2004 of House Speaker Tom Finneran, a staunch social conservative who ruled the Massachusetts House with an iron hand. A singular power in the legislature, Finneran controlled all action in the House, keeping liberal proposals from advancing out of committee. With Finneran as sentinel, Romney was spared from making any decisions on legislation that could haunt him in Republican primaries.   Finneran's departure in advance of federal obstruction of justice charges -- he eventually pleaded guilty -- forced Romney to drop his Massachusetts Mitt persona. With a more liberal Democratic speaker in place, who is now doing time in federal prison, Romney had no place to hide as hot-button issues such as stem cell research, the morning-after pill and various bills on sexual orientation rights escaped the legislature and made it onto his desk. He faced a turning point. Sign those bills and safeguard his position for another run for governor or oppose them to curry favor with the more conservative Republican voters he would need to win a presidential nomination. He chose the latter, beginning his long public transformation to Severely Conservative Mitt. Even back then, reporters covering the Massachusetts State House could anticipate carefully crafted statements by Romney on any social issue likely to come up when he shared the dais with Republican presidential primary rivals.  His one major legacy as governor -- the health care reform bill for which Massachusetts Democrats now honor him -- was part of that same Romney political calculus.  When he collaborated with the Democratic leadership to pass the law, the central fixture of individual mandate was within a general Republican ideology for reforming health care. But Romney's dream of being the savior of the health care crisis became a nightmare when conservatives demonized a Democratic president for the same legislation. Romney couldn't get a break from his Massachusetts legacy. In the last two years of his governorship, Romney was out of state campaigning for president more often than he was in his State House office. His campaign patter often included digs at liberal Massachusetts, such as the time he described himself as ""a vegetarian at a cattle ranch."" The tactic didn't increase the love in Massachusetts. In March 2005, he had a 55-to-41 favorable to unfavorable rating. Those numbers continued to decline over the next two years. By November 2006, as his term was ending, his numbers dropped to 37-to-52 favorable to unfavorable. Only 29% said they would vote for him again.  Some say Romney's shifting persona is nothing new to American politics. Even Abraham Lincoln tailored his message to the audience or electorate he was trying to woo. But the politicians who win elections and leave legacies keep to core ideals. Romney may have such ideals tucked away in a lockbox, but who can tell? His often ham-handed attempts to win over whatever demographic he is targeting this week creates a stink of insincerity that trails him even when he actually means what he says.  That will be the problem for whichever Romney we see over the next months. Whatever message he chooses, part of the audience will wonder if the Mitt Romney they are seeing will be the same one they might vote for.

A health care victory that's only a start,"Chief Justice Roberts, in a move that likely surprised many, joined the four more liberal justices in declaring that the mandate could survive, but as a tax. (For those of you following along, I made that argument here at CNN.com a number of months ago.) News: What the health care ruling means to you In some ways, politically, this may have been what the president and Congress wanted, but couldn't get. They feared making the mandate a tax back when they were passing health care reform. That was because ""tax"" is a four-letter word in American discourse. So instead, they made it a penalty. But the court decided it was a tax anyway, meaning that Democrats got their desired outcome without having to make an undesirable argument. Since the mandate is constitutional under taxing power, the other arguments related to it went away. The court did not have to rule on the regulations, and that means the other parts of the ACA that deal with insurance and the exchanges were left untouched. The ""doughnut hole"" remains, the cost-control measures remain, and so does everything else. Read the court ruling (.PDF) The other notable news had to do with the Medicaid expansion. As part of insuring millions of Americans, the ACA declared that everyone in the US up to 133% of the poverty line, regardless of marital or parental status, would now qualify for Medicaid. This is an enormous increase in the Medicaid population, and is expected to cover about half of the newly insured in 2014. Originally, the ACA stated that if states refused to comply with the expansion, they would lose all Medicaid funding, even that which they already had. Those fighting the expansion argued that was coercive. The Supreme Court partially agreed today. It ruled that the federal government can offer states money for the expansion. It can refuse them the extra money if they deny the expansion. But it can't take back the old funding if they don't comply. News: Breaking down the court's decision Some will see this as a partial victory for the states. But I think few states in the end will opt not to take the money. The federal government is picking up the entire tab for the expansion for a number of years. It will be very hard for governors to turn to their constituents and explain that they are refusing free money from the feds to give them health care insurance. News: What Justices wrote, how they voted I'd caution you, however, to take all of this with some equanimity. Health care reform is far from over. Regardless of your political persuasion, there are many reasons not to celebrate. The truth of the matter is that our health care system is still a mess. At last count, there were about 50 million Americans who lacked insurance for all of last year. More than 7 million of them are children. Millions more lacked insurance for part of the year. Millions more are underinsured, meaning that illness could still ruin them financially, if they can afford treatment at all. Yes, the ACA will reduce that number, but not to zero. More than 20 million Americans will likely remain uninsured. Even if you have insurance, access is still terrible. Almost 20% of people in the United States report having to wait six days or more if they are sick. Fewer people in the United States think that their doctor spends enough time with than any comparable country. Fewer people think their doctor knows important information about them as well. Our information systems are abysmal. As of last year, only one-third of physicians reported that they have a functioning electronic medical record system that met the criteria for a ""basic"" system.  The United States still has the highest infant mortality of any nation we'd want to compare ourselves to. If you think infant mortality is rigged, then you still have to acknowledge that we have the highest maternal mortality. That's right -- more mothers die in childbirth every year in the United States than any other comparable country. The mortality rates for a host of diseases are shockingly high. We have fewer doctors per population than any other comparable country. We have fewer hospital beds per population than any other comparable country.  News: Ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides? I haven't even gotten to the cost yet.  We spent about $2.7 trillion on health care last year. That's almost 18% of GDP. That's more than $8,600 for every person in the United States. And since we know there are lots of people who get little to no care, that means that the rest of us are spending an insane amount. While it makes sense that we should spend more money than other countries, as we're richer than almost all of them, we're still spending way more than you'd expect given our ""wealth"". It's likely that the Affordable Care Act will help with many of these problems. It won't, however, solve them entirely. In many ways, getting more people insurance was the easiest part of fixing the health care system. Getting costs down will be much harder. Improving quality even more so. But we have to do it.  It's time we got started. News: Timeline of the health care law  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Worried about Obamacare? Fear not,"With just two weeks before the health care exchanges open and the Affordable Care Act really kicks in, the only thing that's clear about the law is that Americans are totally confused about what it does. Two polls released this week paint a dismal picture for those of us who consider it our job to explain what health care reform means to the public. The first, from the Wall Street Journal and NBC News, showed that almost 70% of people don't understand what Obamacare is or that they understand only a part of it. While 31% thought it was a good idea, 44% thought it was a bad one. The remaining 25% weren't sure.  It gets worse. When the poll specifically looked at the uninsured -- which Obamacare is specifically designed to help -- more than three-quarters of them said they didn't understand how the law would affect them.  Another poll, from the Pew Research Center and USA Today, found that 53% of Americans disapprove of Obamacare, compared with 42% who approve. In this poll, though, only a third said they had little or no understanding of how the law would affect them. Almost half of people thought that health exchanges would not be available in their state.   While Obamacare is complicated, our understanding of it doesn't have to be so. This is what Obamacare will do: Most Americans already get health insurance from their jobs, Medicaid, Medicare or the Department of Veterans Affairs. The vast majority of those people will continue to do so.  But starting in 2014, people without health insurance will get insured in one of two ways. If they are very poor -- making less than 133% of the poverty line -- then they will get Medicaid through the expansion of the program. That is, if their state has opted to participate in the program. If their state has not, then they may continue to be uninsured.  The rest of the people without health insurance will go to the exchanges to get it. There, they can choose from plans with different levels of co-payments and deductibles, according to how much they want to spend. If they make less than 400% of the poverty line, they will get a tax credit or subsidy to help with the cost.  No one can be denied health insurance anymore, and no one can be charged more for being sick. All the plans are from private insurance, and they're going to compete for your business. Complete coverage: Health care in America There are other bells and whistles, but that's Obamacare in a nutshell.  If you ask me, I think Obamacare will do more good than harm. Many uninsured Americans are unable to get insurance in the market as it exists today, especially if they have chronic conditions. Those who can afford to often pay a fortune for it. Obamacare is a solution to these problems.   While a relatively small number of people will see their rates go up, they're mostly young, healthy people making more than 400% of the poverty line. The vast majority -- more than 90% of people getting their insurance in the exchanges -- will get subsidies to make their insurance more affordable. Plus, now everyone, even if they're young and healthy at the moment, will be protected if they or a member of their family gets sick or when they grow old.   There are places you can go right now to get more information. For instance, you can visit www.healthcare.gov. At that website, by answering a few questions, you can see what options will be available to you starting October 1. After that date, you will be taken to your state's exchange, where you will be able to get actual information about plans and sign up for them. Coverage will start January 1. Originally, Obamacare was expected to come with more than half a billion dollars to be spent on outreach and education efforts about the exchanges. This money was supposed to be used to help people understand how Obamacare was supposed to work for everyone. But the Republican-led House of Representatives cut the whole implementation budget.  When Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius was further forced to move what little money remained in the PR budget into the Prevention Public Health Fund (which was also cut), Sen. Max Baucus, one of the main architects of Obamacare, got upset. He remarked that the law was complicated and that we would get a ""train wreck."" Many leapt on this comment and proclaimed that even Baucus thought the law was a mess. But that's not what he said. He meant that if people didn't understand how it worked, then it would be a mess.  At the moment, his prediction could still come true. The latest polls show that, as he feared, too few people understand how Obamacare functions. But there's still time. It will take a lot of outreach and a lot of elbow grease, but supporters of the law believe they are up to the task.  Time will tell. October 1 is approaching fast.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Why Democrats should welcome Sanders' entry into presidential race,"As a rule of thumb, being called a socialist isn't a good thing in American politics. But if you're brave enough to describe yourself that way? Well, that might be enough to take a little bit of the sting out of your opponents' attacks.  That, at least, is what U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont must be hoping. And by describing himself as a ""democratic socialist,"" Sanders is showing a willingness to jump right in and wrestle with some of the big issues facing this country -- and he's doing his party a big favor in the process. Of course, Sanders is actually an independent who caucuses with the Democrats in the U.S. Senate. In that chamber, he has been a champion for the working poor and a fierce protector of the middle class, arguing in favor of collective bargaining rights for working men and women. He has also fought to create jobs and for policies that will spur the sort of economic growth that enables all Americans to succeed.  In Sanders' mind, the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a major piece of the Obama administration's economic agenda -- is not one of those growth policies. ""At a time when our middle class is disappearing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, this anti-worker legislation must be defeated,"" he said. ""If we are serious about rebuilding the middle class and creating the millions of good paying jobs we desperately need, we must fundamentally rewrite our trade policies. NO to fast track, and NO to the TPP."" By pushing back against the party he is so often aligned with, Sanders will force Democratic candidates such as former secretary of state and U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton to more clearly define exactly what their stances are on specific issues. And while that's the last thing any politician truly wants to do, it's something every voter should want. And the reality is that it's good for Clinton as well as for democracy to have a really strong debate on how to keep America safe and make it stronger, including on issues such as protecting our environment, strengthening the middle class and growing our economy.   Sanders takes aim at Wall Street in presidential launch One of my good friends who worked with me on the Al Gore campaign is now advising Sanders. While he understands this is an uphill battle, the Clinton campaign cannot take this nomination for granted. True, Sanders' odds of winning the Democratic nomination are long, to say the least -- the latest polls show Clinton way out in front of any alternative to her. But Sanders won't be the only one working to make sure that the Democratic Party offers voters the kind of debate on the issues that this country needs.  Later this week, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley will join the fray. O'Malley has scheduled a ""special announcement"" for May 30, and in the world of politics, we all know that announcing the announcement IS the announcement. But until then, this is Sanders' moment. And the early signs are that despite the long odds, he might be poised to make the most of it. ""I have worked for him for many years, and he is a very serious candidate. We have already seen him break from the pack at the bottom in a number of polls,"" senior political strategist Tad Devine told me. ""In Iowa and New Hampshire, he has moved into the upper double digits in several polls. In Washington State, there were two polls last week where he had moved into the 20s in the Democratic primary. We have raised millions online in the last couple of weeks, and I think we will have the resources to run a real campaign."" Maybe middle class voters are less worried about labels than they are about getting things done. And that starts with a serious discussion of potential solutions. ""The Democratic Party appreciates the contributions that Sen. Sanders, Secretary Clinton and other candidates will make to a healthy dialogue about the future of our party and our nation,"" DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said last month. ""There is a distinct contrast between Democrats who are on the side of middle and working class families and Republicans who are concerned with the very rich and wealthy corporations. Over the next year, the discussions we have during our respective nominating processes will help make that choice clear."" And there will be plenty of discussions to have on many policies: the economy, health care reform, criminal justice reform, immigration and the ISIS threat.  Every time a Democratic candidate, or potential candidate, gets out there in front of the press or engages with voters, they have the chance to talk about real solutions for the very real problems that the American people face each and every day. And while it might feel a little uncomfortable sometimes having to get specific about what you would do if you're elected, voters will appreciate the contrast between serious debate and the kind of character attacks that will be coming from the Republican field.  The American people are starting to notice that one party is more interested in picking a fight rather than fighting on their behalf. Now that the Democratic candidate has become candidates, I think voters will be grateful that they are getting a real choice. And that is good for Democrats' chances in 2016 -- whoever they end up choosing.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.   Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine."
It's not easy being first lady,"In ""The Obamas,"" the new book causing a stir with its speculation about the extent of the first lady's political influence, author Jodi Kantor recounts an anecdote: A young schoolgirl tells Michelle Obama that she hopes to someday become a president's wife herself one day. ""Doesn't pay well,"" Mrs. Obama wittily cracks. Truth be told, pay is the least of the drawbacks of being a first lady. The unelected, unaccountable and unofficial position has been challenging presidential spouses for more than two centuries now. I've spent years researching and interviewing first ladies, but it was Hillary Clinton who best crystallized for me the essential reality of what it means to be first lady: ""Who I really am as a person is ultimately less important to the public than what they want me to represent as a persona.""  This was as true for mental health care reform advocate Rosalynn Carter in the 1970s as it was for the happy hostess Julia Grant a century earlier. Michelle Obama articulated her own frustration with this the other day, for seeming, she said, to have been cast as ""some kind of angry black woman."" There is truth in Mrs. Obama's observation; her historic status as the first African-American first lady has made her at times a target for unfair stereotype and very ugly treatment.  But casting the first lady as ""the other"" -- that is, outside the concept of the Anglo-Saxon as acceptably ""American"" -- has a long history.  Almost a century ago, when the press widely reported that Edith Wilson was from the ""Red Bolling family,"" as the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Princess Pocahontas, even serious journalists ignored the fact that it meant only one of her 512 ninth-generation ancestors was a Native American. Instead, it prompted members of the public to send her Native American items like a beaded belt and write to government officials warning that it was illegal for the first lady to be served alcohol.  As late as the 1960 election, when the Catholicism of Democratic presidential candidate John F. Kennedy finally broke through the nation's historic anti-papist sentiment, the campaign of his opponent, Richard Nixon, soft-pedaled his wife's ethnic and religious background. Not only was Pat Nixon the daughter of a German immigrant mother, but also of an Irish Catholic father.  Kennedy's campaign may not have been able to conceal that Jacqueline Kennedy was Catholic too, but at least her ""Bouvier"" maiden name offered legitimate exotic cover for the larger reality of her background: She had only one French paternal great-grandparent, and her ""Lee of Virginia"" mother was not of the famous blue-blood clan, but rather had briefly lived in the Old Dominion for a college term and was as Irish as the Kennedys.  Mamie Eisenhower? Despite her widely distributed Swedish Christmas cookie recipe, even she never acknowledged  her grandparents as immigrants from Sweden.  At other points, societal judgments of the first ladies served well as veiled partisan attacks on their husbands. In an earlier time, the worldly, abolitionist Mary Lincoln of the wealthy Kentucky Todd clan would have been idealized as a Southern belle hostess. But married to the Union's president during the Civil War, she was maliciously caricatured as a racist secretly loyal to the Confederacy.  And William McKinley, realizing that disclosure of his wife Ida's epilepsy would fix her with a label of ""insanity,"" avoided the ignorant presumption by asserting that she was an ""invalid,"" as evidenced by her use of a wheelchair or cane.  The 1828 campaign editorials shaming Rachel Jackson as morally unfit because her first marriage had ended in divorce were central to the character attacks on her husband, Andrew Jackson. Nearly 100 years later, such judgment was still so strongly feared for its political liability that Florence Harding outright lied to the press with her claim of having been widowed by her first husband, not divorced. By 1976, however, Betty Ford's first marriage ending in divorce was not an issue, and neither was the earlier divorce of presidential candidate Ronald Reagan. As time moves on and American life and demographics evolve, so too will the perceptions of wives in the White House. However, hurtful remarks or hateful racism aimed at the current first lady may feel to Americans of many different backgrounds so shaming as to force a tipping point in history. One can hope it will finally help reduce the rhetoric of future generations about presidential spouses based on their origins, appearance  -- even gender.

Don't repeal Americans' health care lifeline,"I had been wrestling with eye redness for weeks. After trying nearly every brand of over-the-counter eyedrops available, I finally decided to see a doctor. A handful of tests later, the doctor told me he had no idea why my eyes were red. But that didn't stop him from giving me a prescription.  It was odd he would assign a treatment without a diagnosis, but what choice did I have? Visine was not getting this red out, and well, he is a doctor. So I paid the co-pay and bought the prescription. After it ran out and I still had red eyes, I went to visit another doctor.  He also ran a couple of tests. He also had no idea why my eyes were red. He also gave me a prescription. Hundreds of dollars spent, and yet I still have no answers or clearer eyes. But I do have an appointment with a third doctor and an allergist.  I'm not sharing this story  to complain. I'm sharing because if you know the average American makes only $33,000 a year -- which, adjusted for inflation, has not changed since 1988 -- or if you know the price of COBRA for a family of four, then you also know why a lot of Americans don't even bother to get on this hamster wheel. They can't afford to do it.   Medicine is not an exact science; I get that. But what I don't get is what middle-class and working-poor people are supposed to do as they ricochet helplessly between doctors without getting answers -- like pinballs in a business model that thrives on people trying to find out what's wrong.  How do you keep from getting cynical when you know managing an illness is more profitable than curing it or that leaner cuts of meat and organic produce are more expensive than fattier cuts and produce sprayed with chemicals? Nearly one in four children in the United States lives in poverty, and the World Health Organization reports a direct correlation between socioeconomic status and health.  So why is the conversation about health, and specifically, health care reform, so toxic?  And so politicized?  President Theodore Roosevelt said, ""No country can be strong whose people are poor and sick.""  Yet the promise each GOP candidate has made is to repeal what he or she calls ""Obamacare,"" with no alternative.  Are  we meant to pretend the impetus behind the law no longer exists because there's a new sheriff in town?  To even call health care reform ""Obamacare"" redirects the conversation away from the most important point: The correlation between socioeconomic status and the mortality rate. Obama doesn't need health care. He and his wife ,Michelle, and their children have access to the best health care on the planet. The same is true for his well-heeled challengers, such as Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Mitt Romney, as well as many of the people in Congress who are fortunate enough to be in the top 10 % of the nation's earners. They all have access to outstanding health care.  But what about you? When was the last time you've been to the dentist? You see, despite the rhetoric, the need for health care reform was not discovered by President Barack Obama in 2009. It did not come from Hillary Clinton in 1992.  Each president, going back as far as Teddy Roosevelt, has talked about the need to address access to and administration of health care. They understood a healthy population is the lifeblood of a country.  Any politician who is touting repeal without offering something significant in its place is not only incapable of connecting the dots, but is out of touch with the kind of sacrifices people make in their health decisions every day. Things such as ignoring reoccurring pains and unusual growths because they can't afford the doctor visit or even the prescription co-pay.   This week, CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired a riveting story about homeless families living in cars in central Florida. One untouched topic was the health of the parents. I wondered what would happen to those children if their parents were to succumb to an illness? Would they end up in the state system? If so, who do you think pays for that?  It's all connected, and a true leader sees that. Mississippi is the the poorest state in the country. It is also the unhealthiest.  Most of the 10 poorest states are among the 10 unhealthiest states. They also tend to vote Republican.  Don't get mad at me; I'm just the messenger. The question is:  What are GOP candidates saying when they promise to repeal health care reform but are silent on health care and poverty?   The health care reform plan is not perfect.  But the Constitution wasn't perfect either, which is why we have amendments. The best thing for the national dialogue is to point out what's good about the plan so we have something to build on. In nearly 80 years of the White House talking about health care reform, we finally have something. And we need it. Promising to repeal the whole thing might be good for the polls, but what does it do for the people?   Because I can promise you, any new president who repeals the law will still have access to the best health care available. That is not true for all of the people who voted that president in. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter"
Why you shouldn't vote for Obama,"It has been said that a democratic republic such as ours is a do-it-yourself enterprise. People change the course of this country through conversation, debate and, eventually, consensus. As the 2012 elections near, these debates, particularly the upcoming presidential and vice presidential debates, take center stage. In light of what has been a long and tumultuous political season, here are my strongest arguments for Mitt Romney, Rep. Paul Ryan, and fellow conservatives to explain to their fellow Americans why President Barack Obama does not deserve a second term. Obama's handling of the economy: The U.S. is mired in the midst of the worst recovery since the Great Depression: 43 straight months of unemployment over 8%. The unemployment rate when Barack Obama took office was 7.8% and today it is 8.1%. Worse, the labor force is shrinking to record lows. People are giving up looking for work. In August the labor force participation rate fell to 63.5%, its lowest level since September 1981. For men, the August participation rate in the labor force was 69.8%. That's the lowest ever on record. Furthermore, half of all recent college graduates are underemployed or unemployed. Since Obama took office, median household income has declined more than $4,000.  More people are on food stamps than ever before -- 46.7 million. The poverty rate is around 15%, the highest since 1993. The average retail price of gasoline has more than doubled under Obama, rising from $1.84 per gallon to more than $3.80 per gallon. In spite of this, he stopped the approval of the Keystone pipeline for further review. Opinion: Obama on world stage -- more hope than change? Obama inherited a bad economy, but his policies have made it even worse. The $800 billion stimulus package failed, according to the standards promised by an Obama administration economist. With Democrats in control of Congress, Obama then spent the next two years of his political capital on health care reform. Subsequently, the nation, mired in a debt crisis, underwent its first-ever credit downgrade. With our national debt exceeding $16 trillion, he has offered no credible plan for the nation's long term fiscal health. Our country is hurtling toward a fiscal cliff in January 2013. Foreign policy: Obama ascended to the presidency promising a new era of American foreign policy. Apart from the killing of Osama bin Laden, the death of Moammar Gaddafi and and the successful expansion of drone strikes, the foreign policy record of this administration has largely been one of capitulation, indecision and weakness. In the first true foreign policy test of his presidency, Obama failed to back the pro-democracy Green Revolution in Iran, saying he didn't want to ""be seen as meddling."" The uprising was crushed. Tell us: Do you know who's getting your vote? When the Arab Spring erupted, the president then decided to meddle in Egypt, calling for Hosni Mubarak to step down. Today, a country that was once a valuable Middle East ally is under the majority control of the Muslim Brotherhood. But when the Arab Spring spread to Syria, a longtime proxy of Iran, he didn't intervene, even when Bashar al-Assad began massacring his own people. The president has given some of our enemies a pass and some of our allies the back of the hand.  He was caught on open mic badmouthing Benjamin Netanyahu and hasn't visited Israel once in his presidency. He left our ally Poland out to dry by canceling the missile defense system in Europe, but was heard on an open mic assuring Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he will have ""more flexibility"" after the election to deal with missile defense. America's two most important investments in the Middle East -- Iraq and Afghanistan -- are hanging by a thread. Ignoring the recommendations of his generals, Obama pulled troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan prematurely. Most recently, an American ambassador and three other Americans were killed in Libya. Yet, for nearly two weeks the administration blamed their deaths on a movie before finally admitting it was a terrorist attack, and took too long to make a forceful defense of the First Amendment. Obamacare: President Obama's crowning legislative achievement, whether he likes to admit it or not, is Obamacare. Mitt Romney has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act and he should make his argument with these reasons: First, Obamacare is not Romneycare. Romneycare was a state mandate; Obamacare was a federal mandate. Second, Obamacare is terrible federal policy. It is a massive tax increase over the next 10 years that will fall largely on middle-class families; it steals more than $700 billion from Medicare to pay for the expanded coverage under ObamaCare; the unelected Independent Payment Advisory Board will ration and control Medicare costs and services without the say of doctors and patients; the Department of Health and Human Services is granted virtually unfettered powers, like the contraception mandate. Obamacare is bad policy. It was over 2,700 pages of complex rules and regulations passed behind closed doors with backroom deals -- exactly the opposite of what Obama promised when he campaigned in 2008. Opinion: Can Romney get back on track? The imperial presidency: Throughout his first term in office, the president has repeatedly ignored or gone around Congress and arrogated his own agenda through executive fiat.  He instituted his own version of the Dream Act; his administration granted waivers to welfare reform without the approval of Congress; he refused to help Arizona enforce its immigration laws; he ordered his Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act in court; he gave states waivers to avoid No Child Left Behind requirements; he claimed executive privilege on Operation Fast and Furious to protect the faults of his Justice Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobbaco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); and when the Senate refused to confirm his nominations to the National Labor Relations Board, he proclaimed the Senate was in recess and appointed them on his own. His own runaway EPA has waged regulatory war on coal plants resulting in the closure of six plants and possible closures of many more.  
Broken promises: If you think I'm being too hard on the president, let's hold him to his own words and promises. He promised to cut the deficit in half in his first term.  He sought in Cairo in 2009 a ""new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world."" He promised to change the ""tone"" of Washington. His economic team promised that his $800 billion stimulus package would keep the unemployment rate under 8 percent. In 2008, he promised to tackle entitlement reform in his first term. Before Obamacare was passed Obama promised to ""cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year"" and that ""If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan."" Americans realize the president has over-promised and under-delivered. The objective record, the multiple failures, and the unkept promises make a profound and fair case against the reelection of Barack Obama. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Trump's astounding interview -- the blamer in chief,"The new moniker for President Donald Trump should be the ""blamer in chief."" When confronted with challenges and problems, there is nothing the President likes to do more than lash out against someone else. In his interview with the New York Times, President Trump seemed like a leader who is fed up with his job. He said he would never have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, one of his longest and most loyal supporters in politics, had he known Sessions would recuse himself concerning the Russia investigation. He attacked the FBI director he fired, James Comey, as someone who had tried to intimidate him to keep his job, while saying that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office is compromised as a result of conflicts of interest. ""There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any,"" the President said about the hometown of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller special counsel to investigate the Russia matter. This is saying a lot from a President who has two children running a massive global business while their father sits in the Oval Office. This interview came shortly after President Trump threatened Republican Senator Dean Heller's career if he did not vote for a bill that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would leave 32 million Americans without health insurance. You could watch Heller's nervous laugh and just imagine what he thought about his lunch partner.  Trump's public rebukes were pretty stunning. The President says the kinds of things about his own Cabinet in public that other presidents would reserve for behind the scenes. This President has absolutely no restraint when it comes to attacking anyone who crosses his path. His own attorney general, the former FBI director and the special counsel now find themselves, at least temporarily, in the space occupied by the entire journalistic community -- other than Fox News -- which he has spent much of his time dismissing as ""fake news"" for its critical coverage.  President Trump can't stop blaming, and maybe this is one of his biggest problems as a leader. The New York Times interview gets right to the heart of his perspective as the leader of the United States. He sees every single problem that he faces, whether that has to do with disclosures about his son's meetings or the collapse of health care reform on Capitol Hill, as someone else's problem. His willingness to turn on an ally like Sessions is evidence that the President has virtually no sense of restraint when it comes to attacking those who do not fulfill his objectives.  As any teacher would say about a student who exhibits these traits, this is the kind of person who is incapable of self-improvement. The comments suggest that the President, who does feel the weight of the Russia scandal much more than he usually admits, is not interested in being introspective and not willing to look at what he, himself, has done or is doing the wrong way.  The venom that he used to talk about Sessions, a conservative Southern Republican who has stood by him from the start of his campaign, is much worse than anything he has been willing to say about Russian President Vladimir Putin and the confirmed Russian intervention in the presidential election. That's probably because, at least in his mind, Putin has not yet let him down. Our great presidents are aware of their own limitations and are capable of learning from their mistakes. This is an essential quality of effective leadership, otherwise the person in power is unable to grow and incapable of bouncing back from moments of political peril.  The problem for President Trump is that it becomes clearer and clearer that many of the problems he faces are of his own making. The health care debacle was not just the result of Senator Heller somehow being disloyal but of the President supporting a deeply flawed and unpopular bill without his having the political acumen to sell the legislation to a skeptical public.  The Russia scandal continues to grow because of the ongoing revelations that members of his family and inner circle met with Russians at Trump Tower and questions about whether there is more to the story.  His refusal to be firm and resolute about what Russia did wrong in meddling in the election aggravates the suspicions of a public that doesn't seem to understand why he feels so determined to be chummy with the Russian leader.  His falling public approval ratings are a product of his behavior and nothing more. The polls register that much of the public doesn't like how he is conducting himself in office. The interview with The New York Times was incredibly revealing -- not because of the specific words that Trump used but because of his entire outlook about why his time in office has been a struggle and seems to be trending the wrong way. Rather than keeping his eye on the television screens, the President might think about looking in the mirror to get a better sense of what's going wrong and consider what steps he would need to take to change the direction of his presidency."
Why 'Obama the populist' is not a winning re-election theme,"President Obama's 2012 campaign is gradually starting to take shape. Rather than focusing on the record from his first term and his competence as the commander in chief, the president is promoting himself as a revived populist, anti-establishment Democrat fighting for the unfulfilled goals of his 2008 campaign.  Referring to the announcement that Bank of America would charge a debit card fee, the president argued that this justified the need for a consumer bureau.  ""You can stop it,"" he said. ""You don't have some inherent right just to, you know, get a certain amount of profit, if your customers are being mistreated.""  During a press conference, Obama expressed some support for the protests taking place on Wall Street. The protest ""expresses frustrations American people feel,"" he said. Through statements such as these, the president hopes to recapture some of the energy that fueled his dramatic run for the White House. In some ways, Obama is looking back to President Harry Truman's 1948 campaign against Republican Thomas Dewey. In a stunning come-from-behind campaign, where most of the pollsters were wrong in their predictions, Truman railed against the ""Do-Nothing Congress"" and appealed to core Democratic constituencies such as organized labor to win re-election. But this style of campaign poses many risks to the president in 2012. Obama does not have the same kind of huge foreign policy record that helped Truman neutralize the GOP in 1948, a campaign that came one year after the Truman Doctrine and the same year as the Marshall Plan.  Yes, Osama bin Laden was killed  and Moammar Gadhafi was ousted during Obama's presidency. But Truman presided over the end of World War II and was the president who oversaw the shaping of America's containment policies to combat international communism. Foreign policy also loomed much larger in the minds of voters as the Cold War was taking shape; today the war on unemployment has overtaken the war on terrorism in the public mind. Rather than repeating the election of 1948, Obama could end up facing some of the problems encountered by President Jimmy Carter in 1980 or, in a different context, Vice President Al Gore in 2000.  A populist, anti-Washington campaign is at odds with the Obama whom the nation has seen up close since January 2009. While the president clearly shares many concerns with the left wing of the party, it's also clear that he is much more comfortable staying close to the center. He governs much more like President Bill Clinton than one might have expected from his 2008 primary campaign. Obama is a pragmatist and a politician, less concerned about ideological purity than about political outcomes.   The president's relationship with the left has been extremely tense. During a series of legislative battles, including the one over health care reform, Obama kept his distance from the base of his party in an effort to find legislation that could win over the handful of centrists in his own party and the GOP. Some members of his administration, including former press secretary Robert Gibbs, have made tough statements about the need for liberals to be more realistic about their goals.  Unlike Truman, who had his own problems with the left, Obama cannot point to a huge record from his party of successful policies that have bolstered the security of America's middle class. When Truman ran in 1948, FDR and the New Deal were still fresh on the minds of most voters. The danger with running too strongly as a populist is that it can quickly appear disingenuous. If Obama pushes too hard on the populist theme, he could sound a bit like Gore in 2000, who fell flat -- after years of standing as a voice of centrism -- when he railed against the wealthy.  In certain respects, Obama's efforts to win over the left could backfire, causing activists to feel that they are being used rather than being given an honest choice about whom they would rather have in office -- a Democrat who compromises or a Republican who will be under immense pressure from the tea party. To be sure, the liberal base won't vote for Mitt Romney or Rick Perry. But many could decide not to vote at all. Another problem with Obama's emerging strategy is that the anti-Congress campaign would be hard to pull off.  When Truman turned to this theme in 1948, Congress was under Republican control. The nation had divided government, not a divided Congress, which is currently the case with a Democratic-controlled Senate and a Republican House.  When Obama lashes out against Congress he is taking shots at his fellow Democrat, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, not just at House Speaker John Boehner. Voters will have trouble seeing how one party is to blame for the performance of Congress when neither party controls everything. Moreover, it is harder to run an anti-establishment campaign when you are the face of Washington. Carter learned this in 1980. The heart of Carter's campaign in 1976 had been to clean up government and regain the trust of voters who were disillusioned with Washington as a result of Watergate. When Carter ran in 1980, he couldn't pull off the anti-Washington stance. Like  Obama, Carter was no longer a fresh voice and he was deeply tied to events in Washington.  If Obama is too tough on the political establishment, it is possible that some moderate and independent voters might very well agree with his analysis of the problem, but then decide to vote for the Republican nominee who does not carry the same kind of baggage from the capital.  The final challenge for Obama is that the focus on anti-government populism will prevent him, or dissuade him, from talking about his legislative accomplishments. In the end, most of the presidents who have successfully run for re-election have defended and championed what they accomplished in Washington. They explained to the voters how they improved the nation.  Until now, Republicans have been able to control the narrative of Obama's presidency. They have depicted everything he has done -- from the stimulus to financial regulation -- as ineffective, and they are now developing an argument that he is not only failing to fix the economy but responsible for the worsening of the situation.  At some level, Obama needs to explain to voters what he has done and how he has strengthened the nation -- even in difficult economic times. If he simply ignores his own record and allows Republicans to define what happened in his first four years, he risks leaving himself open to a tough attack from his opponents.  President Obama must be true to the kind of Democrat he has been -- not trying to reinvent himself in a media culture that constantly reminds voters of who he really is -- and he must define and champion the record that he has accomplished.  If the president wants to persuade voters to support him, he has to convince them that his style of politics and his legislative record are the basis for four better years ahead."
Michigan to Romney: Go away,"One very clear reason why Mitt Romney is far from a lock to win the Michigan primary, despite his ties to the state,  is that he's not really tied to the state. He was born here, he lived here. But he's not family. Not anymore.   That's why the characterization of Rick Santorum polling well in Romney's backyard is a bit misguided. The truth is, many of us disowned that two-faced liar years ago. We remember how, back in 2008, Romney came home promising to do all he could to save the auto industry. And we believed him and voted for him and he won the primary here. Then, after he dropped out of the race, he wrote a New York Times op-ed that carried the headline ""Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."" The opening sentence: ""If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye."" What the hell? I thought he said he was one of us.  Later in the piece, Romney talks about why we should let the auto industry go bankrupt. Although he lays out some very sound reasons for this -- including an anecdotal story of when his father, George, took over American Motors -- at the end of the day he fails to mention the most important thing. Us.   He forgot about the people back home who depended on the auto industry to put food on the table, pay mortgages, send the kids to college. He greeted us like family when he needed our votes, but when he left town he treated us like strangers. If Romney didn't think a bailout was the best way to help the state, he should have said that when he came here looking for delegates and let the people at his rallies decide if they agreed with him. Instead he pandered, then kicked dirt in our faces on his way out the door -- an all too familiar pattern with Romney.  The reason Santorum is gaining votes in Michigan isn't because he's so liked here,  though his social conservative rhetoric plays well in the western side of the state. But it's because we've been burned by Romney before. He tells the people in front of him what they want to hear. But when he sets his sights on a new shiny object, he changes the script to fit his new needs.  We've seen him do it with abortion and health care reform. We've seen him do it with taxes.   When Romney was running for the Senate in 1994, he sent the Log Cabin Republicans of Massachusetts, a gay rights organization, a letter saying ""don't ask, don't tell"" was the first of ""a number of steps that will ultimately lead to gays and lesbians being able to serve openly and honestly in our nation's military.""  Then in 2007, when he was running for president, he said he would not change the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, and that changing it would amount to a ""social experiment."" I might not like a lot of Santorum's views, but at least I know what they are. Saying Romney flip-flops is an insult to flip-flops. That's why, according to a poll by the American Research Group, 33% of Michigan GOP voters say they support Santorum and only 27% support Romney. In response to his unstable footing in his ""home"" state, Romney penned a new op-ed in Tuesday's Detroit News to defend his New York Times piece. In true partisan fashion, he blasts President Obama for orchestrating the auto bailout while neglecting to mention in 2008 President Bush had moved to give Chrysler and GM billions of taxpayer's dollars at the beginning of 2009. This is one of the reasons why Obama has to remind the public about the Bush years. If he doesn't, Republicans like Romney and Santorum will try to whitewash history and limit the economic conversation to the past three years as if we're in a vacuum.  Oh, and by the way, he was wrong.  The auto industry did not collapse.  In fact, reports show the bailouts saved an estimated 1.5 million jobs. The auto industry is expected to grow by 28% by 2015, with the Big Three set to hire about 33,000 people in Michigan alone. And while Ford did not participate in the bailout, G.M. did, and was able to regain its place as the top automaker in the world. Chrysler also took part and recorded its first annual net profit since 1997, and announced plans to invest $500 million in an assembly plant in nearby Toledo, Ohio, adding an entire second shift of jobs over the course of the year.  Couple all that with 23 consecutive months of job growth across the nation and what you have is good news for Michigan and choppy political waters for Romney. He's scheduled to appear in Grand Rapids on Wednesday, presumably with a big ol' plate of crow.  He knows as the auto industry goes, so goes the state. He also knows we remember he said the country should let the auto industry hit rock bottom. Had Romney said that to our faces when he was campaigning here four years ago, we could at least respect what he has to say about the auto industry and the state of the economy today.  But it's going to be tough to sit and listen to Romney, knowing he will try to say whatever he thinks we want to hear. And  besides, our backs are still sore from that knife he stuck in them in 2008.  Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook."
Is Romney running against Bush's third term?,"It was a Republican, Richard Nixon, who laid out the blueprint for getting elected president: In the primary, you court the extremes to please the party's base; in the general election, you race to the center to get as many votes as possible. But nowadays, candidates in both parties tend to follow it. Many voters have probably become used to the idea that candidates go through this moderate makeover.  This year, however, there is a twist. Only one of the major candidates is in the center, and it's not the Republican. The candidate on the right is staying put, well, on the right. When Mitt Romney spoke Wednesday to the annual conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee did not sugarcoat his opposition to President Obama's policies, especially the president's health-care overhaul, which Romney promised to eliminate along with ""every non-essential, expensive program"" he could find. That pledge was met with a loud chorus of boos that lasted more than 10 seconds.    Still, Romney didn't back down. He deserves credit for addressing a group that is so heavily invested in Obama, and even more credit for not turning himself inside out to be liked. He also maintained his composure a few weeks ago when he addressed the annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Romney didn't apologize for taking a hard-line against illegal immigration during the Republican primary to the point of portraying illegal immigrants as takers who hurt the economy and drain social services. Nor did he say he was wrong for opposing the DREAM Act, which would have given legal status to undocumented immigrants who go to college or join the military.   In my opinion, Romney should have said those things. He has a lot for which to apologize. But he didn't.  After the NAACP speech, one Romney adviser privately told a reporter for the New York Times that Romney has presented basically the same agenda to every audience throughout the campaign, and he commended the candidate for not backing away from positions that the audience was likely to find unpopular, like repealing Obamacare. Political observers can argue over why they think this is happening. Maybe Romney only knows how to give one generic speech. Maybe he's not comfortable pandering to special interest groups, especially those with an ethnic or racial agenda.  From other things I've read, I think that Romney and his campaign advisers are terrified of him being labeled a ""flip-flopper"" and that this dissuades them from making any sharp turns or dramatic course corrections. More than anything, they want to do something that Romney has had trouble doing in the past: appear steady and consistent.  Meanwhile, President Obama has had liberal supporters scratch their heads as he claimed for his own a series of conservative positions that they oppose.  This is not simply an election year gimmick. It has been going on for sometime. In fact, if you ignore what Obama says and focus only on what he does, you'll see that Obama has actually spent most of his presidency in the center, even, on some issues, following the example of his predecessor.  While neither liberals nor conservatives are eager to admit it, they can no longer deny it: Americans are living through George W. Bush's third term. Obama loves to criticize the 43rd president, almost as much as he loves to emulate him. In the war on terror, aspects of foreign policy, education reform, immigration, corporate bailouts and a host of other issues with the exception of health care reform, Obama has taken up the sorts of positions that conservatives usually champion.  And the left has noticed, which is why the president now and then gets blowback from parts of the same liberal coalition that helped elect him. They must wonder what happened to the person they helped put in office, and many of these disillusioned liberals now talk about voting for Obama as the ""lesser of two evils."" The president's decision this week to extend the Bush tax cuts for incomes under $250,000 is just the latest example of the president taking his cues from the former president that liberals love to hate.  (True, Obama is campaigning against the part of the Bush tax cuts that applied to income above $250,000.)  We'll soon know which of these strategies proves more successful in garnering votes: moving to the center, or staying the course. There are advantages and liabilities to each. Of course, what would really be nice and refreshing, is, if just once, someone running for president on a major party ticket took positions not to manipulate the outcome of an election but because he believed they were the correct positions to take.  Maybe Obama and Romney are doing that. Maybe what we're hearing is what they really believe. It's hard to tell. And even harder to believe.

There are tradeoffs to Obamacare,"It seems difficult to open a paper, turn on TV or visit a website these days without hearing some awful new ""discovery"" about Obamacare and how it's going to end the world. More often than not, these claims are overblown, designed to get attention and score political points.  This week, the New York Times published an article explaining that the savings many people hope to see in lower-cost insurance could come at the cost of fewer choices with respect to health care providers. This is very true.  If we want to be realistic about health  care reform, we have to acknowledge that everything comes with a tradeoff.  In order to make insurance cost less, private insurance companies have to make use of the tools available to them.  In the past, they could have tried preferentially to cover healthier people and refuse coverage to those with chronic conditions. That leaves a cheaper risk pool, which results in lower premiums.  But Obamacare no longer allows that. If we want guaranteed issue and community ratings (so that no one can be denied insurance and no one can be charged more for being sick), then insurance companies must use other strategies to save money.  In the past, insurance companies could have tried to issue policies that didn't cover as much. Policies with skimpier benefits are cheaper, too. But Obamacare sets minimums with respect to what qualifies as comprehensive coverage. So that tool was taken away as well. In the past, insurance companies could have set lower annual or lifetime limits, which confines their risk and allows them to sell insurance at a lower price. Or, they could have set really high deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums. These, too, are now more tightly regulated.  So what's left? How can insurance companies make health care cheaper so that they can deliver lower premiums to people and attract more business? Well, one thing they could do is limit their administrative costs. But if you ask insurance companies, they tell you that they are already running pretty lean. They also like to make a nice profit, and they like to pay their executives well. So they are left with one really good option: Pay less for care. How do they do this?  One way they've been doing it for years is to contract with certain doctors and hospitals to provide care for their beneficiaries for less money. Providers will agree to this because it guarantees them a certain amount of business. Insurance companies like it because it means they can pay less, charge lower premiums and sell more policies. And that is how many plans in the health care exchanges will compete for your business. Please understand that this is nothing new with respect to health insurance. At my job, there are a number of different plans offered to employees. The most expensive plan allows us to see the widest range of physicians. There's a cheaper plan available, but my kids' pediatrician (whom we revere) isn't in that network. So we pay for the more expensive plan. That's a choice we make as informed consumers. Problems will arise if people don't understand what they are getting into. There's no such thing as a free lunch.  If you buy the cheapest plan, it may not include the doctor you want. If choice is your No. 1 goal, then you will probably have to pay for it. What makes this a problem for Obamacare, though, is that some health exchanges aren't offering a choice. For instance, in New Hampshire, only one insurance company is offering exchange plans, and it has a rather limited network. If you were previously uninsured, then the most straightforward argument is that the plan you're getting, probably with subsidies to make it cheaper, is better than nothing. But some people, who might have had individually issued policies before Obamacare with larger networks, will not be happy with their new plans. They may be cheaper, but they may have preferred to pay more for choice, and now they won't be able to. No policy is perfect. On the whole, I believe far more people will benefit from Obamacare than will be hurt by it. Any change will inevitably make someone unhappy. This is one of those situations. We shouldn't ignore this deficiency. We should fix it. One way might be to have a public option, run by the government, which might have a larger network. Medicare has perhaps the largest national network in the country, as more doctors accept it than just about any other form of insurance.  So it's totally possible to offer more choice. But that will require politicians to work together to amend the law to make it better. It will be instructive to watch how people react to news like this. If they are truly concerned about fixing this problem, then they will seek solutions to do so. If they use this issue only to demagogue against the entire law, though, it's likely that they care more about politics than policy. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

"Obamacare delay: Business wins, the rest of us lose","As a rehabilitation physician, I've supported many of the ideas behind the Affordable Care Act since before Barack Obama's presidency began. During the hot summer of town hall debates surrounding the legislation in 2009, I wrote an essay called ""Standing up for Obama's health plan,"" and I have continued highlighting the fundamental advances that all of us, most especially disabled Americans, stand to share under the ACA.  But when the Obama administration decided last week to pull out a major pillar of the ACA, they lost my faith in their political wisdom.  There was a practical necessity to many of the president's other compromises in order to get the ACA passed. Regrettably, it gives states just enough power over insurance marketplaces and the Medicaid expansion to continue the unequal and unfair distribution of state-based social services. It allows states to eviscerate Medicaid in ways that don't make sense.  In some states, Medicaid pays to save the life of a stroke victim in the hospital, but then denies adequate rehabilitation services and devices to prevent that person's ongoing health problems from rapidly placing further strain on the thin social-service safety net.  The vast majority of Americans get medical insurance through their employers, although  the number of employers that offer insurance has fallen 10% since 2000, and the insurance they do offer is increasingly lousy. Low-quality insurance, like so-called ""mini medical"" plans, is common. Employees won't know their coverage is insufficient until it's too late. If you work for one of these companies and your child suffers a serious trauma, the 30 visits or fewer these plans offer for outpatient therapy simply won't be enough. I've seen this gut-wrenching situation time and again. True health care reform must end this sorry state of affairs in the workplace, where health care is centered. But by postponing for a year the implementation of the ACA's requirement that employers with more than 50 full-time workers offer insurance of minimally acceptable quality or face fines of $2,000 to $3,000, the administration has weakened the core of health care reform. It is delaying a critical national debate on what the ACA minimums should be.   How did this happen? The administration caved to pressure from business lobbyists, who, according to Politico, ""mounted a coordinated campaign to convince senior White House officials that their date for requiring coverage was simply impractical.""  It's too bad patients and health care providers didn't get their counterbalancing message out. Without it, the business lobby was able to create an atmosphere of false urgency by claiming businesses weren't ready to start filing the information about the insurance plans they offer (or don't).  Without that critical information, the rest of the already heavily compromised ACA apparatus starts to tilt precariously. How can the government enforce the individual mandate, which requires people to buy insurance if their employers don't offer it or if they offer insurance that is substandard or overpriced? Without information from businesses, the government won't know whether individuals are claiming legitimate exemptions or not. The federal government has long excelled at helping private businesses attract and retain workers with affordable benefits. American business lobbyists don't gripe so much about the nearly $200 billion in tax credits the nation grants their clients by designating employer-offered health benefits nontaxable.  You'd think businesses would be pleased that the Congressional Budget Office projects that businesses that don't offer qualifying insurance plans will be paying only $10 billion in penalties in 2014.  Now they'll be paying zilch. In its notice announcing the ACA delay, the administration correctly states that the vast majority of employers already provide insurance. But so what? The ACA is as much about regulating insurance as encouraging businesses to provide it.  America's employers, left to their own devices, have been exchanging dinky medical insurance for cheaper products and services for too long. Peachtree Hotel Group, which owns a variety of chain hotels, mostly in the South, recently disclosed to The Wall Street Journal how much it nickle-and-dimes  the health of its 550 employees. The company's chief financial officer says it offers a limited benefit plan, and now that the ACA is delayed for a year, it may increase the employee contribution on the full-benefit plan it was planning to offer next year under the law.  The next time you stay at Peachtree's Courtyard by Marriott in Gulf Shores, Alabama, know that you could be paying a few cents less for your room so that Peachtree can provide capped health coverage to its valued employees. But if a Peachtree employee were to suffer a catastrophic injury, every taxpaying citizen of Alabama would be paying a few cents more to provide the Medicaid coverage and social services the patient needs.  Why does it make sense to let companies make irresponsible choices in exchange for a little more profit? These are the kinds of cutthroat business decisions a massive piece of legislation like the ACA should combat.  The retail and restaurant lobbyists who stealthily hunted bigger profit margins these past few months will now seize on the act's wounded carcass. Republicans are already charging that this delay proves the administration knows the ACA is unworkable. They're using this decision as another opportunity to stop or delay the law.  They're right to do so. The ACA represents a large, painful change for a number of American institutions. Hospitals, doctors, patients, insurers and our government are in for a period of turmoil as these changes pulse through society's many layers. Handing a reprieve to one of those groups is unfair to the rest of us, and will distort the necessary debates as specific problems come to light just in time for the 2014 midterm elections.  The administration should either delay the whole law until 2015 or go forward in 2014 as planned. Mortally wounding the ACA before the coming battle isn't compromise -- it's foreshadowing.

Epic failure by Washington sets us adrift,"There are plenty of ways to game the upcoming Supreme Court decision on health care reform, and they've all been said: President Obama loses in court, he wins with his base. Or it's a severe blow, potentially fatal. Or Republicans benefit if they win, because they were ""right"" all along. Or the GOP loses, because it has to figure out what to offer for health care instead. And so it goes.  But there's something else going on here, and it's more meaningful than some short-term political skirmishing. This Supreme Court case is the Waterloo for political polarization, because it underscores something we should have known all along:  Great changes in national public policy should never be erected on slender partisan majorities. If they are, they will always be suspect.  It's a proposition advanced by the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who understood there's little upside to partisan policymaking. After all, he was a member of the 1983 commission that reformed -- and saved -- Social Security for a generation. The program faced collapse; a bipartisan group of heavy-hitters fixed it, together. No one liked all that the rescue plan contained. But the work had to be done and they did it.  That kind of work is not something we see a lot of these days: health care reform, arguably the most far-reaching social legislation since Medicare, was passed strictly along party lines. Sure, the White House says -- with some justification -- that Republicans weren't interested in their plan. But would the GOP have bitten on a more scaled-back version? Would some in the GOP have broken ranks over, say, requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions so long as it wouldn't bankrupt them? Sure.            But that wasn't to be. The Democrats had a two-house majority, so the stars were aligned. And with recalcitrant Republicans vocal in their opposition, the Democrats, too, became more strident.            So reform was an all-Democratic bill, a sure way to be challenged before the high court. And no one looks good: the president, who Monday seemed to be warning the court about ""judicial activism"" in advance of any decision; the court, which about half of the public now believes is political anyway; and Congress, which has an approval rating so low it's hard to even find.            That's what happens when Washington's default setting is always along party lines.             And it's not going to get any better. As congressional districts are redrawn to benefit partisans, those  elected become -- naturally -- more partisan. So there is no political benefit to compromise, and as conservative southern Democrats virtually disappear, there are no natural allies left in the Democratic party for vote-hunting GOPers. The same goes for Democrats in search of moderate Republicans, most of whom are either quitting Congress out of frustration (see: Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine) or are fighting for their political lives (see: Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana).            Imagine today's Congress passing, by bipartisan majorities, legislation on two controversial issues: taxes and immigration reform. Impossible, right? Well, it was done in the mid-1980's. The tax measure lowered rates and eliminated some loopholes (many, alas, have crept back into the code, but that's another story.) And the immigration bill legalized certain illegal immigrants while punishing employers for hiring illegal immigrants. (And of course we are back at that issue again). So while the measures were far from permanent or perfect solutions, they were big fixes. Sure, Democrats controlled the House and Republicans maintained control of the Senate and President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, was in his second term, finding a way to cut deals with members of both parties.  Oh, and by the way, the chairmen of the tax-writing committee -- a House Democrat and a Senate Republican -- actually worked together to get something through the Congress. Ditto for those writing the immigration legislation. I know. I watched them in action. Believe me, it was nothing like watching the debt-ceiling debacle of last summer. Even when there was one small glimmer of hope that the White House and GOP House Speaker John Boehner might work something out, it disappeared. And almost one year later, each side is trying to get history to blame the other fellow for the failure to strike a deal. It's too bad, really. Because in the end, history will blame both sides -- for looking small when most of the country thinks our problems deserve solutions that are really big.   Follow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion.

Disrespect of Obama hits new low,"Just when you didn't think Republicans could top themselves in finding ways to disrespect the President of the United States, on Monday, 47 Republican Senators -- that is, all but seven -- sent a letter to Iran that appeared aimed at scuttling President Obama's diplomatic efforts to prevent Tehran developing nuclear weapons capacity. The move comes on the heels of House Republicans inviting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress -- without even informing the White House of the plan to issue an invitation. But this latest measure went a step further, seeing Republicans in Congress literally stepping on the constitutional toes of the executive branch and formally intruding on U.S. diplomacy. Under the Logan Act passed by Congress way back in 1799, U.S. citizens are prevented from influencing ""disputes or controversies"" involving the United States and a foreign government, without express authority to do so. Now, it appears the Iran letter was carefully drafted by Sen. Tom Cotton, a smart constitutional lawyer, to come as close as possible to the line of legality without crossing it, specifically by not explicitly taking a position against the Iran negotiations. Yet the intent to interfere with the executive branch is clear.  It's one thing for Congress to demand it ratify such a deal (as Democrats did in 2002 when President Bush negotiated arms reductions with Russian President Vladimir Putin). But it's something else entirely to undermine the authority of the White House by sending a partisan letter to a foreign government (something Democrats didn't do with Russia). Sadly, this is only the most recent and extreme example of dishonor and disrespect. In the Washington Post, columnist Jonathan Capehart recently outlines what he sees as the top six instances of disrespect toward President Obama. His list includes the example of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani saying, ""I do not believe that the President loves America.""  Also on Capehart's list are the time a reporter from the conservative Daily Caller website interrupted the President during remarks at the White House about immigration reform in 2012, and the time South Carolina congressman Joe Wilson, a Republican, heckled the President during his speech to a joint session of Congress about health care reform. (Wilson shouted ""You lie!"" in response to remarks by the President that, it should be noted, were in fact quite true). And there are plenty more examples of Republican slights against President Obama. Most famously, there was the widespread questioning of Obama's citizenship and academic credentials that included signs at conservative rallies describing Obama as a ""lyin' African."" And there was the Republican women's group that created an image of ""food stamp dollars"" with Obama's face on them (as well as a bucket of KFC and watermelon). There was also Republican presidential candidate and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich decrying Obama's ""Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior.""  Plus there was then-Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer waving her finger at President Obama when she greeted Air Force One on the tarmac. Brewer later alleged she ""felt a little bit threatened"" by the President. Taken as a whole, this list suggests a troubling pattern of profound disrespect for the President. But more than this, it seems to reflect an anti-Obama fever that has gripped the Republican Party -- one that the letter to Iran suggests shows no signs of breaking, and is a sure sign of sickness in the Republican Party. Is the lack of respect being shown toward President Obama about race, as some have suggested? Yes and no. Certainly, for a segment of the country, it really is about being uncomfortable with a black president. Indeed, even former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican, noted what he described as a ""dark vein"" of intolerance in the party and parts of the country in general. But beyond that hopefully shrinking share of the population that is explicitly racist, there is a far wider issue of implicit racial bias -- an unconscious, yet nonetheless real tendency, to subject President Obama to extra scrutiny because of the color of his skin. None of this is to suggest that all of the criticism aimed at President Obama stems from implicit racial bias. But such bias appears to be a factor in the ease and extremity of disrespect aimed at America's first black president.  And this disrespect mirrors the disrespect shown against black Americans in general.   ""Honorable people can disagree over policy,"" Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement Tuesday.  Yes, and they should do so honorably. Whatever Republicans' gripes about President Obama's vision and leadership, the party and its followers are too often expressing their critiques in an ugly way. And that rampant pattern of disrespect -- for any fellow human being, let alone the president of the United States of America -- is what truly undermines the principles and values of our nation.

What foes get wrong about plan to lower health costs,"Presidential campaigns can be hesitant to put out policy proposals because these ideas are easily caricatured and attacked by political opponents. So, it takes some real courage to put plans in front of the electorate.  That's why Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker deserve credit for their willingness to put forth thoughtful proposals to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and replace it with sensible, patient-centered reforms. There are certainly policy differences between the three candidates' proposals, and voters would be well-served by a robust discussion about the distinctions between them. Specifically, Rubio's proposal to gradually phase out the existing tax preference for employer-sponsored health insurance and replace it with a tax credit to individuals for the purchase of health insurance is perhaps the boldest and most impactful of all the health care reform ideas that have been proposed thus far.  Indeed, there is no single policy change that would be more responsible for reducing health care costs in the United States.   But Obamacare's supporters are making inaccurate claims that Rubio's proposal will either raise taxes or increase health insurance premiums on many Americans. Both of these claims need to be debunked. A bit of history is in order.  Since an Internal Revenue Service ruling in the 1940s, the tax code has provided an uncapped incentive for employers to furnish health benefits to their employees. That's because the value of health benefits furnished by employers is excluded from the taxable income of employees.   Health care benefits for employees, then, are effectively purchased with ""pre-tax"" dollars. In contrast, individuals who want to purchase health insurance on their own are generally required to purchase these benefits with ""after-tax"" dollars, raising their effective cost. That's why about 150 million Americans get their health benefits through the workplace.  And it's also one of the reasons why health spending has been driven upward over time. The passage of Obamacare will bring significant changes to the status quo. Why? The law effectively ends the open-ended tax incentive for employer-sponsored health insurance by imposing a provision known as the ""Cadillac Tax."" Beginning in 2018, employers that offer health insurance plans that exceed a certain value ($10,200 for individual coverage in 2018, increasing yearly) will be required to pay a tax of 40% on any benefits provided in excess of that threshold.   That means employers will no longer have an unlimited tax incentive to provide health benefits to their employees -- and the plans they offer are sure to change as a result. Now, back to Rubio's proposal.  By gently phasing out the current tax treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance and replacing it with a tax credit that is available to every American, Rubio is trying to equalize the treatment of health benefits purchased by individuals and through employers while controlling costs and to do so without the imposition of a new tax.   The end result of Rubio's proposal is very similar to the end game that the Cadillac Tax in Obamacare envisions. So, it is disingenuous for the law's supporters to attack this component of Rubio's proposal.  Furthermore, to claim that Rubio's plan will result in a tax increase is simply wrong.  Detractors of his proposal conveniently forget that he is offering every American a tax credit to offset the cost of health insurance.  Taken as a whole, therefore, Rubio's health care proposal may actually result in a significant tax cut on the American people.  For those who purchase health insurance on their own currently, without any tax benefits, Rubio's credit will likely result in a tax cut -- the magnitude of which will depend on the size of the tax credit.  For those who get their insurance through their employers, two interacting trends are likely to result. First, employers will begin to change the mix of plans they offer to accommodate the shift in policy and, second, employees will pick plans that will allow them to avoid paying more in taxes.  The claim that the plan will result in higher premiums is similarly misguided. In fact, Rubio's proposal is the one policy change that will likely drive health costs down in the long-run.  That's because it will generally shift the U.S. health system away from costly and inefficient first-dollar coverage toward consumer-directed plans that carry lower premiums, higher deductibles and more closely function as true insurance rather than prepaid health care.   People will think carefully about incurring health care expenditures before doing so, a key development if we are to lower health costs in America.  And many Americans will actually see their health premiums decrease (just how much, of course, is a function of the level at which Rubio's tax credit is ultimately set). Rubio's other proposed reforms would also return a greater measure of choice to the health insurance marketplace, so that consumers can select between the plans that suit them best (rather than the relatively limited choices that Obamacare's federal regulatory regime has created). And while it's true that Rubio's plan will result in more Americans securing health coverage on their own rather than through an employer, businesses will still have an incentive to offer coverage because they get to deduct these benefits as business expenses -- and nothing in Rubio's plan contemplates a change to this part of the tax code.  In the coming months, we are sure to hear Obamacare's supporters continue to engage in fearmongering and disingenuous attacks against any presidential candidate who presents ideas to replace the law. That's why Republicans seeking Obamacare's repeal need to be clear about their ideas, able to describe why their proposals are better, and prepared to show how they will actually implement these policies if elected. It's a huge challenge, but one that needs to be met if Republicans hope to win back the White House next year.  Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

Why Washington should continue billions in health care subsidies,"It's not every day that hospitals and insurers see eye to eye, but there is one thing we agree on -- the government must continue to help lower the cost of health care that millions of lower-income Americans receive. The Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) payments, which have been paid on a monthly basis to insurers for the past three years, are an integral part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Whether to continue with the payments is a central issue in the ongoing health care reform debate in Washington. The CSR program is critical to our ability to provide comprehensive and affordable care to patients across the country but it is caught in an unresolved legal quagmire. These payments have made it possible for patients who earn up to 250% of the federal poverty level, or roughly $60,000 dollars for a family of four, to see a doctor, receive treatment, get their needed medicine and, in some cases, get the surgery needed to restore their health -- at a price they can afford. This helps reduce the number of hospitalizations, readmissions and unnecessary visits to the emergency room. Nearly 7 million people, or almost 60% of those in the ACA marketplace, receive help that reduces their deductibles, copayments and out-of-pocket costs as a result of the CSR program. This amounts to at least $7 billion per year in help. However, a lawsuit by Republicans in the House of Representatives that began during the Obama administration challenged the constitutionality of the method by which the payments were made. This case is unresolved, and the legal limbo and political fighting are threatening to end the payments. The House-passed version of the ""repeal and replace"" bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA), did not address this issue, leaving it up to the executive branch to decide whether to make these payments since the legal case still sits in the courts.  However, as the Senate considers its bill, there is discussion about the possibility of making the payments, which is something the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady of Texas, called for last week. While the Senate bill currently has the payments included in its draft, it is not clear this provision will remain in the bill as opposition to the overall bill builds. Assuming the payments are made, a question remains: For how long? If the Trump administration decides to stop making the payments, health insurance companies will be stuck with the bill; they still have the responsibility of reducing the payments on behalf of their customers but absorb the cost. If this happens, most experts believe, the insurers will either drop out of the program or raise premiums sharply to account for this new cost.  Regardless, the outcome would likely be millions either losing or dropping coverage with the consequence that they would no longer seek medical care until it was an emergency -- a return to the old days. If this market disruption happens, I believe individual and community health will decline because patients will be shut out of the health care system because it's no longer affordable.  Hospitals will certainly be negatively impacted if the subsidies are eliminated. If millions of Americans lose or drop their coverage, we will see a jump in bad debt and uncompensated care -- that is care for which we receive no payments. In this scenario, everyone else will face higher premiums, higher deductibles and higher out-of-pocket costs to help cover those who no longer have coverage.  Eliminating CSR payments would have an immediate, negative impact on patients -- their health and their finances will take a huge hit. These payments give patients who need the most help the stability they need to ensure they receive the high-quality care they deserve.  Our elected officials, in the name of individual and community health, must continue to fund CSR payments until a better solution is developed for the people who need care the most."
GOP's risky delusion about town hall protests,"White House spokesman Sean Spicer is kidding himself if he truly thinks the wave of protesters swarming Republican congressional town hall meetings from coast to coast represent a flash in the pan, or some less-than-authentic paid lobbyist campaign. ""Protesting has become a profession now,"" Spicer said on Fox News. ""They have every right to do that. Don't get me wrong, but I think that we need to call it what it is. It's not these organic uprisings that we've seen through the last several decades. You know, the tea party was a very organic movement. This has become a very paid, Astroturf-type movement."" Wrong, Mr. Spicer. The town hall protests appear to be driven by an authentic concern about the future of health care reform and troubling reports about Russian meddling in the November elections.  Reporters who investigated allegations that paid protesters disrupted a recent town hall in Utah found none, and even some Republican lawmakers  targeted by protesters in Iowa and upstate New York acknowledge the anxiety of their constituents is real. In the words of Rich Lowry, editor of the conservative National Review: ""In the normal course of things, it's not easy even for a well-funded and -organized group to get people to spend an evening at a school auditorium hooting at their congressman. If these demonstrations are happening in districts around the country, attention must be paid."" That's putting it mildly. Confronted by journalists, Spicer later hedged a bit: ""I think some people are clearly upset. But there is a bit of professional protester, manufactured base in there,"" he said at a recent briefing -- no doubt reflecting what his boss, President Trump tweeted: ""The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists."" There's no question that activists have been busy: A group of Democratic staff member and volunteers operating under the title Indivisible started an online campaign to encourage citizens to attend town hall meetings.  The short how-to guide explaining town hall activism, which quickly went viral, was clearly modeled on a similar document that conservative tea party activists used in the run-up to the 2010 elections. And now, as in 2010, the prairie fire of grass-roots activism has attracted mainstream money, manpower and strategy: specifically, Democratic strategists who hope to ride the current wave of discontent into a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. It's not a crazy idea.  Republicans control the House by 24 votes, and there are 23 Republican House members whose districts voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in November, providing a tempting target for Dems.   ""History is on the Democrats' side,"" says Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball. ""The President's party has lost ground in the House in 36 of 39 midterms since the Civil War. The average loss is 33 seats, a shift in seats that would flip the House next year.""  That's easier said than done: The Democratic Party is still smarting from last year's shellacking, and is engaged in a low-key but intense battle for the future of the party that will play out as leaders select a new chairman of the Democratic National Committee this week.  Trump and Republican leaders run a political risk in pretending millions of people aren't worried about losing their health care, and are ready to punish lawmakers who seem hostile or indifferent to their concerns.  That leaves little room for Trump's dismissive attitude. ""Democrats deluded themselves in 2009 by disregarding the early signs of fierce resistance to their agenda, and paid the price over and over again for their heedless high-handedness,"" Lowry writes. ""Republicans shouldn't make the same mistake."" All the more reason for GOP leaders to stop pretending that tampering with the health care of 17 million Americans was ever going to be a quick or quiet process."
Is Trump the 'Ahnold' of 2016?,"Donald Trump is macho. Apologizing to no one, bulldozing competition, scoffing at political correctness and firing anyone in his path have been his stock in trade for years.  He's renowned for making money, for his brand of arrogant confidence and braggadocio, and most recently, for his presidential ambitions.   This week, for example, as he deflected foreign policy questions from radio host Hugh Hewitt, he boasted that ""I will be so good at the military your head will spin."" Last week, with just a glance at his security detail, he had Hispanic journalist Jorge Ramos ejected from a room for talking out of turn. This kind of thing is routine with candidate Trump.  When he first announced, I immediately thought of Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign for governor of California.  He was a political novice, and a caricature of a particular style of masculinity, the action movie hero.  California elected him anyway.   Now comes Trump, similarly succeeding not in spite of his political incorrectness and macho masculine politics, but because of them.  As a sociologist who takes transformations in masculinities seriously, I'm fascinated.  There's a history of masculine posturing in presidential campaigns.  In 1840 William Henry Harrison unseated Martin Van Buren by running a mudslinging campaign in which he framed himself as a man of the people, and ""Marty"" as effeminate, obsequious, and with an air of European aristocracy.  Harrison and the popular press continuously challenged Van Buren's masculinity.  After winning election, Harrison took his oath on an intensely cold day in Washington and refused to wear a coat for fear of appearing unmanly. Some differ on whether his macho display is what caused him to fall ill with pneumonia, but one month into his term he was dead.  Even so, since Harrison's election, this kind of masculine posturing has become more expected in political campaigns.   Challenging someone's claim on manliness is serious politics. It's why Vladimir Putin is often depicted doing all manner of macho outdoor activities that have nothing (and clearly everything) to do with holding political power in Russia.  And it's part of the reason Trump publicly challenged Sen. John McCain's status as a war hero, and did not back down. Similarly, John Kerry tried to capitalize politically on his war record.  Taking a page from Harrison's tactics, the Bush campaign was able to cast Kerry as bourgeois and effete — and defeated him handily.   Campaigns in presidential elections are performances on the international stage and gender is part of the script. Candidates on the road roll up their sleeves, posing as men of the people.   Financial success and success in battle and the boardroom help frame candidates as ""man enough"" for the job. Adoring wives and children reinforce the message.  Political campaigns are about much more than gender performances, but performances of masculinity matter.  Trump showed awareness of this when he said he would ""tone it down"" if elected to office.  But his macho attitude is also related to why he ran in the first place. The paradox in Americans' fondness for Trump is that we recognize him as a masculine caricature while simultaneously taking him and his campaign seriously. But research on gender and leadership supports this contradiction. While boys and girls have similar rates of political ambition when they are young, research shows that aspirations for political office among adolescent girls start to decline precipitously just as boys' political ambition rises.  This is in contrast to Americans' beliefs about gender differences in qualities associated with political leadership.  The Pew Research Center reports that most Americans perceive women to be more likely than men to exhibit key qualities of political leadership: ability to compromise, being honest and ethical, working to improve the quality of life in the United States and standing up for one's beliefs.   Only around 10% of Americans think men are more likely to have these qualities, while two to three times that proportion believe women are more likely.  So, why are women in short supply in government while men like Donald Trump seem to be on the ballot in every election? We can't ignore the role of casual arrogance that men — white men in particular — get away with.  If I'm white and a man, when I'm asked if I'm ""qualified to run for office,"" and I look at other people already in office, I see myself.  They look like me.  I fit — I'm who one thinks of when they imagine what a ""politician"" looks like.   This happens in other masculine arenas as well.  For instance, research has shown that only the most competent women majoring in ""masculine"" fields like math and computer science remain in those majors.  Other women, earning average grades, are much more likely to change majors.  Men in these fields are not subject to the same self-assessment biases.  And this might be why we end up with Donald Trumps: men convinced they belong in politics, when they might be better off elsewhere. It takes an incredible degree of confidence to presume one is fit to run for president.  True, few women run for the office, but part of what might be a process of self-selection in which none but the extremely qualified run.  The same self-assessment process might be different among men, which could be why candidates like Donald Trump run.   Trump lacks the kind of intellectual humility the public ought to expect from presidential candidates.  And while Trump campaigns by telling the nation ""We're weak"" and ""I'm strong,"" perhaps his greatest failing is believing that he doesn't have any weaknesses even if that belief helps him gain support for his campaign. We'll never know what kind of president William Henry Harrison would have been.  He didn't live long enough to show us.  But the tactics that got him into office are ugly.  And imagining similar tactics used to justify war, economic reform, education reform or health care reform should scare us.   Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"In 2011 vote, a post-partisan populism","This week's election was more than a victory for public employee unions, immigrant rights advocates and reproductive justice activists.  This election marks the victory of a new politics in America, an emerging populism that is neither left nor right, Republican nor Democrat, but is fiercely pro-worker, pro-community, pro-opportunity and pro-American dream.  It all started when the disillusioned right and the disillusioned left came together. Tuesday night, they tied the knot.   Americans were hungry for a different type of politics in 2008.  The election of Barack Obama, our nation's first black president and a strong centrist, came about through millions of unlikely voters and first-time voters pulling the lever for a new political direction in America.  And yet, whether because of his own personality faults or because of the change-resistant molasses that is Washington politics, Obama was unable to bring about the change his supporters expected. Then the tea party galvanized millions of Americans who were angry that our government bailed out Wall Street while letting working families and small businesses sink.  Like candidate Obama, the tea party asserted that government was broken.  Obama showed he couldn't fix it; the tea party counterproductively showered its support on extremist candidates bent on breaking government even more. And so we find ourselves in 2011, ordinary Americans of every political stripe fed up that our economy and political system are rigged to help Wall Street and the superrich while blocking opportunity for the rest of us.  Tea party supporters and Obama backers may use different language to voice these critiques, but make no mistake, their frustration is more similar than not.   Despite Occupy Wall Street being launched by left-leaning activists, the 99% movement it inspired is supported by conservative, liberal and independent Americans from all walks of life.  So while the ballot measure vote against Ohio's anti-collective bargaining law is certainly a rebuff to Republicans, it's not necessarily a victory for Democrats. Community-based organizations and unions led the campaign to defend the right of public workers to organize.  Democratic machines wrote a few checks, but Obama and others have been relatively invisible in responding to anti-union attacks over the last year.     Thus, the outcome in Ohio is a resounding victory not for the Democrats but for ordinary working folks who see their interests best protected not by government or by big business but by banding together with their fellow workers and community members.   By the same token, any attempt to paint Ohio's outcome along traditional ideological lines is belied by voters enacting a measure allowing the state to opt out of the mandate aspect of the health care reform law, even though it's a largely symbolic gesture because federal law pre-empts it. Similarly, in Mississippi, voters struck down an amendment to the state's constitution that would have conferred ""personhood"" status on embryos after conception.  A total victory for liberal Democrats in Mississippi?  Guess again.  Voters also approved a law requiring potential voters to show a government-issued photo ID, which many advocates see as an anti-immigrant voter suppression law.  They also sent an archconservative to the governor's mansion. Arizona voters recalled State Senate president Russell Pearce, author of the state's extreme anti-immigrant measure SB 1070, replacing him with a Democrat.  But voters in Virginia handed control of their statehouse to Republicans, although the vote was so close a recount is expected.   Our  two leading political parties have blatantly failed us.  Record unemployment, record personal and political debt, a crippled housing market, crumbling public education, runaway costs of health care and food -- all while Washington continues business as usual and Wall Street racks up record profits and bonuses.   The recent anti-incumbency streak added to the varied outcomes in this last round of voting makes clear  the American people are furious with both parties, seeing Democrats and Republicans as too beholden to big business and special interests.  This leaves an ideological void that social movements and grassroots organizations fill as they have during our nation's past, when the political system has not met the needs of the people.  Politics is shifting away from Washington, away from red and blue dichotomies, and toward the heartland of America, where the shared experience of economic fear and insecurity is far more defining than the party registration on a piece of paper.   It's unclear what direction this will take -- as the elections show, post-partisan populism is firing in all directions.  But it may explain why the 99% movement is simultaneously spreading like wildfire and vague as to its long-term agenda. After all, the 99% of everyday Americans aren't just protesting the status quo, they're building a new political vision for our nation."
The health care plan (almost) everyone hates,"Health care reform could mark the first serious legislative crisis for Trumpism.    President Donald Trump exploited anger at Obamacare to get elected -- that was smart. His mistake was to promise to replace it with something that would deliver the best of everything: high coverage, low costs.  Trump attacked Obamacare on the campaign trail, but not for any coherently conservative reasons. His goal, unlike that of orthodox conservatives, was never to shrink government for the sake of shrinking government, but rather to redirect its resources towards his people, his kind of Americans. Obamacare should be repealed, he said, but with the caveat that it had to be replaced by something that would be both cheap and cover the working class. That's what he ran on, that's what he won on. The reality is that high coverage and low costs are contradictory aims. The Congressional Budget Office suggests that attempting both will result in neither: its analysis of the Republicans' American Health Care Act (AHCA) says that 24 million more people will be uninsured by 2026 and that some older citizens' premiums will jump. Turns out that you can have bread, you can have circuses, but you can't have both. This drama has a long history. Back in 2009, when Obamacare was first put to Congress, the Republicans leapt on the Tea Party bandwagon. This was a natural alliance between anxious consumers and conservatives who feared that getting the government even more involved in health care would lead to higher prices. They were right to worry. Just days before the 2016 election, it was announced that Obamacare premiums were rising by an average of 25%. In many counties of Arizona, for example, there was only one provider on the Obamacare exchanges left, and costs were reported to have more than doubled. Now Trump is facing the real problem, which is that his ""something for everyone"" philosophy does not translate well into government, particularly a government running out of cash. Trump has demanded from Congress a huge tax cut and a massive increase in defense spending. Money will have to be saved, but how?  Step forward Paul Ryan with the AHCA, which at its heart is an attempt to make Obamacare more economical rather than abolish it altogether. It's a first step, say its defenders, one that will still keep a lot of poor people covered, cut out rules that stifle competition, raise a few costs to improve the fiscal position and cut $337 billion over 10 years. A nice nip and tuck. Isn't that what Republicans want? No. Not the moderate Republicans who represent constituencies with small majorities, at least. How can they possibly support an act that either fails to insure their voters or causes their premiums to rise -- even if, as the Congressional Budget Office assessed, they might eventually fall again?  To keep the support of Trumpite, working-class voters, they urge moderation. But moderation, in turn, will alienate the conservative Republicans -- in Congress and elsewhere -- who despise the AHCA because they see it as an imitation of Obamacare. The conservatives have a point. The AHCA is a reform that goes far enough to hurt people without going far enough to make things better. The conservative Republican argument is that only when the government liberalizes the market and empowers consumers with lower taxes -- will the costs of health care fall. Greater coverage, they argue, is best achieved through health care becoming so cheap -- thanks to competition -- that anyone can afford it.  The tragedy of American health care is cost. Consumers are charged crazy amounts and have little power to do anything about it. The socialist solution, which is practiced in Britain, is for the government to take complete control of health care and regulate prices. The free market solution would be to get government out of health care altogether; let healthy competition drive down bills.  Obamacare is part of a long tradition of the US stumbling between socialism and the free market, delivering not the best of both worlds but, very often, the worst. Instead of bringing the costs of the health care market down, the US system now subsidizes consumers who would otherwise struggle to afford its products. With the Republicans in control, now ought to be the best time to enact a total reform of health care -- but it looks like it won't happen. Partly because of worries about alienating the voters and because Republicans like Ryan aren't on board with a fully free market approach. But also because the logic of Trump-style populism has limited the conversation. Rather than challenge the philosophy behind Obamacare, Trump really only challenged its implementation. He was a candidate for a more generous version of the status quo, and his populist approach threw away an enormous opportunity to rethink the underlying principles of how American health care operates. The most damning irony is that in trying to serve as many masters as it can, the AHCA is alienating almost everyone. Rather than each constituency group seeing something they want in it, they see only the things that are missing. And this is an important point that Trump will come to learn in time: even if bad policy is popular on the campaign trail, it is guaranteed eventually to become unpopular in government. Trump is correct, health care is ""unbelievably complex"" -- too complex, I suspect, to be reformed by a populist."
John Kasich: The time for bipartisanship is now,"Americans are relying on leaders in Washington to fix our health care problems, but if recent history is any indication, the search for solutions in the current environment will inevitably lead to an unproductive partisan standoff. Hopefully, members of Congress will learn from their turbulent town hall meetings that the American people are finally having their fill of that gridlock. Sadly, the health care debate is but one battle in what seems to be an endless partisan war, and the battlefields are every issue of importance facing our nation -- from the economy to foreign policy. How did things get so off track?   It wasn't always this way. When I was chairman of the House Budget Committee in the 1990s, we were able to reform Pentagon spending, pass welfare reform and balance the federal budget for the first time in decades and largely because Democrats and Republicans made a commitment to work together. We disagreed and debated, but at the end of the day we agreed to meaningful reforms that strengthened our country. That change was possible only with bipartisan support. In more recent times, as governor of Ohio, I've seen the same kind of across-the-aisle approach lead to positive progress in addressing some of our state's most perplexing problems: police-community relations, human trafficking, infant mortality, underperforming schools, highway infrastructure, skyrocketing college tuition and so many others.  And yes, unlike Washington, we've even made progress with health care reform, within the framework we're given by federal law. One of my first steps as governor was to reform Medicaid and rein in costs. Working with both sides of the aisle in our state legislature, we have been able to bend the cost curve of Medicaid from more than 9% annual growth to below 3%.   Today, we're providing better care, Ohio's Medicaid program is stable, per-member spending is flat over six years, and we've been able to extend health care coverage to more than 700,000 low-income adults.   Health care is not a Republican or Democrat problem. And there isn't a strictly one-sided, partisan solution. We've shown in Ohio that tough problems can be resolved if people work together. That approach can and should be a model for Washington. To resolve the current health care stalemate, Senate Republicans should reach out across the aisle, and their Democrat colleagues should accept the opportunity to achieve a lasting solution to these issues. If both sides choose to work together, we can fix America's health care system in a way that preserves coverage, stabilizes the market, reforms Medicaid and controls costs. Let Ohio and other states show the way.   On health care reform and a myriad of other issues facing our nation, it's time for Republicans and Democrats to come together, end the civil war in Washington and fight for all Americans.  Progress on health care can set a pattern for bipartisan cooperation on all the other problems that Americans so desperately want Washington to get off their partisan backsides and resolve."
What would a second Obama term bring?,"Republicans warn that if President Barack Obama wins a second term, he will push forward with an expansive domestic liberal agenda that makes his existing record look like child's play. During the victory speech that followed the Michigan primary, Mitt Romney warned that ""a second term Obama would be unrestrained by the demands of re-election.""   If you didn't like health care and financial regulation, the Republicans are saying, then you really won't like what happens when things turn leftward after 2012. No longer forced to think about independent voters and suburban moderates, Obama will allow his true liberal values to shine, the theory goes.   But there is little evidence that Obama would move sharply to the left in a second term, regardless of which party controls Congress. Most likely, the president would focus his energy on protecting the programs that Congress enacted in his first term, namely health care, while he would turn his attention to narrower issues, such as specific infrastructure projects, that seem politically viable. In addition, Obama might co-opt some Republican themes by moving forward on Social Security reform and deficit reduction.   Why? Despite the Republican claims about Obama being a big-government liberal, the truth of the matter is that he is a pragmatic centrist to the core.  Repeatedly, Obama has frustrated liberals by forcing them to accept compromises on almost every issue, ranging from the type of health care reform that he proposed to the size of the economic stimulus. He has continued many of President George W. Bush's programs, including TARP and the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans (although he advocates getting rid of the tax cuts when they expire in 2013). Obama has usually embraced market-based approaches to dealing with domestic problems.  According to Ezra Klein of The Washington Post, Obama has been the ""most polarizing moderate ever."" Klein cites a scholarly study, which shows that Obama is the most moderate Democrat since World War II.     Equally important, it is rare for second-term Democratic presidents to do more on domestic policy -- in terms of passing big ticket legislation -- than they did in the first. The record of the 20th century shows that presidents narrow their legislative ambitions and, when they don't, they are forced to pull back. Woodrow Wilson started his presidency with sweeping initiatives in 1913, but his second term was consumed by the demands of World War I.  In the same way, President Franklin Roosevelt came out swinging in his first term as he and the Democratic Congress remade American government. The high mark came in 1935, when Roosevelt signed the Wagner Act that legitimated unions as well as the Social Security Act. Following a fierce backlash in 1937, Roosevelt scaled back his domestic proposals, after which wartime policies became the focus of his effort as well. Though he pushed through Congress some big changes in government during war, such as price controls, his ability to obtain major domestic programs such as Social Security diminished. President Harry Truman ramped up his demands after 1948, emboldened by his unexpected victory against Republican Thomas Dewey, but fell back quickly when the conservative coalition of Democrats and Republicans knocked down proposals such as national health care and used anti-communist rhetoric to put Democrats on the defensive.    Lyndon Johnson chose not to run for another term in the 1968 election, though based on the revival of the conservative coalition that took place in 1966 and his growing focus on taxes, inflation and deficits, it is unlikely he would have obtained much more in the way of bold initiatives such as Medicare.  And President Bill Clinton never replicated the effort in 1993 to pass national health insurance. Instead, his second term focused on deficit reduction, Medicare reform, implementing welfare reform and narrower measures such as the creation of the v-chip to protect under-aged television viewers from edgy programs and the expansion of Medicaid to cover children.   Nothing in Obama's record or the history of 20th century Democratic presidents suggests that a second term would be unrestrained. American politics does not allow for such freedom given the role that Congress plays in the political process and the desire of presidents to retain strong approval ratings. Even if Democrats retook control of both chambers, Senate Republicans would continue to exert enormous influence as a result of the filibuster. And when presidents do big things in their first term, such as health care, they need to make sure that in their second term those programs are protected and set up effectively. If the president is granted a second term, voters would probably see a leader who is more timid than the first term Obama, someone who might even embrace some Republican issues along the way.

Aging boomers need health care law,"Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules on health care reform, the justices have one thing in common, and one thing in common with a growing cohort of Americans: They are aging.   America faces an unprecedented wave of aging as members of the iconic baby boomer generation turn 65. This year alone, 4 million Americans will join the growing ranks of senior citizens. The Affordable Care Act strengthened the Medicare system that this growing senior population relies on.   Health care reform reduces the cost of prescription drugs, brings down costs for patients using private Medicare supplements and increases access to free preventative services. The Affordable Care Act makes health care more affordable for senior citizens and ensures that doctors are compensated fairly for their services.   While Medicare certainly needs adjusting, if the law is overturned, the challenges of Medicare financing will only get worse.   For the millions of senior citizens and about-to-be seniors in America the improvements brought by  health care reform are just an important first step. We must protect the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, but much more is needed to support our rapidly growing older adult population to help them live independently, at home and in our communities with dignity. A vital home care work force has developed to meet these needs, and its interests are inextricably bound to the future of health care.  The average hourly wage of a home care worker in the United States is less than $10 per hour. Poverty wages and a lack of benefits, training and career pathways mean turnover is constant. The work force can barely meet the current need for care, supports and services, let alone what's to come. More families are turning to immigrant women of color to provide care for their loved ones.   These women work tirelessly to feed and bathe our nation's senior citizens, serve as a go-between with family and doctors, count medication, even take care of pets, and yet they are denied basic wages, let alone benefits, worker protections and pathways to citizenship. In fact, one out of two direct care workers supplements his or her income with food stamps, Medicaid or public benefits, compounding our overall challenge. News explainer: Health care's big four issues: What the justices are tackling We need to create more jobs in America, address the need for home care, and improve the quality of care jobs all at the same time. In so doing, we can create precisely the type of economic growth we need in this moment.  These are issues that concern us all including, ultimately, Supreme Court justices. Of course, the Supreme Court justices have lifetime appointments that include access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, one of the largest insurance pools in the country, which ensures the jurists aren't subject to the sorts of limits for pre-existing conditions and inflated premiums that most insured Americans have long faced.  And if they choose to leave the bench, the justices can opt to keep their coverage -- meaning they won't have to rely on Medicare to nearly the extent most elder Americans do.  News: Timeline of the health care law   But someday, they may want an in-home care worker to help them through the challenges of aging. The Affordable Care Act was a great leap forward in improving a health care system that isn't working well for senior citizens, workers or any of us. With our senior population growing by the second, or every eight seconds to be exact, we need to move forward quickly toward more improvements, not roll back the ones we've made. According to polls, the American people know that the Supreme Court won't rule based on the Constitution alone. Politics clearly influence such decisions. But if the justices would just think of themselves as senior citizens and soon-to-be-seniors, they would uphold the Affordable Care Act for the sake of older Americans, care workers and our shared future.

The GOP's real problem is ideology,"Republicans are consoling themselves with the claim that President Barack Obama didn't win a mandate Tuesday night, even if he did renew his White House lease for another four years. They are fooling themselves, however, if they think the 2012 election merely ratified the political status quo. More than just a personal victory for Obama, the outcome was an unmistakable defeat for GOP ideology. Disgruntled conservatives, of course, are already dressing Mitt Romney for the part of fall guy. But this is the politics of evasion. Sooner or later, GOP realists will have to reappraise the party's message rather than shoot its messenger.    That message was a call for rolling back government. Intoxicated by a potent brew of resurgent libertarian dogma and intense personal animus toward Obama, Republicans vowed to undo his major achievements: health care reform, new rules for financial markets, the regulation of carbon emissions, higher fuel economy standards for autos, and so on.  Conservatives also railed against an alleged epidemic of dependency on government; called for deep spending cuts (but no tax hikes) to reduce public deficits; threatened to roll back women's reproductive rights; and took extreme positions on tax, immigration and energy issues that seemed calculated to thwart bipartisan compromise. Such tea party radicalism seemed to work in 2010, amid acute public dissatisfaction with the slow pace of economic recovery. But a different electorate -- larger, more moderate and more Democratic -- rejected the conservative vision this time. In effect, the pragmatic center reasserted itself on Tuesday. According to exit polls, a plurality of voters, 41%, were moderates, and they favored Obama by 15 points. In general, voters viewed Obama as more for the middle class and Republicans as tilting toward the interests of the rich. They did not accept Romney's claims that Obama has been an incompetent economic manager; nearly half the voters instead blamed the weak economy on his predecessor. Opinion: Obama's critics, repudiated at last And for all the GOP's ceaseless demonization of Obamacare, the issue seemed to work in the president's favor. Exit polls say health care registered as the voters' second most important concern (albeit a distant second to the economy and jobs). Obama won massively among these voters, which suggests that Republican promises to kill health care reform may have backfired by spurring greater intensity among its advocates. Some Republicans point hopefully to the fact that the election barely changed the existing composition of political forces in Washington. That's true, but this was an election they could have won. With stubbornly high unemployment and the president's low approval ratings (often below the previously supposed ""can't win"" threshold of 50%), the Republicans had objective reality on their side. Instead, they blew it by indulging in pathological partisanship and ideological hubris. The big question now is whether Republicans will accept the lessons of their defeat or take refuge in the usual alibis. The biggest lesson, of course, is they lost because they picked the wrong candidate -- a Massachusetts moderate who didn't given the country a clear choice between undiluted conservatism and Obama's alleged ultra-liberalism. This electoral math is no better than Romney's budget math. America may list slightly to the center-right, but no party can cede the center and win. What Republicans really need is an analogue to the New Democrat movement of the 1990s -- a determined effort by moderates and pragmatists to reassert control over their party's agenda and electoral strategies. Whether they realize that is another matter: Democrats had to lose four out of five presidential elections between 1968 and 1992 before finally accepting that their message could no longer command electoral majorities. Opinion: Obama will get little time to celebrate Republicans don't have that luxury. Tuesday's results made it blindingly obvious that the GOP's political strategy of relying almost exclusively on white voters already has reached a dead end. As expected, white turnout was 72%, according to exit polls, two points down from 2008, and is projected to be two points lower in 2016. The GOP's bet on a kind of white identity politics -- which dates back to Ronald Reagan's successful 1966 run for governor in California and was ruthlessly perfected by Richard Nixon in 1972 -- is played out. Meanwhile, what the National Journal's Ronald Brownstein calls the Democrats' ""coalition of the ascendant"" is growing by about the same amount every four years. This coalition includes minorities, young voters and women (especially single women), along with highly educated white professionals. As they pore over election returns, expect GOP strategists to look especially ruefully at Latino voters. Obama won them by 71% to 27%, according to exit polls, improving on his 2008 performance. Assuming that Latinos would focus mainly on their economic struggles and ignore the GOP's harshly anti-immigrant stance, proved to be a major miscalculation. A conservative governing philosophy centered on exploiting white voters' sense of cultural dispossession is a formula for political marginalization, if not demographic suicide. Any honest post-mortem of the 2012 election should lead Republican strategists to this inescapable conclusion: It's the ideology, stupid."
Why a Republican Senate could make a difference,"In homes all across America, working parents struggle to pay their bills at the end of the month. College graduates move back in with their parents because student loan debts are so high. Young families juggle two jobs just to afford their rising health care premiums.    These are the problems Americans face every single day, in every state across the country. As the heads of the Republican communications offices in the House and the Senate, it's our job to listen to these problems and share Republican solutions.  Our party has heard Americans' concerns, and that's why we've put forward hundreds of bills to help grow the economy, create jobs, expand opportunity and give American families hope for tomorrow.  Our conversations with people back home, from the supermarket to the church pews to the doctor's office, have helped us develop legislative solutions that will make life better for Americans in every corner of this country.   The House Republican majority has passed one jobs bill after another -- bills like the Small Business Capital Access and Job Preservation Act, which eliminates costly regulations for small and medium-size businesses, and which passed the House with the support of 36 Democrats.  The House passed the America's Small Business Tax Relief Act, which gives small businesses more certainty by making permanent the maximum expensing allowance at $500,000, and the measure passed  with the support of 53 Democrats. And House Republicans advanced the bipartisan Hire More Heroes Act, which would help America's veterans get back to work by excluding them from Obamacare's employer mandate threshold and therefore incentivizing businesses to hire them, and that legislation passed the House with almost unanimous Democratic support.   And those are just the beginning. Unfortunately, once these bills go to the Democrat-led Senate, their progress comes to an abrupt halt. Scores of jobs bills and other important legislation are currently gathering dust on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's desk.   The same thing has happened to Senate Republicans.   Senate Republicans have put forward numerous bills to help create jobs and opportunities and solve the challenges facing working families, but Reid has resolutely refused to allow any of them to come to the floor. And Senate Republicans have repeatedly been prevented from offering amendments to Democrat bills, including amendments that would have garnered bipartisan support, like an amendment to repeal Obamacare's burdensome medical device tax.  While the Democratic majority in Washington refuses to debate the challenges facing the American people, Republicans continue to introduce solutions. While Reid ties up the Senate with political gimmicks and boutique bills designed to appeal to Democrats' far-left base -- like this month's effort to erase the free speech clause of the First Amendment with a proposed constitutional amendment on campaign contributions that would have empowered incumbent politicians to suppress the speech of their constituents -- Republicans move forward pro-jobs, pro-growth legislation that will get Americans back to work.  While Democrats stand in the way of 21st-century solutions that will move our economy forward, Republicans continue to advance them.   The contrast between the two parties couldn't be more clear: Republicans are working to create jobs for Americans. Democrats are working to save their own. American families can't afford to keep waiting for Senate Democrats to get their act together. Unemployment is high, and jobs and opportunities are few and far between. Obamacare has driven up health care premiums and significantly reduced health care choices for some Americans. Gas prices have risen by 84% since President Obama took office. And household income has fallen by about $2,600.     Right now, too many Americans are struggling to make ends meet, support their families, pay their premiums and get back to work. In fact, nearly one in three Americans says their financial situation has gotten worse in the past year. We want to make it better.     Americans need solutions. But as long as Reid continues to obstruct meaningful legislation in the Senate, they're not going to get them.   The American people should not have to endure another two-year solutions blockade from Senate Democrats.  The Senate needs a new majority with leaders who understand that they were elected to govern and who will work with the House to actually pass legislation to address America's challenges and provide the relief hard-working American families need: more jobs, increased take-home pay and more opportunities for advancement, expanded workplace flexibility, lower energy prices and real health care reform that will lower costs and put patients in charge.  It's our hope that when Congress reconvenes next year, there will be new leadership in the Senate. We need leaders who will create opportunities, not stand in the way of them. We're ready and waiting to get things done for the American people. We just need willing partners.     Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Why the health care reform law is unconstitutional,"This week, the U.S. Supreme Court considers the case challenging the Obama administration health care plan's requirement that most Americans purchase a government-approved health insurance plan by 2014. The court should rule that this individual mandate is unconstitutional. To do otherwise would give Congress almost unlimited power.  The federal government argues that three provisions of the Constitution -- the commerce clause, the tax clause and the ""necessary and proper"" clause -- authorize the health care mandate.  The commerce clause gives Congress authority to regulate interstate commerce. Since the 1930s, Supreme Court decisions have interpreted the commerce clause broadly.  But every previous case expanding the commerce power involved some sort of ""economic activity,"" such as operating a business or consuming a product. Failure to purchase health insurance is neither commerce nor an interstate activity. Indeed, it is the absence of commerce. If Congress could use that clause to regulate mere failure to buy a product on the grounds that such inaction has an economic effect, there would be no structural limits to its power.  Any decision to do anything is necessarily a decision not  to do something else that might have an economic effect. If I spend an hour sleeping, I thereby choose not to spend it working or shopping. As the lower court decision in this case explained, the government's position ""amounts to an argument that the mere fact of an individual's existence substantially affects interstate commerce, and therefore Congress may regulate them at every point of their life."" Read a transcript of Monday's Supreme Court arguments Defenders of the insurance mandate claim that health care is a special case because everyone eventually uses it. But this argument relies on shifting the focus from health insurance to health care.  A similar rhetorical ploy can justify any other mandate, including even the ""broccoli purchase mandate."" Not everyone eats broccoli.  But everyone participates in the market for food. Similarly, a mandate requiring all Americans to purchase a car can be justified because virtually everyone participates in the transportation market. The government also claims that health care is different because producers are sometimes required to give free emergency services to the uninsured. But why is this fact constitutionally relevant? The answer seems to be that failure to buy insurance thereby has adverse economic effects on producers. Put that way, failure to buy health insurance turns out to be no different from failure to buy any other product. Any time someone fails to purchase any product, producer profits are lower than they would be otherwise. The government's tax-clause argument is similarly flawed. It asserts that the individual mandate isn't really a restriction on freedom, it's just a tax; violators are forced to pay a fine. If this logic is correct, it would justify any mandate enforced by a monetary fine, whether it be for broccoli, a car or anything else. Every lower court to have considered this constitutional issue has ruled that the mandate is not a tax but a penalty. As President  Barack Obama acknowledged in 2009, ""for us to say that you've got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase."" Finally, the government relies on the clause that gives Congress the power to ""make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution"" other powers the Constitution grants it. The federal government argues that the insurance mandate is a ""necessary"" element of its regulation of the health care market under the commerce clause.  The court has previously defined ""necessary"" broadly as anything that might be ""useful"" or ""convenient."" But even if the mandate is necessary, it is not ""proper."" The court has previously ruled that these are two separate requirements and both must be met. What makes a federal law ""proper""? At the very least, a proper law cannot depend on a rationale that gives Congress virtually unlimited power. As James Madison said: ""Whatever meaning this clause may have, none can be admitted that would give an unlimited discretion to Congress.""  If the ""necessary and proper"" clause allows Congress to adopt the individual mandate, the same logic would justify almost any other mandate. Virtually every mandate has some economic effect and could be portrayed as a ""useful or convenient"" way to regulate some market. A broccoli mandate could be defended as an effort to regulate the market in food. The threat to liberty raised by this case isn't just theoretical. Many industries would be happy to lobby for laws requiring people to buy their products, and Congress has a long history of enacting special-interest legislation.  In a recent decision, the Supreme Court unanimously emphasized that constitutional constraints on federal power protect state rights as well as ""the liberty of the individual."" Little will be left of that protection if the justices uphold the individual mandate. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.  Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Obama's efforts on climate change may not be enough,"When Barack Obama took office in 2009, it was clear that if he could do four big things, his presidency would probably be judged a success. The first, of course, was to pull the country out of its desperate economic crisis. The second was to extricate it from the Iraq War. The third was to finally achieve comprehensive health care reform. And the fourth was to make meaningful progress on arresting global warming. This last challenge was in some ways easiest to ignore: While you were shoveling snow last month, you probably didn't feel the urgency of climate change, though according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, it was in fact the fourth-hottest January since record-keeping began. But over time, it could prove more consequential than the other three combined.  Five years later, Obama's record on it is a mixed one. He won't get any significant legislation on the matter passed through this Congress -- or any legislation at all, to be honest. But using the power of the presidency, he may just have a bigger impact on global warming than most anyone predicted. That's the good news. The bad news is, it almost certainly won't be enough. It's easy to forget how the political environment has changed compared with just a few years ago. Before Obama took office, it looked as though Democrats and Republicans might work together to do something about climate change. Sen. John McCain had sponsored a bill to create a cap and trade system for carbon emissions, which at the time was considered a conservative solution to the problem, as it utilized market forces to control emissions. Many other prominent Republicans supported cap and trade as well.   In 2008, Newt Gingrich and Nancy Pelosi starred together in an ad imploring the country to address climate change.  Yet today, opposition to doing anything about climate change has become the default Republican position. Even though many rank-and-file Republicans understand that the planet is warming, the tea party view has come to dominate their party. Climate denialism approaches the status of gospel truth among many Republicans in Congress, and it's echoed regularly on the major conservative media outlets, from Fox News to the most popular talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.  As hatred of Obama and anything he touches has become the single highest Republican value, there is zero chance that they will join in any effort to address climate change. This has left the administration with two choices: do nothing or use the executive branch's regulatory power to reduce carbon emissions wherever it could.  It chose the second path. The administration's latest move, which the President announced Tuesday, is a new measure mandating an increase in fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which account for 20% of carbon emissions from transportation despite making up only 4% of all vehicles on the road. This follows on a truly historic regulation the administration created in 2012, which will double fuel efficiency for passenger cars by 2025, to an average of 54.5 miles per gallon.  And few people remember how much the 2009 stimulus bill focused on climate change. Time magazine's Michael Grunwald, who wrote a book about the bill, argues that it was the largest green initiative in American history, pouring $90 billion into clean energy technologies, energy efficiency, upgrades to the electrical grid and a whole host of other efforts that could have a significant impact on carbon emissions over time. In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency officially made it policy to treat carbon emissions as a danger to human health and thus subject to its regulation. This January, the EPA published emission standards for new power plants that make it all but impossible for coal plants to be built (even though few coal plants were planned, given the recent natural gas boom). Its next task is to set new limits for the existing power plants that account for so much of our emissions. Finally, it's clear that climate change will play a significant role in the administration's foreign policy efforts during Obama's second term. Secretary of State John Kerry has long been an advocate for action, and as he told  an audience in Indonesia,  climate change is a threat as great as terrorism, poverty or weapons proliferation. American efforts to reduce emissions will be for naught if other countries don't take action as well -- China passed the U.S. a few years ago to become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and continues to build coal plants at a furious pace --  and Kerry's tenure will be judged in no small part by how much progress he can make in this area. That all sounds like relatively good news. The administration has worked on many fronts to reduce carbon emissions, which have declined in three out of the five years Obama has been in office.   That's in part due to the fracking boom that has made natural gas competitive with coal, but many of the administration's steps could yield significant long-term benefits. Even so, these measures will get us only a fraction of the distance we need to go in order to make a real impact on climate change. Ask a climate scientist, and you'll get a depressing take on our future, where things like moving from coal to natural gas do only the tiniest bit to delay what could be catastrophic consequences of climate change in decades to come. NOAA has also noted that 2013 tied for the fourth-hottest year on record. So we can give Obama credit for what he's done, and he should certainly keep trying to do more, even in the face of unceasing opposition from Republicans and well-heeled interest groups. Politics, as the old saying has it, is the art of the possible. Truly fixing the problem in a comprehensive way, given our current political environment, may never have been possible. Years from now, we're likely to look back and say that Obama gave it a good shot. But it wasn't nearly enough.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Give patients end-of-life options,"The urban dictionary defines ""cheech"" as a verb used among physicians in training that refers to the act of ordering every conceivable radiological and laboratory test for a patient, often to diagnose a condition that once diagnosed is untreatable.  Thirty years ago, the macabre joke during my three-month stint as an intern in the medical ICU was first cheech, then death.   I remember sitting at the bedside of a frail, older woman with dementia dying of septic shock.  A litany of subspecialists had rounded earlier in the day, but no one said what was so obvious. She was dying.  Instead, I sat at her bedside at 4:30 a.m. watching the sun rise over Narragansett Bay, increasing vasopressors to try to maintain her blood pressure.  Instead of being surrounded by her family and loved ones, the only person at her bedside was an exhausted intern who had never met the woman in bed No. 2 until the night before. This was simply wrong.  Why were we rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic instead of ensuring that her death was peaceful and that she was surrounded by her family? Intensive Care Units save some patients and play an important role in our health care system. But the overarching concern is, ""Are we talking to frail, older patients and their families at the right time about when to stop (or avoid) ICU care and recurrent hospitalizations?"" Decisions about hospitalizations and ICU admission must weigh the quality vs. the quantity of life.   Opinion: End-of-life planning eases suffering These decisions must reflect a patient's informed wishes and goals for care, be based on what the patient and/or family understand about the medical condition -- their hopes and goals -- and educate them about the prognosis and treatment options to arrive at a care plan that honors realistic patient goals of care. Our research published in the February 8 edition of JAMA finds that hospice is now part of mainstream medical care, with nearly half of older Medicare beneficiaries receiving hospice services. However, that's only half the story. More than a quarter (28.4%) of these people had the benefit of hospice for three days or less, and nearly half (40.3%) were in an ICU immediately before.   Indeed, contrasting end of life care in 2000 vs. 2009, in spite of a doubling of hospice use, we found more ICU care, more repeat hospitalizations and more patient transfers from hospital to another health care setting in the last three days of life.  Does this pattern of care reflect the informed wishes of dying patients and their families? Our research does not provide the answer to this important question. But it is something we really need to know.     On the face of it, our research findings should not be surprising. You get what you pay for.  All the financial incentives in fee-for-service Medicare are aligned to induce more hospitalizations, more ICU care and late hospice referrals.  As we try to reform our health care system to provide care that is patient centered and care that improves the health of our population, we need to do a better job of paying for quality rather than simply paying for another day in the ICU, particularly if it does not change the inevitable.   Yet during the debate over health-care reform, a proposal to pay health-care providers for advance care planning was eliminated from the legislation based on the mistaken argument that promoting shared decision making with the goals of honoring patient wishes was equivalent to creating a ""death panel."" The key is that decisions be based upon discussions that weigh the quantity vs. the quality of life reflect informed patient preferences.  The evidence to date suggests we are falling short of that goal.  We've previously shown that 11.6% of family members felt pressured by a physician to put a feeding tube in a dying patient with advanced dementia, and about 10% reported that no one discussed that decision with them.  A recent study of two ICUs that differed on the aggressiveness of care provided found contrasting decision-making styles: a futility based decision-making  process where one talks to the patient only when death is certain in the aggressive ICU vs. a shared decision making model where physicians work with patients and families early in the ICU stay to arrive at a decision that is consistent with the patient's prognosis and goals of care in the ICU.  We must have publicly reported data on the degree in which our health care system delivers on the promise of patient centered care -- that health care providers are informing patients and their families of the expected prognosis and treatment options, helping them in making these difficult decisions, and that patients are provided the right care at the right time, in the right place, and consistent with their informed wishes. We must hold our health care system accountable to the goal that medical decisions should reflect patient informed goals and values. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Obama's final report card: Did he live up to his promise?,"Barack Obama ends his two terms in the White House on January 20. Here are 11 takes on his legacy, ranging from health care reform to climate change, immigration to his effect on women and families and beyond.The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors. Julian Zelizer: Obama's tenuous 'transformational' legacy When Barack Obama won his primary contest against Hillary Clinton in 2008, he summed up his quest for the presidency in a speech in St. Paul, Minnesota: ""If we are willing to work for it, and fight for it, and believe in it, then I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth. This was the moment - this was the time - when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves, and our highest ideals.""  Elected as a transformational figure, the first African-American president soon had to face the reality of partisanship in Washington and of the limits of presidential power. And as he ends his final term in office, Obama's legacy hangs in the balance. While Obama wasn't able to achieve many of the promises — such as ending the bitter partisanship of Capitol Hill — from the perspective of 2017, he leaves behind a significant record of progress on many of the causes he described in that St. Paul speech. He helped to bring back the nation from a severe economic and financial crisis, while moving forward with a bold domestic agenda that vastly expanded the role of government in health care and financial regulation. For all the talk about President-elect Trump theoretically saving 750 Carrier jobs, Obama's economic stimulus program, including the auto bailout, actually revived the entire economy and put it back on a pattern of growth. Even when congressional Republicans obstructed everything after 2010, Obama used executive power to make some progress on issues like climate change. Despite many problems overseas — the chaos in Syria and the rise of ISIS — Obama pushed against the muscular approach to foreign policy embraced by his predecessor George W. Bush, exhibiting a more restrained and cautious approach to intervention overseas, with varying results (something that our writers here will explore). He put into place a historic nuclear arms agreement with Iran, and participated in the Paris Climate Agreement. We don't know what this will all look like even within a year.   Some of the threat that this legacy faces is a product of Obama's own failure as a party builder. Unlike Franklin Roosevelt, who left behind a robust New Deal coalition that could protect and expand his programs once he was gone from office, Obama ends his term with Democrats in much worse shape than they were when he started. Republicans now control the governor's house or the state legislative chamber in 44 states, with full control in 25 states. Nebraska is the exception because its legislature is nonpartisan. If Democrats want to make sure that his legacy does not fall apart, they will have to undertake some very serious party-rebuilding efforts from day one. That will be a priority, if they are to fight back as the GOP tries to dismantle the record that Obama has left behind. Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of ""Jimmy Carter"" and ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society."" He also is the co-host of the podcast ""Politics & Polls.""   Sabrina Corlette: He brought health care to 20 million As a US Senator, Barack Obama would have found it hard to imagine health reform as a signature domestic policy of an Obama presidency to come. Indeed, when the 2008 financial meltdown hit, health care understandably took a back seat to jobs and the economy. But President Obama couldn't get away from health reform. Mounting evidence that the US health care system was on an unsustainable track forced his administration to make health reform its first major domestic policy initiative.  The facts were unavoidable: insurance was largely inaccessible to millions of people with pre-existing health conditions, one-in-seven Americans were uninsured, medical debt was a chief cause of personal bankruptcy, and a highly inefficient health care system was swallowing an ever-growing proportion of the US economy -- over 17%  at the time President Obama took office. Reforming health care became not just a priority but an economic imperative. Obama put his presidency on the line to achieve it. When, in the midst of an exhausting and politically divisive legislative debate, senior advisors urged the President to cut a deal and walk away, he refused. Ultimately he signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, now called ""Obamacare,"" into law on March 23, 2010. It was, by any measure, an historic accomplishment.  US presidents since Harry Truman had attempted and failed to pass comprehensive health reform, but Obama did it. In spite of a rocky start and unmitigated opposition from Congressional leaders, the law has ended discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions, expanded coverage to 20 million mostly working class Americans, slowed the growth of health care costs, and created new incentives for providers to deliver higher quality care at a lower cost. Even with this progress, the law remains controversial. Many provisions are unpopular, particularly the penalty for people who don't maintain health coverage. Insurers have struggled financially in the law's new marketplaces, leading some to leave and many of those remaining to raise premiums. The law may be repealed. However, our nation's new leaders may find it harder than they think to unravel President Obama's namesake law and take coverage away from 20 million people. Final grade: A, for effort; B for execution Sabrina Corlette is a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. Follow her on Twitter.  Ana Navarro: What Democrats and Republicans can agree on What is President Obama's legacy on immigration? A mixed bag, at best. A huge disappointment, at worst.  Candidate Barack Obama promised in 2008 that he would pass immigration reform in the first six months of his first term. His supporters will tell you he was overwhelmed with the economic crisis and had to spend his chits on passing healthcare reform instead. His opponents will tell you he made a campaign promise to the Latino community and didn't keep his word. Bottom line, after two terms and eight years, there was no legislative immigration reform.  He did do some things. He deported a heck of a lot of people. One of his allies, Janet Murguia, head of National Council of La Raza, referred to him as the ""Deporter-in-Chief.""  He also signed some significant executive orders. One gave us DACA, which granted temporary status to undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. And another gave us DAPA, allowing temporary status for their parents. The latter was found unconstitutional and never implemented.  The former went into effect. About 665,000 young people are benefiting from DACA. But, and this is a big but, it can be revoked by President Donald Trump as soon as Day 1 of his administration. As a result, these people are living in fear and in limbo.  They do not know if they will be able to continue living and studying and working legally in the country they consider their own. They do not know if the rug will be pulled from under them by a new president. They do not know if they will ever be US citizens, or if they will deported to countries that many of them barely know.  So what's Obama's legacy on immigration? The DACA kids don't know, their friends and loved ones don't know. None of us know.  Final grade on immigration: C Since in my view, immigration is not much of an Obama legacy, which makes me sad, let's talk about his biggest legacy -- the indisputable thing we can all agree on: He was the first black president of the United States.  Folks, regardless of your political affiliation or gender or race or creed or age, the fact that Barack Obama was the first African-American elected to lead our nation is historically significant to our country. It is also personally significant to many of us. Did Obama's election usher in a post-racial era in America? No. It did not. There are still huge education and employment gaps between African-Americans and whites in the United States. Did it mean racism has ended? No, it did not. We've all seen shocking, racially motivated hate crimes -- whites against blacks, blacks against whites, and between every other color and ethnicity -- caught on camera in the last eight years.  But yes, President Obama's election was hugely symbolic. It meant so much to African-American boys and girls -- like 5 year-old Jacob Philadelphia, who wanted to know if President Obama's hair was like his -- to see someone that looked like them in the White House. They now know that one day they can grow up to be president.  It meant so much to 106-year-old Virginia McLaurin, born in the segregated South. She thought she would never live to see a black president. But she got to dance with a black president in the White House.  It meant so much to the young men participating in President Obama's initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which offers opportunities to boys and young men of color who want to get ahead. It meant so much to African-American mothers and fathers to hear a president talk about the realities, the fears, the challenges of growing up black in America. And it meant so much to many of us non-black Americans who acknowledge that there's is much work left to be done but hope President Obama's election was one more little step towards us being a more united nation and a better community.   Ana Navarro is a Republican strategist and commentator. Follow her on Twitter.  Douglas Holtz-Eakin:  Where's the economic growth? The Obama legacy is poor growth -- poor macroeconomic growth, poor productivity growth, and especially poor wage growth. Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings have grown at a minuscule annual rate of 0.25% since the recovery began in June 2009.  The failure to deliver a rising return to work has stressed American families and fed the populist political uprising. It is his most significant economic failure. That is certainly not how Obama wants to be remembered. His advocates repeatedly stress the deep recession he inherited, the reco"
"Lessons, from Walter White to LBJ","Walter White, the high school chemistry teacher turned meth dealer in the fictional TV series ""Breaking Bad,"" would seem to have little in common with the real-life President Lyndon B. Johnson, who played a celebrated part in the passage of the Civil Rights Act 50 years ago.  Yet Bryan Cranston, who played White and now stars as LBJ in a Broadway play, sees a common thread: ""They're both very powerful, strong-willed, smart and damaged. In both cases, ego had a large part of what downfall they had,"" Cranston said when I questioned him in a recent panel discussion. Last week, I had the pleasure of taking a group of 50 Princeton students to the new Broadway play ""All The Way,"" starring Cranston as Johnson. Written by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Robert Schenkkan, the play is a riveting portrait of one of the most important and controversial presidents in American history.   Besides great entertainment, ""All the Way"" also offers an excellent opportunity to think about some of the lessons we need to include in our civic education to younger Americans, some of the aspects of politics that often elude the textbooks. Among those lessons: Insider politics can be good: The era of insider politics had its virtues. In Johnson's time, politicians came to Washington for most of their career, spending their adult lives in the city and displaying a true passion for the political process.  This is difficult to understand in the post-Watergate landscape, when most elected officials spend their time railing against Washington, trying as hard as possible to have as little do with Capitol Hill as possible. While many put  down former President Jimmy Carter, most politicians still try to replicate the anti-politics campaign style that he perfected in 1976, where his major selling point was not being part of Washington's broken system. As a result of fundraising and cheap air travel, more politicians spend their time outside of the district or inside the halls of events filled with wealthy donors from whom they're trying to raise another buck.  Distrust in government is healthy and skepticism about Washington is well-deserved, but there was also something important about an era like the 1950s and 1960s when our nation's leaders lived and breathed the institutions of government.  In a long career in Washington, Johnson developed close relationships with other members of Congress and gained an intimate knowledge of all the issues, the history, and the arcane procedures that gave character to the city. His longstanding relationship with Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen, with whom he had worked closely throughout the 1950s when LBJ was Senate majority leader, enabled negotiations over civil rights to move forward.  Politics and policy are connected: Too often these days, politics is a dirty word. Television shows like ""Scandal,"" ""Homeland"" and ""House of Cards"" all present politics as a power game replete with maneuvering and manipulation.   (Sometimes life actually imitates art. Last week the House of Representatives took a ""House of Cards""-style vote. When a bill looked like it was going to face defeat, the House Republicans pulled the bill from the floor and members went back to their offices, waiting to hear what would come next. While they waited, leaders from both parties sneakily brought the bill back to the floor for a quick vote. The bill passed as most members sat in their office having no idea what was taking place.) But ""All the Way"" is a powerful reminder that politicians often use their ambition and ruthless drive for power productively. It might make you ""squeamish,"" Cranston tells the audience in the final scene of the play, but this is how new policies are born.  LBJ is as manipulative as any character in ""House of Cards,"" obsessing over power and willing to twist arms as far as they could go without breaking. But Schenkann captures something essential about LBJ and his allies on Capitol Hill: namely, that often power-craving politicians use that ambition toward higher ends.  The process is ugly, confusing, and messy. But in this case the product is something magnificent. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a ""big f-ing deal,"" in the words that our current vice president, Joe Biden, used to describe President Barack Obama's health care reform. When all was said and done, the Civil Rights Act ended the system of racial segregation that had defined public life in the South since the end of Reconstruction.  Politics is about compromise: In today's political environment, compromise is a dirty word. We don't value leaders who adjust their positions in the pursuit of cutting deals, dismissing them as flip-floppers and sellouts.  ""All the Way"" is about the necessity of compromise to keep things moving. Johnson, as well as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. agree to huge compromises that anger their supporters -- including civil rights leaders and Vice President Hubert Humphrey -- by, for example, agreeing to exclude voting rights from the legislation. At one point, Cranston's Johnson explains, ""This is not about principle. It's about votes!""   The costs of presidential hubris: Although the play focuses on the Civil Rights Act and election of 1964, the seeds of Johnson's destruction are planted in the early discussions of Vietnam surrounding the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in August 1964, when Johnson's political fears of a right-wing backlash (against a president who might be depicted as refusing to stand firm against communism) led him deeper into the mire of Vietnam. Even as Humphrey warns Johnson against getting deeply involved in the faraway conflict, Johnson, at the height of his influence, is confident that he will be able to contain it.  This is one of the lessons of presidential history that is too often forgotten. We see again and again, especially in the realm of foreign policy, how presidents from both parties can go too far, believing they know best and insisting they can avoid the mistakes of their predecessors. Their decisions ultimately damage their legacy and the nation.  Sometimes popular culture doesn't have much to offer for the real world. But ""All the Way"" is a great history lesson for voters and politicians who are concerned about the quality of America's civic life. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

U.S. must keep its promise on health care,"Health coverage is easy to get if you're healthy. The problem is when you're sick or have a history of illness. For decades, people with life-threatening chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease or stroke faced numerous barriers to getting the care they needed. Insurers could deny coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition, terminate coverage when the cost of a patient's care exceeded arbitrary dollar limits, or raise premiums to unaffordable levels in response to a diagnosis. As a result, patients had to skip or cut short their treatment because of costs, or go deeply into debt to pay for needed care. The patient protections enacted into law in 2010 are changing that, enabling more Americans to afford lifesaving care. These protections provide patients with the best chance to beat their illness. When fully implemented in 2014, they will require insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions, eliminate dollar limits on the coverage a patient can receive and ban the practice of inflating premiums for people with health concerns. The law makes these protections possible by requiring that most Americans buy health insurance. By ensuring that coverage extends both to healthy people, who are less expensive to insure, and to those who are sick, who cost more, the law helps to keep costs down for those who need care the most. Unfortunately, the ""individual responsibility"" requirement has been attacked as unconstitutional, posing a grave threat to the law's critical patient protections. Federal appeals courts are divided on the issue, and the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on the matter this week. Opinion: Health reform could survive loss of individual mandate Our organizations, which represent tens of millions of people across the country with life-threatening chronic diseases, together submitted a friend-of-the-court brief asserting that the individual responsibility provision is essential to preserving the protections that patients desperately need and deserve. We already know what a health care system without such a requirement looks like: Many healthy Americans opt not to buy health coverage until they are ill, and costs skyrocket as insurance pools fill with people in urgent need of treatment and care. People with pre-existing conditions are charged exorbitant rates for health coverage, putting critical care out of reach for many American families. As a result, many people with a chronic illness must resort to emergency room care, which lowers their chances of surviving their illness and drives up costs system-wide. Opinion: Why health care reform law is unconstitutional Many of those who want the individual responsibility requirement struck down also express support for the patient protections that the provision makes possible. Several states have tried such an approach by enacting insurance protections for patients with pre-existing conditions without compelling healthy people to enter the insurance market as well. These states are now among the most expensive in the country in which to buy insurance, and two of them, Kentucky and New Hampshire, ended up repealing those protections because of increasingly unaffordable premiums. Half of all non-elderly Americans are living with a pre-existing medical condition. They need the protection from discrimination by insurers that the Affordable Care Act provides. Our hope is that the Supreme Court will enable all Americans to benefit from the promise of access to guaranteed, affordable and adequate insurance. It is a promise our nation must keep.

"GOP, stop messing with Obamacare","The Republicans have taken control of Congress, and with it ownership of health care reform.  As long as the Republicans were in opposition, they could just complain. And they did, voting repeatedly — and futily — to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Now, they are coming up with actual reform ideas. Their first reform proposal — to redefine full-time employment as 40 hours a week under the ACA — may be emblematic of what is to come. The idea is favored by business groups that support the GOP financially.  But such a change would increase the number of uninsured and raise the federal budget deficit by $53 billion over the next 10 years.   Currently, full-time employment is defined as 30 hours per week, and under the health care law, large companies must offer health insurance to those working full time. Most American workers now work close to 40 hours a week and are insured. But under the Republican proposal, employers could send employees home a half-hour early on Friday and drop their coverage.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates this change could  ""lead employers to make changes that would affect many more workers than will be affected under current law"" as well as cause a million American workers to lose their employer-sponsored health insurance.   Nearly five years after its enactment, the ACA remains unpopular, despite the fact that many of its reforms — ending pre-existing condition exclusions, covering adult children to age 26, and closing the Medicare drug doughnut hole — are very popular.   The ACA has also been remarkably successful in achieving its goals.  Both the percentage of Americans who are uninsured and the rate of growth in health care spending are at historic lows.  Republicans continue to talk repeal, but actual repeal would at this point be disruptive. One of the great virtues of the ACA is that it has managed to extend coverage significantly without disrupting the three primary forms of coverage enjoyed by most Americans.  Nearly half of Americans are insured through their employment, while Medicare and Medicaid each cover another sixth. The ACA has expanded benefits for employed Americans by requiring coverage for preventive services and capping out-of-pocket expenditures. Employer-sponsored enrollment has remained largely stable under the ACA, while Medicare and Medicaid enrollment have grown.  Premiums for employer coverage and for Medicare have increased more slowly than in previous years.   Republican reform proposals, on the other hand, take aim squarely at the most widespread forms of coverage.  Conservatives have long called for an end to the tax exclusions that have helped to make employer coverage nearly universal in the United States.  They would not eliminate them entirely, rather replacing provisions that currently exempt employer-sponsored coverage from income and payroll taxes with capped deductions and exclusions.  For many employees this will result immediately in higher taxes or premiums.  Moreover, Congress is unlikely to adjust the fixed dollar subsidies to keep pace with health care inflation, so excess cost increases will simply be shifted — dollar for dollar — to employees.   Republicans also have long proposed shifting Medicare to a premium support program.  Seniors and the disabled would no longer be able to count on a guaranteed benefit, but would be given a fixed government contribution and have to shop for their own coverage.  Republicans propose turning Medicaid into a block grant program, shifting to the states responsibility for bearing the increasing costs of the program. One of the most problematic features of ACA coverage is the high deductibles and co-insurance that come with many marketplace plans for those whose incomes are too high to qualify them for cost-sharing reduction payments. But conservatives have supported high cost-sharing, and Republican proposals to repeal the ACA would wipe out the out-of-pocket expenditure caps it imposes.  Republicans support generous tax subsidies for health savings accounts to help cover cost sharing, but HSAs only benefit those wealthy enough to put savings aside, and particularly those in high tax brackets. Of course, any legislation that would undermine health coverage for Americans will have to survive a filibuster in the Senate and a veto from President Obama.  Republicans believe they now have a trump card: King v. Burwell, the case the Supreme Court will decide this summer.  Plaintiffs in King ask the court to read a few words of the ACA out of context to deprive millions of Americans of the help they are now receiving through the federal marketplaces.   Congress could easily clarify the meaning of these words through the kind of technical amendments that Congresses have always adopted after major legislation.  ACA opponents, however, are encouraging Congress to use a potential adverse Supreme Court decision to push through much broader changes. Notice that Republicans are not promising if you like the coverage you have now you can keep it, whether you are covered by employer-sponsored coverage, Medicare or Medicaid.

Health care reform's final day in court?,"The Supreme Court's new term began on Monday. It promises to be a significant one for health care reform. Lawsuits against the reform shepherded by President Obama, the Affordable Care Act, have been winding through the courts for some time now. Most have focused on the individual mandate, the part of the law that requires everyone to buy insurance. Some people believe that it is an overreach of government. If you can be forced to buy health insurance, then what can't you be forced to buy?  Others believe that health care is different, and that allowing this provision does not lead to a slippery slope. Still others believe that the individual mandate is simply a kind of tax, and completely fine. What most people wanted out of health care reform was the guarantee that they could always get health insurance, even if they were sick. Most people also felt that you shouldn't be penalized if you had a chronic condition that wasn't your fault. You should pay the same premiums as everyone else. Both of these provisions, known as guaranteed issue and community ratings, were very popular. There was a problem with those two things, though. They might keep some people, especially young, healthy people, from buying insurance. If you know you can always get health insurance even after you get sick, and you can't be charged any more for it, why not just wait until you need it? You can game the system. If only sick people buy insurance, then it gets very expensive, and won't work. This is called the ""free rider"" problem. One way to solve it is to make everyone buy insurance. And that's what the Affordable Care Act did. But it's not the individual mandate that's paramount; it's the idea that we need to strongly discourage healthy people from gaming the system. Congress could have done this in other ways. It could have raised everyone's taxes a bit and then provided a tax credit or refund for buying insurance. That's totally legal and done all the time -- think of the mortgage-interest deduction and child tax credit. But it was hard enough to pass the law without also raising everyone's taxes, and Congress chickened out of that route. There were still other options. Congress could have set an ""open enrollment"" period, say in January, as the only time you could get into the system. Since you couldn't buy insurance the rest of the year, people might be less likely to gamble on a free ride.  Congress could have imposed a penalty for trying to enter the system at a later date. Or it could have enacted a single-payer system, much as Vermont is doing. All of these things should be legal. They all already exist in some form in Medicare. And with a few exceptions, you don't see people running around calling Medicare unconstitutional. The real problem is not that we don't know how to fix the law, it's that many people don't want to. It's not as if the Obama administration isn't trying. Part of the recent ""President's Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction"" included language to strike the word ""penalty"" and replace it with ""tax,"" thus rendering all of the court challenges moot. But there's no way opponents of the Affordable Care Act will allow that. They want the whole thing gone, and challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate may provide them the tool to do just that. As the cases have worked their way up the courts, some justices have ruled in favor of the law and some against. Everyone knew, however, that this would eventually wind up at the Supreme Court. It's likely going to come down to one man -- Justice Anthony Kennedy -- providing the swing vote in a 5-4 decision to uphold or strike down the individual mandate.  Even if that part is struck down, the rest of the law may survive.  Precedent exists for allowing laws to survive after a piece is ruled unconstitutional. In fact, many think that striking down the mandate, while upholding the rest, might provide the perfect balance to justices who want to avoid being too controversial. A resolution is coming soon. The Obama administration has decided to take its case directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the 11th Circuit. This means that the case could be resolved as early as June, right as the presidential election campaign heads into full swing. People will disagree as to whether this is good or bad for the law, or good or bad for Democrats and Republicans, or good or bad for the candidates up for election. No one disagrees, however, that this will be a pivotal moment for the Supreme Court, for politics, and for the future of health care reform in the United States. Mark your calendars. It's going to be an exciting summer."
Bernie and Hillary: The toughest call,"Like a lot of New Yorkers, I haven't decided whether I'm voting for Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in next week's New York State primary.  Have you? I've always screwed up my face at the idea of ""undecided voters.""  Who are these mythical creatures who could possibly not have made up their minds about such a simple decision?   But here I am, more on the fence than ever, and deeply annoyed.   I was strongly leaning toward Sanders for much of the primary.  After all, I'm a populist progressive who loves grass-roots movements and aligns with the equitable ideals and achievements of democratic socialism.   And it was wonderful to finally be able to vote for a presidential candidate without holding my nose.  What a refreshing idea!  But Sanders has never been perfect.  His record of obstructing common sense gun control is disturbing.   And his rhetoric on racial justice — though certainly improved during the campaign — is clunky at best, shameful at worst.   What's more, Sanders is an economic determinist — the sort of progressive who sees all injustice through the lens of economic inequality and believes if you fix that, you fix everything else.  But this simply isn't true, nor is it possible to advance economic equality without addressing the gender, and especially racial, inequality on which economic injustice is built.   Even so, contrasted with a Democratic Party that has been self-defeatingly centrist on all of the above issues, Sanders has felt like a breath of fresh, left-wing air, one the nation seems desperately to need and which I have been eager to inhale.   But then there is Clinton. She is without a doubt one of the most qualified and thoughtful political leaders of her generation.  Her work on everything from health care reform to rights for women and girls worldwide is deeply admirable, as is her deep knowledge of every other issue on the domestic and global landscape.  Of course, I don't agree with many of her judgment calls — from her decision to support the war in Iraq, which reflects her overall  hawkishness,  to her coziness with Wall Street and historic support for pro-big business trade deals.   And she's better on racial justice than Sanders, but has yet to adequately account for her past support of legislation that led to decades of over-incarceration of black people she once labeled ""superpredators.""   But I agree with Hillary Clinton on the issues far more than I disagree with her.  And I suspect she would make one of the most effective, efficient presidents in American history.  (Then again, I worry she would be equally effective and efficient on the 10% or so of issues on which we don't agree.) My 7-year-old daughter very much wants me to support Clinton.  So much so that she's asked if she can go with me to vote and ""press the button"" for Hillary (she can't; it's illegal, and the vote is mine).  So instead she's been making pro-Hillary signs and argues for Clinton like she's being fed talking points from the campaign.   She wants a woman to be president.  It's unfair that there hasn't been one yet, she says.  And she's right.   But do I want this woman to be president?  And here I'm reminded of the higher standards applied to women in the public eye, the extra hoops women must jump through, the subtle ways they face extra scrutiny.  How much of my reluctance to throw in with Clinton is replicating that sexism?  After all, I had almost all the same concerns about Barack Obama in 2008, but I enthusiastically supported his campaign. So here it is — my list of pros and cons as I weigh how to cast my own, individual vote.  I'll be watching the CNN Democratic Debate in my home borough of Brooklyn on Thursday, April 14, at 9 p.m. on CNN to see how the candidates address these issues — and hopefully to make up my mind.

How Republicans can cure Obamacare,"The debate over health care reform once again blooms in D.C., but this time Democrats and the President whose legacy rests on the Affordable Care Act are tending a garden challenged by some rather invasive species.       The GOP has kicked off its season by pulling Obamacare up by the roots in its proposed 2016 House budget. But this budget will not become law.  And so Republicans are also preparing strategic plays if the Supreme Court rules in their favor this summer, or if a Republican wins the White House next year backed by complementary majorities in the House and Senate.  Either scenario would mortally wound Obamacare. But this isn't a zero sum game. Smart Republicans already know they don't win just because the other side loses.  Upending Obamacare may poison the GOP's standing with 16.4 million Americans who will face adverse, even dire consequences without legislative patches to the law, or a swift switch to a solid alternative health care policy.  This week, the conservative weekly The Washington Examiner aimed to mark Obamacare's fifth anniversary by asking a panel whether to ""reform, replace or restart"" the law. A gas leak scuttled the event.  Once they've regrouped for their next panel, Republicans should instead entertain a different R: Revise. So far every plan Republicans are offering strikes out any mandate to purchase insurance, which, oddly for a party celebrating self-reliance, encourages some people to continue shifting their adult responsibilities onto others. Many of the GOP plans replace the subsidies that make exchange plans affordable for low-income Americans with tax credits. Tax credits don't make much sense when you don't have a lot of taxes to pay in the first place.  These alternatives appear to be thinly veiled transitions away from the key Obamacare principle of providing guaranteed access. To date the law has reduced the rates of uninsured Americans by a whopping 35%.  Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, lifted his veil even during his own plan's debut by insisting ""every last word of Obamacare must be repealed"" while promoting his own Health Care Choices Act that ditches subsidies and the mandate.  Republican presidential front-runner Jeb Bush shares Cruz's preference to dismantle the ""monstrosity"" altogether, describing his preference for cheaper catastrophic insurance that helps people with massive bills but leaves poor Americans to fend for themselves when it comes to needless perks -- like insulin and blood pressure pills.  And besides repealing the ACA, House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Georgia, wants to tear into President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society achievements as well.  His budget proposal dismantles the federal Medicaid program by slashing its funding and devolving it to the states, while asking seniors on Medicare to try their luck with a voucher-discounted private insurance.  What these approaches don't get is that we live in a country entirely populated by citizens who want and expect to receive medical care when they need it, yet not all of these citizens want to pay anything for the privilege. The beating heart of Obamacare is its mandate to purchase health insurance, which keeps costs down for everyone, makes it fiscally feasible to cover patients with pre-existing conditions, and makes government subsidies possible for those who can't afford any insurance without them.  If Republicans shift their focus to revising Obamacare, there are an array of spots to trim and weeds to pull, and they can expect many Democrats to join in the work. But after dealing with a withering onslaught of over 60 Republican attempts to kill the bill, Democrats can't make even the most basic fixes for fear of losing everything.  But there are some places to look. Even ACA supporters can acknowledge some specific anti-competitive features in the law.  This should interest Republicans. The ACA's push toward offloading risk onto hospitals rather than insurers is encouraging hospital consolidation, with large hospital corporations seeking to build economies of scale to offset future risk  This trend may drive up costs as hospitals face less competition. Meanwhile consumers shopping the exchange plans can select from few in-network hospitals and physicians, again making the health care marketplace less competitive.  The United States may be graced with institutions offering stellar care in complex conditions that attract patients across state lines as well as across the world, centers that contribute to medicine generally through their research and training. But going out of state to seek such care isn't an option for many patients on exchange plans.  Cruz proposes opening up health insurance markets nationally, an idea that we should build on.  Years of a rough economy have left many consumers without the income or savings to pay the high copays, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums that Obamacare uses as a cost-control measure. Among families making 250% to 400% over the federal poverty line, 55% to 68% can't make their deductible, depending on their plan.  The numbers are considerably worse for families under that threshold, and even for families making over 400% of the poverty line, 25% to 38% can't pay the out of pocket maximum if they become seriously ill. Despite these costs, the ACA penalizes responsible consumers further by capping flexible spending accounts.  Furthermore, Obamacare is in part more expensive than it might be because it takes a gamble covering preventive testing for people with no sign of disease for ""free,"" yet makes patients with chronic conditions pay deductibles even when we know their care will save money in the long run.  That's not the most rational distribution of funds if we're trying to do the greatest good for the greatest number at the lowest cost. Since Jeb Bush is interested in focusing on the big-ticket items and not sweating the small stuff, perhaps this is an area where he can throw his support.  Obamacare isn't a work of art by any means. It's a messy, pragmatic attempt to reach a goal the majority of Americans want: access to affordable health care when it's needed. Some rather fundamental revisions lie ahead, like a forthcoming administrative decision on whether to continue allowing state variability among the prescribed Essential Health Benefits it covers.  So, my advice to Republicans is that they pick one or two specific aspects of Obamacare they'd like to improve, let's have the policy debate, then introduce your legislative fix to the existing law, leaving its beating heart intact.  Show you're open to constructively improving the ACA and I'm sure we'll see Democrats start coming to the table with their own pet peeves about the law. 2016 doesn't have to be a hyperbolic, hyperventilating contest for the fate of 16.4 million Americans.  ​Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.

"For health reform, now the tricky part","White House officials rightly breathed a sigh of relief when the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act. President Obama and his supporters are optimistic that his re-election prospects are stronger and his lasting impact on domestic policy will be much greater. But the battle has only begun. Even after legislation is enacted, as the political scientist Eric Patashnik says in his book ""Reforms at Risk,"" its survival is not assured.  The key to success is whether a program lasts over time and builds strong political support to protect it from future attacks. As Patashnik and political scientist Jeffrey Jenkins wrote in a recent blog post, before the Supreme Court ruled: ""The partisan and ideological struggle over health-care reform is likely to continue under any scenario."" Opinion: Health care victory, but still a long way to go Congressional Republicans will likely continue attacking the program's funding. House Speaker John Boehner has vowed to push for its repeal. Mitt Romney has said he will do the same if he is elected president. Congressional Republicans will use the budgetary axe to make sure that ACA does not have a smooth path to success.  The Supreme Court's decision on Medicaid has opened up questions about whether red state governors will follow through with an essential expansion of the program. There are also challenges in making the law work. Who will enforce penalties on those who refuse to buy insurance? How effective will the cost controls be?  States setting up their health care exchanges will need to take tremendous care so that consumers really receive the best choices about where to purchase their insurance. Some state officials, in Idaho and South Dakota for example, are refusing to implement the law until after November. Will the federal government step in to set up these states' health care exchanges?   The good news for Obama is that many sturdy, well-regarded federal programs did not start out that way. Social Security did not do well at first. A freeze on taxes during World War II jeopardized the program, and there were real concerns that it would not survive, given that other programs for the elderly were more popular.  But Congress made adjustments, expanding coverage to include groups such as widows, increasing benefits and revising the tax system to a pay-as-you-go basis, with monthly benefits funded by monthly taxes. By 1950, the program was sound and received bipartisan support. Opinion: Health care ruling will help Romney When the Supreme Court struck down an agricultural-processing tax that supported a farm subsidy program in 1936, Congress reworked it, resolving the constitutional problems and protecting farmers. Other periods have seen similar adjustments. Congress passed a watered-down voting rights bill in 1957, one that frustrated liberals. Lyndon Johnson, then the Senate majority leader, promised it would be improved upon and expanded in future years.  ""It's just a beginning,"" he told liberals. ""We've shown that we can do it, we'll do it again."" He was right. In 1964 and 1965, Congress passed far bolder legislation. Medicare, which Congress enacted in 1965, has faced the chronic challenge of cost control. In the 1980s, Congress imposed regulations on what hospitals could charge the program to help contain rising costs. Congress has taken similar action with taxes. When President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cut and increased military spending made the  deficit balloon, Congress  -- with the support of key Republicans like Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas -- raised  taxes in 1982 and 1983. Congress' job is not just to make new laws, but also to fix existing ones. The question now is whether Congress can overcome polarization and gridlock to refine and improve the health care law  to make sure it works. In many respects, the 2012 election will be a much bigger moment for health care than the Court decision. If Democrats don't make sure this law works well, a future Congress might use its power to repeal the legislation and finish the job they wish the Supreme Court had done.

GOP health care plan is a ruse,"It's your health care or your iPhone.  Republicans say it's high time Americans have some skin in the health care game. Never mind all the voters who've confronted their representatives for weeks now about the stark, life-or-death choices they endured before Obamacare: lost jobs, lost homes, bankruptcies.  The newly introduced American Health Care Act is infused with a spirit of, well, this:  ""Americans have choices. They've gotta make a choice. Maybe rather than getting that new iPhone they just love and they want to go spend hundreds of dollars on that, maybe they should invest it in their own health care. They've gotta make decisions themselves,"" Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, told Alisyn Camerota on CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday.  Let them eat cake indeed.  This is the grand health care reform that President Donald Trump described to the nation just last week in a series of platitudes before a joint session of Congress. Is it grand?  Let's put it this way: Plenty of Americans might need those iPhones when their only ""coverage"" is a quick consult of WebMD online.  The White House initially stepped cautiously around this specific GOP legislation, with spokesman Sean Spicer saying in a statement Monday that the bill was an ""important step"" and that ""President Trump looks forward to working with both chambers of Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare.""  But the spin doctoring couldn't last:  ""Our wonderful new Healthcare Bill is now out for review and negotiation,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning, taking ownership of the bill. ""ObamaCare is a complete and total disaster - is imploding fast!"" So let's take a look at the newly released American Health Care Act and see how it stacks up against the five principles the President outlined to Congress and the nation last week.    1.       Trump to Congress: ""First, we should ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.""    The Republican plan: First, Trump's promise that pre-existing conditions will be covered crashes on the rocks of an unsustainable insurance market. Trumpcare would disincentivize personal responsibility by revoking Obamacare's requirement that adults maintain coverage (the ""mandate"") and allowing folks who become sick to hop back into the insurance market at any time.  So, under this new plan, expect insurance rolls well-stocked with sick patients who are actively using resources, while healthy people, especially the young, have to choose threadbare plans or nothing at all.  Trumpcare does force the sick who have let their insurance lapse, but suddenly need it, to pay a 30% surcharge, but that's still quite a bargain if you really need the chemotherapy. And what if you can't afford the higher rates? That's where the high-risk pools come in.  These are federally supported, state-regulated, subsidized health insurance plans, and the Trumpcare bill extends them a lifeline of $100 billion to be shared among all the states over the course of 10 years.  Under this scenario, don't be so confident that you, with your pre-existing condition, will be able to get health insurance rapidly.  You have no guarantee the high-risk pool insurance will be there when you need it: The wells regularly ran dry the last time states tried this type of insurance, and we should expect that will happen again.  2.       Trump to Congress: ""Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts --- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government.""   The Republican plan: Here we have truth in advertising, the bill contains both tax credits and HSAs, but it allows for weaker plans, removing Obamacare's platinum, gold, silver and bronze tiers. Instead, the bill allows for more watered down plans that have lower ""actuarial values"" than even the bronze tier plan, where insurance covers only 60% and you cover the rest.  An earlier version of the bill eliminated Obamacare's essential health benefits as well -- that's the range of services, from pregnancy to rehabilitation, that all plans must cover -- allowing the states to make those decisions. But now the GOP bill, as introduced, allows those required categories of coverage to stand. This is much to the consternation of the Freedom Caucus and other Republicans, who are more conservative on this issue and want to see a fully unfettered insurance market.  Because there are multiple stages of health care reform the President intends to facilitate, those Republicans, who are essential to passing a true Obamacare replacement, will have plenty of opportunity to eliminate the comprehensive coverage requirement.  As for the tax credits, they're capped at a much lower level than Obamacare, ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 depending on your age (and phased out for individuals making over $75,000 or couples making over $150,000). This means you'll need the money in your HSA more than ever  -- for those little incidentals, like covering the rest of your premium or the increased out-of-pocket costs your Trumpcare plan doesn't pick up.   It's a bright spot that the bill maintains Obamacare's annual out-of-pocket limits ($7,150 for an individual, $14,300 for a family in 2017), but you should expect to spend that kind of money much more often under Trumpcare.    3.       Trump to Congress:  ""Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out."" The Republican plan:  Trumpcare would rout Medicaid, leaving one of the signal achievements of President Lyndon Johnson's vision of a Great Society in tatters.  Under this GOP plan, beginning in 2020 the federal government will start dialing down its commitment to the poor and disabled, capping its Medicaid support per enrollee initially at the spending levels in 2016, and using a formula for annual increases rather than actually providing for the real costs of Medicaid services.  The legislation removes requirements that Medicaid plans provide coverage of essential health benefits. Trumpcare would mean less care for disabled people who need Medicaid services to be able to live in the community, people who need mental health and addiction services, and anyone reading this article who might one day find themselves out of a job, unable to afford any private insurance, and needing Medicaid's help.    4.       Trump to Congress: ""Fourthly, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance -- and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs and bring them down immediately.""   The Republican plan: While I've found nothing about malpractice reform in the American Health Care Act introduced this week, the ""Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017,"" sponsored by Steve King, R-Iowa, made it out of committee last week, and seeks to cap damages for pain and suffering in lawsuits to $250,000.   King's bill specifically targets federally sponsored insurance programs, including employer-based health plans, because they benefit from tax credits. The rationale here is that limiting health care system liability will keep costs lower.  Many have argued that some element of tort reform should have been included in Obamacare, but any new liability system should account for the fact that pain and suffering do occur due to medical errors. Error is baked into any medical system. I think we should predict an error rate, tax medical services for it, set aside those funds, and allocate them as needed.  There are more rational ways to handle this than the way we do now, but King's bill leaves a lot to be desired. His bill does necessitate open and deep debate, but such a conversation is unlikely in this political environment.  The GOP's plan also doesn't address drug prices, but Trump tells us he is still on the case, tweeting today, ""I am working on a new system where there will be competition in the Drug Industry. Pricing for the American people will come way down!"" Pharma stocks promptly plummeted.     5.       Trump to Congress: ""Finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines -- creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.""   The Republican plan:  The GOP's American Health Care Act doesn't do anything to allow folks in Massachusetts to buy a plan sold out of, say, Texas. There's none of the much ballyhooed national insurance market Trump has touted since the campaign trail, but Trump insisted this morning on Twitter that eliminating state lines is coming in ""phase 2 & 3 of the healthcare rollout.""  That's too bad, since it doesn't make any sense. Insurance companies have to negotiate rates with individual providers and hospitals, a big enough job in any single state, so buying cheap Texas insurance isn't going to be of much help if all your local hospitals in Massachusetts are out of network. ---------- Bottom line? At least when you buy an iPhone you know exactly what you're getting. So far, Trumpcare is largely a bait and switch, both for the President's supporters and the rest of America; that's the majority that chose someone else to do the job Trump ended up winning.  In that dreamy speech to Congress, the President didn't just paint a portrait of legislation we've yet to see. He also highlighted the case of one particular rare disease survivor, a woman who's now alive and a student at Notre Dame because her father founded a biomedical research company that successfully developed an enzyme treatment for her Pompe disease.  Like many survivors of severe diseases and injuries, she lives with significant physical disabilities she must manage. The President used her case to argue for fewer FDA restrictions on innovators like her father.  No question, America must continue to promote a business environment that encourages medical research and development. But the pressing problem for anyone living with a serious disability is getting the medical services, equipment and independent living support they need now. No amount of entrepreneurship can provide the human-to-human services any cheaper.  These are simply the fixed costs of operating any decent society, the kind that values even people whose parents didn't found companies on their behalf.   To misunderstand that basic principle is as clueless as comparing your buying an iPhone with buying the false promises the American Health Care Act of 2017 is selling."
"In Trump's White House, it's everyone for himself","Sebastian Gorka -- among the most loyal of Trump's staff to his Make America Great Again agenda -- is out.  At this point, it's astonishing that anyone is still working at the White House. In a few more months, the President may even have to do his own cooking. Donald Trump has lost, among others, his chief strategist, his chief of staff and three directors of communications. Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, has chosen to publicly air his grievances towards Trump's Charlottesville comments, in which the President equated neo-Nazi marchers with those who protested them -- and yet stay in his job rather than resign.  It's an extraordinary test of the President's patience and authority. So what is going on? Cohn's gambit is an insight into how the Trump White House works. As Politico implies, Trump governs with a kind of creative anarchy: He apparently likes to taunt people, play them off each other and keep them guessing. Attorney General Jeff Sessions offered his resignation over the Russia affair and Trump criticized him openly, yet he ultimately kept his job. Steve Bannon gave every impression of being certain he was not going anywhere -- only to resign or be pushed out, depending on whom you believe. This makes Cohn's tactic of signaling discontent without walking away more logical. Some say he's just hanging on to get the job of chairman of the Federal Reserve.  Maybe.  But let's imagine, because it's not hard, that this intelligent, Jewish member of the White House is genuinely angry at the President's response to the Charlottesville march, that he realizes how complex it can be to resign, doesn't want to abandon ship anyway because he honestly believes he can help right it, and so chooses to make his point -- but stay.  ""I feel a duty to fulfill my commitment to work on behalf of the American people,"" Cohn told the Financial Times. If so, it's an honorable decision. But it still leaves his position fundamentally untenable. Trump has chosen to take a stand on the culture war. Right now, many conservatives are embarrassed by the President's reaction to Charlottesville and want to protect their reputations. In the long run, they might come to thank him for what he did: The activist Left is never going to regard the Republicans as anything other than racist, and someone had to oppose the strange fever of statue demolition sweeping the nation.  Moreover, there's no escaping the way that Trump's latest fight with the media excites and rallies his base -- the one that put him where he is and that the GOP needs if it's going to keep its majority in next year's congressional elections. In other words, love him or loathe him, Trump is the captain of the Republican ship. Republicans like Cohn either have to accept his leadership or disembark. But that's Cohn's personal crisis to work through.  Trump's problem is that the battle with the media is only a distraction from the growing gulf between what he campaigned on and what he's actually achieving in office. Sebastian Gorka has made this point forcefully. In a resignation letter published by The Federalist website, Gorka said that those on the White House staff who are committed to the President's Make America Great Again agenda have been isolated.  So, while men like Cohn imply that the administration has gone too far to the right, Trumpites like Gorka complain that it has gone too far to the left. The big picture of his administration is far from the disaster often suggested: Trump has signed 53 bills into law and the economy is strong. When faced with a crisis, the President has shown decisive leadership. North Korea has, for the moment, been mostly put back in its box, though Pyongyang continues to test missiles; Trump upheld the red line on the use of the chemical weapons in Syria. But key legislative goals such as health care reform and building the border wall remain unaccomplished, partly because of opposition from moderate Republicans. And the pledge to make America great again is undermined by the impression of chaos in the Oval Office. Not only is Trump failing to manage his foot soldiers effectively, but he's also failing to provide clear philosophical direction that commands the loyalty of his staff. It's every man for himself in the Trump White House, starting with the President."
Independent voters are rejecting Romney,"Mitt Romney is learning that there are costs to an ugly, extended primary fight marked by a rush to the far right. Independent voters get alienated by the extremism. Last weekend, Romney was trying to reassure attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference he was ""severely conservative,"" but that elevation of ideological inflexibility sounds like someone who's hitting the Kool-Aid a little too hard for most independent voters. This is a problem with polarization -- and it's already showing signs of benefiting President Barack Obama. After trailing Romney for months among independent voters in a hypothetical matchup, the president is back on top -- 51% to 42% in a new Pew Research Center Poll. Just four months ago, the numbers were almost reversed, totaling a 19% swing since the primaries began in earnest. This isn't subtle -- it's something close to an outright revolt of the independents in response to the spectacle they've seen in the Republican contests since Iowa -- avalanches of negative ads and an outright pander-fest to various forces on the far right. A new CNN/ORC International poll finds that 53% of independents have an unfavorable view of Romney, compared with 44% last month.  It has potentially huge implications extending into the fall. Remember that independents are the largest and fastest-growing segment of the electorate -- reaching an unprecedented 40% in the most recent Gallup Poll.   Independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans and how they swing will determine the winner of the next election. In the past, Romney's trump card was his alleged electability. Armed with his experience getting elected as a Republican in Massachusetts, the argument was that he had a proven ability to appeal to centrists and swing voters. In contrast, the president had a demonstrated vulnerability with independents, after winning them by 8 percentage points in 2008.  As I've written here before, independents started breaking with Obama early in his administration after the stimulus bill passed along partisan lines. The disaffection deepened after health care reform took center stage. This had long been a Democratic priority, but it had not been a centerpiece of the campaign, and independent voters were focused first on the economy.  Taken together, the growth in government spending, the increase in deficits and the growing polarization in Washington turned independents off.  This was not the hope and change for which they had voted. The result was that independents swung to Republicans by a 17-point margin in the midterm 2010 landslide. But Republicans' ideological overreach since taking control of Congress has inspired a backlash among independents that Obama is now benefiting from. Even with Congress having an all-time low 11% approval rating according to CNN polls, congressional Republicans are the least popular species in the Washington swamp among independents. As a result, independent voters are open to giving Obama another look, especially when presented with the prospect of conservatives having unified control of government. But the problem is most pronounced with Romney. Romney's poll numbers have been in free fall with independents since scrutiny of the primaries began in earnest.  The number of independents who say Romney is ""honest and trustworthy"" has declined from 53% to 41% since November. The avalanche of negative advertising deployed with devastating effectiveness by the Romney campaign and it supportive super PAC in Iowa and Florida has taken a toll. Likewise, only 32% of independents say Romney takes consistent positions on issues. And perhaps most devastatingly, only 31% of independents say Romney ""understands the needs of people like you"" -- 60% disagree. This spells special trouble for the GOP if the key battleground demographic of the election is middle-class voters. Among the rationalizations offered by Republican political consultants is that the Democrats had a protracted primary fight four years ago, and it left candidate Obama stronger to fight and win the general election. But there is one big difference. The 2008 Democratic contest between Obama and Hillary Clinton was focused on which candidate could better connect with centrist Democrats, especially white working-class voters who often are the decisive swing voters in a general election. As a result of that extended effort, it's no wonder that the Democratic nominee was in a better position to compete for those votes in the fall. The problem is that the Republican contest is focused in the opposite direction -- seeing which candidate can best connect with the conservative base. Centrist Republicans and swing voters are not part of the conversation in the GOP primaries -- in fact, they are being actively campaigned against instead of courted. The greatest insult that can be hurled in this far-right field is that a candidate ever worked with Democrats in the past. The word ""moderate"" itself has become an insult. This is what happens when a political party burns down the big tent. The problem of ideological polarization, combined with an extended primary, results in candidates who have a hard time connecting with the rest of the electorate when the nomination is done. At a time when many independents are sick of the hyper-partisan gridlock in Washington -- the childish inability of too many in Congress to reason together and solve problems in the national interest -- the current fight for the far right only seems to guarantee more of the same. To be clear, Obama is benefiting by comparison to the Republican field. His budget essentially ignores the kind of long-term deficit reduction that motivates many independent voters. So there is no reason for overconfidence on the part of his Chicago-based campaign. But the fight for the right that is now the focus of these primaries is souring independents on the GOP.  And the relentlessly negative ads from the Romney camp are having a particularly pronounced impact on his ability to connect with the crucial independent vote, even if he were to slog through this mud fight to win the nomination.

6 reasons Obama can't seem to catch a break,"The White House received bad news and good news last week. New polling data indicated that President Barack Obama might be more unpopular than ever before. According to a survey by The Washington Post and ABC News, the President's approval rating has fallen to 41%, down from an already meager 46% earlier in 2014.  No matter what Obama does these days, he can't seem to catch a break. Even with a flurry of good news about the booming enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act and solid evidence that the economy is finally in a period of recovery, with Friday's employment report showing robust job growth in March and a lower than expected unemployment rate -- and even though American troops are largely out of any major military conflict -- a large portion of the public still doesn't seem to like this President.  Why can't he gain more traction with the electorate? There are six factors: 1. Second-term blues: Part of the problem has nothing to do with Obama but rather the ongoing challenge that second-term presidents face. The fact is that winning re-election does not often produce great feelings among voters. After the initial bounce from the re-election victory, most second-term presidents find themselves in trouble with the electorate and Congress. As is usually the case, the opposition party has a stronger foothold in Congress by this time. By the middle of a second term, the public grows tired of a president, and his record provides more fodder for American voters to be unhappy about. Over the course of a presidency, our nation's leader inevitably makes big compromises, as Obama has done with the National Security Agency and deportation, that anger the base of his party. According to Gallup Poll, the only postwar presidents who had approval ratings that were better in their second term than their first were Reagan and Clinton. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower and George W. Bush saw their ratings slip. And Reagan, whose ratings finally boomed as a result of the historic diplomatic breakthrough with the Soviet Union in 1987, had actually struggled through most of his second term (with his ratings falling under 50%) as many of his domestic policies were unpopular and the Iran-Contra investigation dragged down his reputation. David Gergen: Obama a lame duck for 33 months? 2. Polarized electorate: The challenge that Obama faces is also a product of our deeply polarized electorate. With more voters having settled in the Republican or Democratic camp, winning long-term support from a majority of the country is harder to achieve. Elections have been extremely close in recent decades, with one candidate winning based on a small handful of swing states. There are no more 1936 or 1964 or 1984 elections, where the winning candidate wins by a massive landslide. Instead, presidents are re-elected by narrower margins with huge swaths of the electorate entrenched in their opposition to the incumbent. That opposition only grows fiercer as the second term unfolds and the excitement of the election fades. 3. The conservative media complex: Conservatives have been enormously successful in building a sophisticated network of media institutions since the 1970s. During the time of the conservative revolution in American politics, the right paid close attention to building an infrastructure on radio, television and the Internet through which to promote their ideas and counteract, what they saw, as a liberal bias in the mainstream media. The result has been that even though Obama retained control of the White House, conservatives have their own bully pulpit through which to communicate their opposition and analyze news in a way that is unfavorable to Democrats. The President confronts a constant barrage of unfavorable news, literally, regardless of what he does or does not do. 4. Policy success brings controversy: Obama is also a victim of his own success. The fact is that during his first year the President was able to get a lot done. When Democrats controlled Congress, the administration was able to enact sweeping legislation -- a national health care program, an economic stimulus bill and financial regulation. Success in politics often creates more enemies. The bolder the innovation the fiercer the opposition can become, as more Americans become unhappy or threatened by the change. President Lyndon Johnson, now receiving praise on the 50th anniversary of his civil rights bill, paid the price  for his Great Society, starting with the midterm elections of 1966 as more of the electorate threw their support to Republicans and conservative Democrats who said that Johnson was spending too much and that his social programs were causing chaos in the cities. 5. The new normal in the economy: The nature of the economy makes it difficult for Obama to gain traction even when economic indicators are moving in the right direction. The structural problems facing the modern economy, with many middle-class jobs having gone to other countries or disappeared altogether, mean that economic recovery often revolves around low-pay and insecure work that doesn't leave Americans feeling better. Economic recovery is not what it used to be. The U.S. economy, according to the latest gross domestic product report, grew at a meager .1% annual rate between January and March. Beneath the good economic news there are problems. A sizable number of Americans, for instance, have dropped out of the workforce. Many of the jobs that have been popping up are not very good. Even with Friday's positive jobs report, the sluggish recovery and the new normal with high rates of underemployment mean many Americans are not celebrating Obama as they did in the late 1990s when Clinton was able to enjoy the rewards of booming economic growth. The Washington Post-ABC poll found that a mere 28% felt the economy was improving. 6. Poor messaging: One of the main areas of criticism that Obama has faced comes from his unwillingness to promote and sell his policies in face of a mobilized and determined opposition. Very often, when opponents have called his programs off center and deemed them a failure, Obama has not done much to respond. When Republicans called his market-based health care reform ""socialized medicine,"" the President did not do much to respond and develop a different narrative. When Republicans charge that the economic stimulus was a total failure, Obama didn't come back with a systematic response to show that this was not the case.  The result was that many voters who might otherwise be more sympathetic to the President's accomplishments have bought into the picture that was painted by the GOP.  Even many Americans who remain in Obama's camp are less enthused about his leadership after listening to the barrage of criticism about his decisions. Other factors are at work as well. There are some Americans who unfortunately are not comfortable with an African-American President. Others feel he has not performed well in the realm of foreign policy, seeing Russia's aggressive moves as evidence that the United States does not have a sound road map for dealing with threats overseas. Conditions won't likely improve for the administration. Although some kind of breakthrough might help the President improve his numbers -- as Reagan enjoyed when the Iran-Contra scandal was replaced by the diplomatic breakthrough with the Soviet Union over an arms agreement -- probably the next few years won't give Obama much of a boost in the polls. In the short term, Democrats will pay the cost for this in the midterm elections, giving Republicans even more of a base of power to fuel the flames of discontent with the White House.

Health reform could survive loss of individual mandate,"On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on the individual mandate. This component of the Affordable Care Act, the part that decrees that every American will either buy health insurance or face a financial penalty, is the most controversial part of health care reform. How did we wind up at this place? Why would the Democrats have included something so unpopular in health care reform?  You have to remember what health care reform was all about. Private insurance companies can make more money when they cover healthy people and don't cover the sick. That's not a moral judgment; it's simple economics. When insurance subscribers get sick, private insurance companies pay out money. Therefore, if executives of a private insurance company know someone is sick, they  won't want to cover him or her. If they decide to do so, they are certainly going to charge that sick person more -- if they can. What that means is that if you have a chronic illness, or you develop one, you're could be uninsurable. Or, if you try to find coverage on your own (not through an employer), you're going to have a hard time affording whatever insurance you can buy. The problem is that more than 130 million Americans have a chronic illness such as diabetes, arthritis or heart disease. People with chronic illnesses are significantly more likely to be uninsured and to use public programs. That costs society a lot of money, and it makes the overall health of Americans worse. One way to avoid this is to make it so that insurance companies must insure everyone. That's known as guaranteed issue. It means that an insurance company can't refuse to cover you. But if you do that, then the insurance company might charge sick people so much money that they still can't afford the insurance. This is known as experience rating. The way to avoid that is by requiring community ratings. That's where an insurance company can only vary the cost of insurance by a few factors, usually not directly based on your prior health experience. These often include things such as your age, whether you smoke and where you live. Under this type of plan, insurance will likely cost more for people who are otherwise young and healthy, but less overall, perhaps, for everyone. The larger your risk pool is, the cheaper insurance usually is overall. So you have your guaranteed issue and your community rating. Or, to put it more plainly, you are assured that you can buy insurance, even if you have a pre-existing condition, and the insurance companies can't charge you more for it. Everyone is happy. There's a problem though. Under these regulations, healthy people get a bit of a shaft. Their insurance is more expensive than it otherwise might have been. They might not want to buy it. Moreover, why should they buy it? After all, they don't need it while they are healthy. This is especially true, because we just made it so that if they someday get sick, they are assured they can get insurance, and they won't be penalized for being sick with higher rates. This is called ""gaming the system."" It leads to what is also known as ""adverse selection."" Healthy people preferentially opt out of the system. This means that those who buy insurance are somewhat sicker than the general population. This means the risk pool of covered people is more expensive, which means that insurance rates go up for everyone. This leads to more healthy people opting out. This makes it even more expensive, and soon you have a ""death spiral"" where the whole system breaks down and the private insurance market collapses. How can you avoid this? By mandating that everyone, even healthy people buy insurance. If everyone, even nonsick people, buys insurance, then the system is stable. The risk pool is healthier, and it's all OK. Financial incentives are often how the government gets us to do things. So the  Affordable Care Act stipulated that people would have to pay a fine if they don't buy insurance.  There are any number of people, however, who believe that this is a new and unprecedented reach of government, forcing us to buy a private product. That is what the Supreme Court will hear arguments on this week. Read a transcript of the Supreme Court arguments The truth is, though, that none of this matters from a policy perspective. It doesn't matter that the individual mandate was thought up by a conservative think tank that now opposes it. It doesn't matter that the arguments against the mandate would also likely invalidate privatizing Social Security in the future. It doesn't matter because the mandate isn't really necessary. We don't need the mandate. What we need is something that helps us avoid adverse selection and the death spiral. That could have been accomplished with a tax credit. Instead of penalizing those who don't buy insurance, the government could have raised everyone's taxes a bit and then returned a credit to those who bought insurance. This is totally constitutional and isn't much different than the tax deduction many of us already enjoy by purchasing insurance. The government could also set a waiting period for those who choose to opt out of the system. If they can't get in until a number of years later, many people won't want to take the chance they might get sick in the interim. They would be more likely to buy insurance. The government could charge a penalty for those who choose to wait before buying insurance. This is how Medicare Part D works. It also incentivizes people to buy in right away, and it's also perfectly legal. Why weren't these plans enacted instead? Well, for one reason, the mandate works better than penalties or waiting periods. The other reason is political. It was hard enough to pass the law without attaching a ""tax."" So Congress went another way, and now it potentially pays the price. I say this doesn't matter, because it's fixable if people truly cared about the mandate, and the mandate only. We can have the desired effect of the mandate without the offensive, potentially unconstitutional, aspects of it. But at this point, many fighting the mandate are really fighting the Affordable Care Act, albeit with the tools available to them. So we will watch. We will see if the Supreme Court strikes down the mandate, and if the justices do, we will see if they strike down the rest of the law with it.  If the law stands, then we can still fix it. If, that is, the fight over the mandate isn't really a proxy for a fight over the  Affordable Care Act. The latter really can exist without the former, if people so desire.

Why the GOP is stuck in neutral,"It wasn't pretty, but the Republicans won a much-needed victory Thursday in a raucous special election for Montana's sole seat in the House of Representatives. The winner, Greg Gianforte, faces misdemeanor assault charges for allegedly choking and body-slamming a reporter the night before the election. He joins a Republican House majority with problems even more serious than the prospect of a member who could end up in jail. The GOP faces a looming fight over raising the debt ceiling; a still-unresolved effort to repeal Obamacare; and an attempt to reform the tax system before Christmas. All three efforts are in danger of delay or defeat. It wasn't supposed to be this way. It  seems like a distant memory now, but it was only about six months ago that Republican leaders were giddily proclaiming a new political era. ""Welcome to the dawn of a new unified Republican government,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan crowed, a week after Donald Trump's surprise victory and the party's no-less-surprising ability to hang onto a thin Senate majority. ""This will be a government focused on turning President-elect Trump's victory into real progress for the American people,"" Ryan promised. What a difference half a year makes. Ethical stumbles, rookie errors and sheer political arrogance have left the Republican agenda -- and the GOP legislative majority itself -- in grave peril.  The problems began with the confused, disastrously rushed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  After bitterly divided House Republicans barely managed to get a repeal bill passed -- a bill that has still not been transmitted to the Senate for further action -- the Congressional Budget Office estimated the measure would result in 23 million Americans being uninsured by 2026. That virtually guarantees the Senate will kill or substantially rework the legislation, leaving the Republicans' No. 1 promise -- shouted daily on the campaign trail by Trump and virtually every Republican lawmaker -- unfulfilled.   The second main agenda item, tax reform, also looks shaky: Congressional leaders have already fallen behind the aggressive schedule needed to produce a bill by August. There's no secret about the reason for the rocky Republican rollout: the steady drip-drip-drip of the Russia investigations. The Trump administration is playing defense against multiple probes of the undisclosed contacts that key members of the President's campaign had with Russian operatives bent on influencing the 2016 presidential election. Washington, even under one-party control, can't function so long as lawmakers and the news media continue to get buffeted by new revelations, such as the failure by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to note his contacts with Russian officials and the remarkable spectacle of the former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, announcing he will invoke the Constitutional right against self-incrimination rather than testify before Congress about his own dealings with Russia. These aren't just gossipy distractions. Enacting major legislation requires a White House that is focused, confident and coherent. That is how the Reagan administration led a divided Congress to tax reform in 1986 and how the Obama White House won passage of a stimulus bill, auto industry bailout and health care reform. The White House, beset by leaks and low morale, is in no position to lead Congress through complex legislative fights. In fact, the overlapping Trump-Russia investigations require investigation and hearing time, adding considerably to Congress's already full inbox. That doesn't leave much time for reworking the health care system (estimated at one-sixth of the national economy) and even less time for tax reform (the other five-sixths). It remains to be seen whether voters will punish Republican members of Congress for the problems of the man in the White House. But while the Trump-Russia investigation grinds on, congressional Republicans would do well to find other ways to enact their agenda, mostly by working closely with GOP governors. Congress will need substantial buy-in at the state level to enact many of the big-ticket Republican agenda items, from reforming health care to building a border wall and other infrastructure. Now would be a good time to work with GOP governors on Republican agenda items like state-run high-risk health insurance pools and shovel-ready infrastructure projects."
Does Ryan Medicare plan make sense?,"We've all heard that Paul Ryan is Gov. Mitt Romney's running mate. But many still don't know the details of his proposals for health care reform. They offer a stark contrast to what the Obama administration would like to do. Medicare Medicare is a defined benefit program. That means the federal government decides each year what Medicare will cover. No matter what that costs, the government pays for most of it; individuals are responsible for the rest. Ryan's original plan, passed by the House of Representatives (but not the Senate) last year, would have changed Medicare to a defined contribution program, where the government would instead decide every year what it will  pay.  Under his plan, the government would give seniors that amount of money, in one form or another, to buy insurance on their own. Seniors would have had to pay for the difference between the cost of the insurance and the amount the government was willing to pay. The problem was that his original plan saved money by limiting how quickly the voucher seniors would get to buy health care would grow. This meant that by 2030, seniors would have been responsible for 68% of the cost of their insurance, likely too much for most to afford. At the end of 2011, though, Ryan made significant alterations to his proposal. With Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, he produced a plan that more closely resembles Romney's (although he changed things again in his 2013 budget, which Wyden does not support).  Instead of tying the amount of the voucher to an arbitrary increase in the future, it would be tied, in his 2011 proposal, to how much insurance costs. Each year, companies will submit bids for how much it will cost to provide insurance for a senior that year. The voucher would then be set at the price of the second-lowest bid. In other words, seniors could get the second-cheapest plan for very little. If they chose the cheapest plan, they would actually get a rebate. If they want anything more expensive, they would have to pay for the difference.  Moreover, traditional Medicare will be one of the choices. If it is the second cheapest, not much will change. If, however, it is more expensive, then seniors would have to pay for the difference, but in this way they will have the option to keep their Medicare. There are potential concerns, however. The first is that the proposal requires that the plans be ""actuarially equivalent,"" but not that they provide the same coverage benefits. This means that plans can tweak benefits they offer to try to preferentially attract healthy customers.  The second issue is that this plan won't save near the money that Ryan's first attempt did. If this plan had been implemented in 2009, it would have saved the federal government 9% that year. But that would have been a  one-time savings, and it wouldn't bend the cost curve much at all. Moreover, seniors would have had to pay about $64 a month for their traditional Medicare, which is a significant amount for many of them.  A third concern, voiced by many who oppose the Ryan plan, is that the details are insufficient to assume that traditional Medicare will be preserved. There may be a good reason for this: If the Affordable Care Act is too radical for many wishing to pass this proposal into law, it's hard to imagine they'll be in a position to defend something far more specific and comprehensive. Most significantly, though, this whole plan rests on the same rationale as Medicare Advantage did  (it lets Medicare beneficiaries get their coverage through private insurance companies)  when President George W. Bush first proposed it. That didn't clearly work. Many private plans were unable to come in under traditional Medicare, and only in certain markets in the country.  Medicaid With respect to Medicaid, Ryan (and Romney) would like to get the federal government far less involved. They want to convert the current program, where benefits are set at the federal level, and costs are shared between the federal and state governments, to one in which states are given far more flexibility to set benefits, and a block grant payment with which to pay for them. Some states like this plan, because it will allow them to alter benefits and coverage locally so they will be on the hook for less money in the future. Even though the federal government covers somewhere between 50% and 75% of Medicaid costs right now, the remaining spending is still a significant drain on state budgets. Unfortunately, savings to the federal government would come from drastically cutting the amount of money they will give states in the future. The only way states would be able to provide insurance to Medicaid recipients on way less money would be if they reduced the benefits or the number of beneficiaries.  If benefits aren't cut, and already low provider reimbursements aren't further reduced, then by 2021 about 19 million people, or one-third of all people on Medicaid, will need to be dropped from coverage. Many of those covered by Medicaid are very poor elderly people, or those who are blind or disabled. If states acted to preferentially protect those groups from cuts, then 27 million other people, many of them children and pregnant women, would be dropped from Medicaid. Although it will likely get far less media attention, the changes to Medicaid may be far more radical. Medicaid is already one of the cheapest forms of insurance around. There isn't that much fat to be trimmed, regardless of how much states might ""innovate.""  Although the focus of much of the election will be on Medicare, these proposed changes to Medicaid are far more severe, and will have far more immediate repercussions. The choice The Obama administration would like to reduce future health care spending by a number of means, including Accountable Care Organizations, the Independent  Advisory Board and other programs that focus on providers and hospitals to save money (discussed on CNN.com here). They believe, in general, that relying on experts and leaning on providers can bend the cost curve. The problem is that some see this as rationing. Ryan and Romney, on the other hand, believe that individuals should be the lever by which spending is reduced. They propose to decrease the amount the federal government pays for care by increasing the amount individuals pay and giving them more choices. They further believe that this will drive individuals to demand lower prices.  With respect to Medicare, the problem is that the amount seniors will be required to pay may be too much for many. Moreover, there is little evidence that prices will drop (they didn't for Medicare Advantage), and this could result in some seniors forgoing necessary care, which will have negative health consequences. Ironically, for all the talk about the concerns over the deficit, their plan also may not reduce Medicare spending as much as the Affordable Care Act does in the next decade. In a rational world, we'd try all these things. A bipartisan plan could come from Republicans accepting the Affordable Care Act as it stands for all those younger than 65, without further talk of repeal, in exchange for implementing the Ryan-Wyden plan for those 65 and older. After all, that proposal isn't really much different than the way the exchanges will work in the Affordable Care Act, with the exception that there is a public option  (which should be opened to everyone under 65 as well). Everyone gets something they want, with all the tools available being brought to bear on containing future costs. This would require compromise, though, something that is in short supply in election years. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
America's love/hate affair with government,"It's a problem that has been around for awhile, and the longer it stays, the tougher it is to reverse. That's because it's a riddle that's almost impossible to resolve: Americans want the government to fix our problems, but they don't trust the government to do it. We want health care to be fixed, Medicare and Social Security to stay intact, emergencies to be handled. We also want lower taxes along with a smaller—yet more responsive—government. All in all, we would like to spend less and get more.   Small wonder we don't believe government can do it, because it cannot.  According to the latest CNN/ORC poll, the public's trust in the federal government has dropped to an all-time low: Only 15% of Americans today say they trust the government to do what's right just about always or most of the time—down 10 points from about a year ago. The last time that number was perilously close to rock bottom was in 1994, after Bill Clinton lost health care reform. And it prompted the president to famously declare ""the era of big government is over."" Only it isn't. And that's the essential conundrum for Barack Obama. He's been a big-agenda president. He sees himself as transformational, so anything less would not do. But the more he did—economic stimulus, health care reform— the more the public recoiled. They didn't see the results, and hated the partisanship. All of which makes sense. Even the president himself, back in 2009, admitted he hadn't laid the groundwork for his big agenda. After all, how can you convince the public to expand the government while most people believe it's bloated and out of control? ""I understand that people are feeling uncertain about this. They feel anxious, partly because we've just become so cynical about what government can accomplish that people's attitudes are, you know, even though I don't like this devil, at least I know it, and I like that more than the devil I don't know,"" the president said at a press conference in the middle of the health care debate. ""So folks are skeptical. And that is entirely legitimate, because they haven't seen a lot of laws coming out of Washington lately that helped them."" All of which is true. But here's where leadership comes in—and has been lacking. The public distrusts government because its leaders haven't been able to work together to produce much of anything. Sure, we want it all—and that's our fault. But if we had some honest politicians out there, on both sides of the aisle, saying we can't have it all, we just might listen to them. Instead, we hear each side yammering about how the other guys solutions will kill the country or jobs or your bank account, so we figure we can't trust any of them.  It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. In fact, I would make the argument that—after watching the debt ceiling debacle—it would be strange to feel anything other than disrespect for Washington. And the more Congress fools with people's lives—like playing games over emergency funding—the more the public turns off.  And it's not going to get any better the closer we get to an election. It is true that distrust of government is nothing new.  It's also not news that we want the government to solve our problems even though we think it's full of scoundrels. ""There is nothing new about this ambivalence,"" scholars, and former Clinton administration officials, Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck point out in an essay called ""Change you can believe in requires a government you can trust."" They also make this important point: It's up to the president to lead. 'How ... the president deals with it may make the difference between success and failure."" The problem for Obama now is that he has dealt with the problems in all ways: As the partisan and as the conciliator. Yes, the often-recalcitrant freshmen Republicans have backed him into a corner, because they refuse to deal on much of anything. Even so, the president's initial identity—as a change-agent who can fix Washington—is gone.  Ronald Reagan understood the public's skepticism about government. He often joked that the scariest sentence in America is ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help.""  This president's problem is that he wants the government to help—only he hasn't been able to convince the public that government has changed. That's because it hasn't."
Democrats who run from Obama take a risk,"Democratic candidates who run from President Obama in red states where he is unpopular are making a big mistake. Their holding Obama at arm's length deprives voters of a clear choice at the ballot box. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is a great candidate for the U.S. Senate and is running a solid campaign. But she made a mistake when she refused to answer the question from the Louisville Courier-Journal about which presidential candidate she voted for in 2012.  Grimes should have said she voted for President Obama and then gone on to explain her policy differences with him. By ducking the question, all she did was make news out of her refusal to give a routine answer to a routine question. If Grimes doesn't care for Obama or what he stands for or has accomplished, just say so. Like most Democrats running this fall,  Grimes cannot win the election without the support of the Democratic base, and the Democratic base expects her to vote for a Democratic president against his Republican opponent.   Having forthrightly identified herself as a Democrat,  Grimes can go on to explain what kind of Democrat she is -- a Clinton Democrat, a moderate Democrat, a Kentucky Democrat, a Blue Dog Democrat, or simply a woman who has shown voters that she is wise and if elected, will work hard to put their interest first -- not simply try to score partisan points.  Grimes is more than a match for incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell.  She is every bit as tough as him, without his baggage of government shutdowns, his focus on making Obama a one-term president (and failing at it), and his love of extreme partisan politics.  She hit hard in the only debate of the race.  ""Sen. McConnell's 30-year record—it's gridlock, it's obstruction, it's extreme partisanship that's cost this nation a 16-day government shutdown.  We can't afford to go in that direction. My record speaks for itself. I'm an independent thinker who does what's right for the people of Kentucky, not partisan politics.""     The best McConnell seemed to be able to do was to mock her criticism of fabulous wealth:  ""Let me tell you: Her family has made more off the government in the last 10 years than I've been paid in a salary in all my time in the Senate,"" he said. OK, they are both wealthy, but what about the voters in Kentucky. Who's looking out for them?     McConnell, who is the self-acknowledged ""Proud Guardian of Gridlock,"" tried to make his gun-to-the-head negotiating (My way, or I shove the U.S. over the fiscal cliff) appear as compromising. It didn't work, and that's largely why he's in trouble now. Voters truly want to believe that candidates will attempt to find common ground.     Grimes, by contrast, forthrightly supported Obamacare and Kentucky's governor, calling him ""heroic"" for taking on McConnell so Kentuckians can have the financial security and health care they need.   If there is one rule for Democrats this year it is, ""Don't demoralize and demobilize the Democratic base.""  She may, in fact, never tell anyone her ballot vote.  But, Grimes does herself, and her party, no good by sidestepping her party's leader.  By electing the libertarian Rand Paul to the U.S. Senate and a Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, who has implemented health care reform on the state level, Kentucky voters have proven that they are willing to elect politicians with a wide array of views. Prior to the debate and Grimes' refusal to answer the question about who she voted for in the last presidential election, the polls have seesawed between  McConnell and Grimes, but McConnell never breaks 50%. For an incumbent to be stuck below 50% is a danger sign, and Mitch McConnell is the ultimate incumbent -- a figure of Washington, D.C., not Kentucky.  If she is to survive the final weeks of campaigning, Grimes must pivot back to the issues and perhaps even make some real news by saying what she will do for six years if elected versus trying to compete with McConnell on what to do to stop President Obama from doing his job for two more years.  Grimes is 35 with a long career ahead of her. If she doesn't win this time, does she want the Democratic base to boycott her for decades to come? Bill Clinton started in Arkansas as a supporter of George McGovern, proving that a progressive Democrat can win in a conservative border state. She is a fiercely independent, tough candidate and is capable of providing a positive case for how she will lead. But it's past time for Democrats running in these so-called red states to positively make a case for voters to elect them based on their agenda and priorities -- and not get caught up in trying to play these distancing games that could alienate the base voters they need to turn out on Election Day.

Six things you better know about Graham-Cassidy health care bill,"Just when we thought that the Senate was ready to move on to a bipartisan effort to stabilize health insurance markets, Senate Republicans have decided to take one more run at passing a strictly partisan measure to repeal and replace Obamacare over Democratic opposition. Considering the vast effect it would have, the Graham-Cassidy bill has received very little attention until the last week, and remains a mystery to most Americans. Here are six things you should know about it: 1) It passes the buck on health care reform from the national to the state governments Since Republican senators have been unable to decide what role the national government should play in making health care affordable and accessible for low- and moderate-income Americans, they are poised to adopt a bill that would simply dump the whole problem on the states. 2) It does nothing to stabilize health insurance markets in the short term Graham-Cassidy would continue the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansions, premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions for 2018 and 2019, but without the assistance that governors, insurance commissioners and other stakeholders and experts have been saying in bipartisan Senate committee hearings for the past two weeks is necessary to keep markets stable.   The bill would not, for example, provide funding for the billions of dollars insurers must spend under the law to reduce the amount low-income enrollees must spend for deductibles and other cost-sharing. It would repeal immediately the individual mandate but, unlike earlier Republican bills, would provide nothing in its place to encourage healthy people to maintain continuous coverage. Premiums could be expected to skyrocket as insurers attempt to deal with the continuing uncertainty.     3) It would slash funding for states that have made the Affordable Care Act work while increasing funds for states that have refused to do so Beginning in 2020, Graham-Cassidy would dramatically change the nature and availability of federal funding for health care. It would end, as of that date, the ACA's Medicaid expansions, premium tax credits and cost-sharing reduction payments, offering each state a block grant to use to provide coverage however it chooses.   While the block grants will initially relate to the amount the federal government is spending now on coverage in each state, over the period from 2020 to 2026, funding among the states would be radically reallocated.   The formula is complicated, but it will basically reapportion funding based on the proportion of each state's population with incomes between 50% and 138% of the federal poverty level of the country's total population in this income range. The effect of this will be to radically -- and absurdly -- reallocate funding from states (predominantly Democratic, such as California and New York) that have expanded coverage for their lower-income citizens through the opportunities afforded by the ACA to states such as Texas and Oklahoma (predominantly Republican) that have steadfastly resisted those opportunities.    4) It will require states to make big changes on an unrealistic time frame Graham-Cassidy's funding reallocation will pose a problem for both winners and losers. States that have expanded coverage will be forced to cut back dramatically -- there will simply not be enough funding for them to maintain current coverage levels, and the gap between the cost of coverage and federal funds available will grow each year.  As states are doing this, other provisions of Graham-Cassidy will be limiting federal funding for traditional Medicaid, further burdening the states.  States that until now have shown little interest in covering their uninsured, on the other hand, will suddenly receive a flood of federal cash that they will have to figure out how to spend. The federal exchange will be gone as of 2020, so each state will have to set up its own program for distributing the money.  Each will have to adopt legislation and regulations and set up new agencies within a two-year period.  Each state legislature will face the same struggle that Congress has gone through for the past year in deciding how to do this, and some states will likely not make the deadline. Even the favored states may see their uninsured population mushroom. 5) It undermines the protections the Affordable Care Act has afforded people with pre-existing conditions Graham-Cassidy would also allow states to get rid of the ACA's requirements that all insurers cover certain benefits -- such as maternity or mental health services -- and abandon its prohibition against insurers charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions.   The bill says that states will have to claim that they will maintain access to ""adequate and affordable"" health care for people with pre-existing conditions, but it is hard to imagine how they will do this if they allow insurers to drop benefits that people with pre-existing conditions need or allow insurers to charge them unaffordable rates. And there is no enforcement mechanism for states that do not live up to their claims. 6) In 2027, the program falls off a cliff Finally, Graham-Cassidy block grant funding for all states ends in 2027. Congress may extend the program at that point, but there are no promises. Uncertainty for consumers and insurers will simply continue.  Graham-Cassidy proposes a poorly thought out, poorly understood radical experiment with America's health care. It can only be hoped that a handful of Republican Senators who have all summer long insisted on reasonable, bipartisan, legislation to improve, not destroy, our health-care system will stand their ground."
One night will decide Obama's fate,"President Barack Obama will not lose his re-election bid because of Eric Holder.   As sensational as the headlines surrounding the Fast and Furious controversy might be, recent history tells us Holder is only the topic of conversation right now.   Come July, we'll forget all about it much in the way the Keystone Pipeline is hardly mentioned.   Remember, it was just last week that all of the talk was about immigration and the Latino vote.  The week before that, it was same-sex marriages.   So Holder -- and the rest of those those sexy subplots -- are really just there to keep us entertained until the main event, the only event that matters leading to the election: the first debate. Everything before that will will likely fade away by November, especially for independents.  It's what happens when Obama and Mitt Romney finally square off on Wednesday, October 3, that will have the greatest influence on those who are undecided. The candidates will debate at the University of Denver, in the first of three planned presidential debates.  But you know the old saying: the first impression is the last impression. So if Obama stumbles in the first, he might as well spend the rest of the fall packing.   Team Romney knows this, which is why what we saw in the Republican primary debates is not what we're going to see in October. Back then, Romney came across flat and on the defensive in the first debate, but this time expect him to come out swinging, questioning nearly every decision the president has ever made -- from cash for clunkers and bailouts to health care reform and the stimulus package.  The presumptive Republican nominee won't have to knock Obama out, but if the night ends with the president appearing to be on the back of his of his heels, the game is over. After all, what could he possibly say in the next two debates or on the campaign trail that would erase an image of him struggling to defend his own record? Especially against a guy who continues to struggle to be liked, much in the same way a rigid Richard Nixon struggled against the charismatic John F. Kennedy, the wooden Al Gore paled next to the friendly demeanor of George W. Bush and listless John McCain couldn't come close to igniting the crowd like Obama in 2008.     But to complicate things, Obama is defending his record against a man who is not afraid to distort the facts (i.e. lie) to win brownie points. That's not my opinion, that's what the people who currently endorse Romney said.  After a debate in Florida, Newt Gingrich said Romney gave ""the most blatantly dishonest performance by a presidential candidate I've ever seen.""  Earlier, Rick Santorum said he was ""stunned that Mitt Romney does not have the ability to discern something that is blatantly false.""  On top of that, Obama has to find a way to remind the country where it was before he took office without appearing to be blaming former President Bush because, fair or not, people don't want to hear it. And unlike the backdrop of 2008, Obama doesn't have the luxury of speaking in generic hypotheticals because the country will have specific examples in 2012 to look at.    Nowhere to run.   Nowhere to hide.   And not a teleprompter in sight.   Just Romney, the list of promises Obama made in 2008 and his list of accomplishments heading into the stretch run of 2012.   If he's re-elected, it won't be based on how he handles gaffes or controversies such as Fast and Furious. It will be because he took the GOP's best shot and came out on top on the one night doing so mattered most.     Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion"
DNC puts disability issues front and center,"Every election cycle, as candidates traverse the country with messages carefully tailored for every possible cross-section of the population, there's at least one voting bloc that's consistently ignored: people with disabilities. It's a puzzling oversight, given that by some measures, more than one in five Americans has a disability, a number that will only continue to grow as the baby boomers age.  This year, though, the Democrats are making disability issues a central part of their convention. On Tuesday night, which happened to be the 26th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, several disability rights advocates took the stage to declare their support for Hillary Clinton.  ""As a disabled person, I became a lawyer to advocate that disability is not a problem to be cured, but a part of our identity and diversity,"" said Dynah Haubert, a lawyer who works for a disability rights organization. ""And that's why on the 26th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I'm with her."" After a presentation on her support for health care reform, Ryan Moore, a health care advocate with spondyloepiphyseal Dysplasia dwarfism, spoke about his longtime friendship with Clinton. ""I wish everyone could get to know Hillary's heart like I have,"" he said. ""She always looks out for the little guy — no pun intended.""  The contrast between the DNC and last week's Republican National Convention was sharp. As disability activists were quick to point out, the RNC's sole speaker with a disability focused almost exclusively on his own odds-defying recovery from a spinal cord injury, rather than the lack of access and systemic discrimination faced by people with disabilities.  One Twitter user concluded, ""I have to say it's only day 2 of the #DemConvention but it has been 100% better on disability than #RNCinCLE.""  It's not difficult to draw other unflattering comparisons between the two major party candidates. After a rocky start in the spring of 2015, when Hillary Clinton was criticized for briefly parking her campaign van in a handicapped spot, her campaign took significant steps on disability issues. Clinton added a dedicated page on her website for them and unveiled a campaign focusing on autism. On Twitter, an advocate noted using the hashtag #CriptheVote that disability is mentioned more than 30 times in this year's Democratic Party platform. On Tuesday night, Sen. Tom Harkin, one of the architects of the ADA, extolled Clinton's commitment to the issue, especially her opposition to tiered wages that allow employers to pay workers with disabilities well below the minimum wage, a policy that contributes to high rates of poverty among people with disabilities. In an especially moving moment at the end of the speech, he taught the crowd to sign ""America."" All this might be less noteworthy if Donald Trump didn't present such a staggeringly negative contrast. He brushed off attacks after he mocked a New York Times reporter with a physical disability. Later, he explained he had spent ""a lot of money"" making his buildings accessible, although his properties also have been sued multiple times for ADA violations. When the advocacy organization RespectAbility asked candidates to fill out a questionnaire about disability rights, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and at least three of Trump's erstwhile Republican rivals responded. From Trump? Nothing. In a speech on Monday night, disability rights advocate Anastasia Somoza, who has worked with the Clinton Foundation, directly called out Trump. ""Donald Trump doesn't see me, he doesn't hear me, and he definitely doesn't think for me,"" said Somoza. Even Bill Clinton noted the difference between the two candidates in his speech: ""Hillary never made fun of people with disabilities, she tried to empower them."" Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. But even if this year the prospect of greater political polarization is inspiring more people with disabilities to vote for Clinton, many will still face challenges getting to the polls — thanks to everything from inaccessible election sites and transportation to the polls to the effects of strict voter ID laws that could have a disproportionate effect on voters with disabilities. And the political party that seems to be pulling ahead on disability rights is still far from inclusive. After all,  fewer than 10% of Democratic delegates at this year's convention have a disability.  That's why this year's prominence at the DNC isn't just a victory for disability issues, it's also a call to do better in the future — one that both political parties would do well to heed."
"Democrats, why aren't you listening to the protests?","National Democratic leaders, fresh from a shellacking in congressional districts and statehouses from coast to coast, should wake up to the reality that the party's path to electoral power runs through the streets, where an energized portion of the party's base has been marching for many months.  On three hot-button issues -- climate change, higher pay for fast-food workers and fairness in the criminal justice system -- left-leaning Americans have mounted sophisticated, passionate campaigns that have sparked and swayed public conversation.   The question is whether Democrats, whose electoral losses can be traced back to low voter participation, will follow the lead of activists whose numbers have been swelling throughout 2014. Right now, things don't look too hopeful.  Instead of drawing on the energy and creativity of the activists, Democratic leaders are engaging in a round of finger-pointing, blaming one another for errors of timing and messaging that contributed to the recent electoral losses.  Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, who as chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee had the task of developing a winning message for the party this year, recently delivered an extraordinary speech chastising his fellow Dems for pursuing President Obama's signature issue of health care reform.  ""Unfortunately, Democrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them. We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem — health care reform,"" Schumer said in a speech at the National Press Club. ""We should have done it. We just shouldn't have done it first."" That drew a sharp retort from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""We come here to do a job, not keep a job,"" she said in a statement to CNN. ""There are more than 14 million reasons why that's wrong,"" she added -- a pointed reference to the number of Americans now getting health insurance under Obamacare. The feud is music to the ears of Republicans. ""Democrats are trying to figure out what they believe and who they represent"" is how conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer put it.  That may be overstating matters -- this isn't the ""civil war"" Krauthammer describes -- but Democrats clearly need to think about how and why they haven't been connecting with voters lately. Schumer and Pelosi are both partly right. There's no question that the titanic battle to extend health care to the uninsured was always a matter of helping a minority of Americans to finally get benefits that 85% of us already enjoyed.  Most people, anyway you look at it, did not need Obamacare themselves (although many had children and other relatives who benefited).  But as Pelosi and others pointedly reminded Schumer, getting health benefits to 14 million people is a titanic achievement that Democrats have been attempting for a generation. And the program helped Democrats make inroads with Latino voters,  whose support for Obamacare helped the Democrats carry the White House and hold a Senate majority in 2012. But the bickering on Capitol Hill misses an important point: The 2014 elections had the lowest turnout since World War II, meaning the issues and candidates that Democrats (and Republicans) put forward didn't stir the overwhelming majority of voters.  At the same time, activists have enjoyed far greater success shaping issues and putting them on the public agenda: a track record Democrats would do well to learn from.  On September 21, less than 60 days before the anemic-turnout election, more than 300,000 people marched in New York, according to an estimate by the organizers -- and more than 2,600 events were staged in solidarity around the world -- to call attention to the perils of climate change.  On December 4, thousands of fast-food employees walked off the job in 190 cities across 35 states to demand better pay.  And we haven't seen the end of nationwide civil rights demonstrations calling attention to controversial cases of police killing unarmed black boys and men. Athletes, politicians, at least one police chief,  as well as the president of Harvard  and dozens of congressional staff members have all made public displays of solidarity under the banner #BlackLivesMatter.  There's no shortage of movements that have caught fire across the nation. If Democrats want to get beyond this year's low-turnout losses, they should get serious about understanding why politically active Americans seem to be choosing picket lines over polling sites -- and then tailor a message that can lead to victory in 2016 and beyond.

Want to improve health care? Focus on hospitals,"As Congress and the Trump administration debate the future of America's health care system, they should go beyond the issues of access and cost and recognize an equally important priority: that patients come first, so health reform should also focus on quality of care. Seen statistically in hospitalized patients' complication and mortality rates, and in the percentages of individuals with chronic diseases who are kept out of the hospital with effective preventative care, these quality ""outcomes"" are the overlooked elephant in the room for health reform.   We recently analyzed 22 million hospital admissions across the country, examining two dozen common conditions, including such widespread illnesses as heart disease, diabetes and post-operative infections. What we found were surprisingly large variations between the best- and worst-performing hospitals. Patients in the worst-performing hospitals -- those in the bottom 10% -- were three times more likely to die and 13 times more likely to experience complications than those in the top-performing hospitals. The probability of dying in the hospital after a heart attack or stroke was more than twice as high in low-performing hospitals as in high-performing ones. And patients in low-performing hospitals were nearly 20 times more likely to experience IV line infections and more than three times more likely to contract post-operative sepsis infections than in high-performing hospitals. It would not be overly dramatic to characterize some of the outcome differences as alarming, including significant differences among hospitals within the same metropolitan area. For example, if you had called 911 for a heart attack in Phoenix, you could have been treated at a hospital with a 5% death rate or a facility with a 15% death rate, depending on which of 14 local hospitals cared for you. Among the 26 hospitals in New York City, you could have been taken to a hospital with a 4% death rate or one with a 21% death rate.   Most Americans know that hospitals vary in quality, but do they realize the wrong choice can increase their chance of death so significantly? The standard answer from many medical professionals when confronted with such variations is that they're often caused by factors beyond their control, such as the patient's health or income. But that's only part of the story, or so we found. After rigorously risk-adjusting for more than 80 distinct measures in patient health, demographics, socio-economics and health system factors -- including whether the hospitals were in urban or rural areas, the prevalence of smoking in the area, and so forth -- we saw that the variations persisted. Indeed, challenging conventional wisdom, the study found some poor-performing hospitals serving mainly high-income, largely white populations and some high-performing hospitals serving primarily low-income, minority populations. This was true across the country, between states, within states and within cities. In other words, where you live might determine if you live.  We can't say conclusively why such outcome differences exist and persist even after risk adjustment. But it's clear that what happens inside a hospital matters a lot. Measuring, reporting and acting on outcomes provides a real opportunity to avert harm, save lives and lower health care costs. Small steps are being taken in this area, such as measuring IV line infection rates and reducing reimbursements to hospitals with high readmission rates. But more needs to be done. The policy changes being contemplated for next year are rooted, advocates say, in the fundamental American ideals of choice and competition. But a consumer-based, patient-centered health system requires individuals, families and third-party payers, whether government or private insurers, to know what they're buying.  Similarly, doctors and health care professionals can't effectively set goals and make improvements if they don't know where they stand. Our experience indicates that doctors and hospital administrators want to provide the best possible care. They mean well. They are mission driven. But they need clear and objective data on their hospital's performance so they know where to focus their efforts. Interestingly, to conduct our research we were forced to use 2011 hospital data because the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, in 2012 -- ostensibly to ""enhance confidentiality"" -- eliminated ""state and hospital identifiers"" from its National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. That's like knowing there's been a big pileup on the Beltway, but not knowing where. Outcomes data from every hospital in the United States, analyzed at both the disease level and procedure level, should be compiled and made available for legitimate research and quality improvement purposes.  We're not looking to generate tabloid headlines. Hospitals should be given ample time to react to the data and improve. After that, the same type of information should be made publicly available -- so that patients, in consultation with their doctors, can select hospitals where they're most likely to get the best care, rather than those that simply accept their insurance. Our research should send a strong message to policy makers that good health insurance, no matter how affordable or accessible, is not synonymous with good care. You don't go to an Italian restaurant and expect great sushi. Similarly, just because a hospital is good at knee replacements doesn't mean it's good at brain surgery. Collecting and analyzing data on outcomes, providing transparency, and driving performance improvements should be core elements of health-care reform. The American people deserve nothing less."
Why GOP health plan is immoral,"I have referred to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act as the ""Make America Sick Again"" bill. The numbers from the Congressional Budget Office make that an apt description. According to the CBO, 24 million more Americans could be uninsured by 2026 under the House Republican bill than under Obamacare. I do give Republicans points for consistency: They have always been clear that they see the very existence of Medicare and Medicaid as signs of weakness, and, as well, they resolutely pursue spending and tax policies that exacerbate the gap between rich and poor.   But three numbers in the Republican American Health Care Act tell us all we need to understand about Republican efforts to undermine low- and middle-income Americans. First, when the CBO says the Affordable Care Act repeal will reduce the deficit by $337 billion over the 2017-2026 period, this is accomplished largely by kicking people off Medicaid. Under the Republican bill, there will be a 2020 freeze on Medicaid expansion and the federal government will reduce funding from 100% to just 90% leaving the states to fill the gap -- a gap that will then be a political football, with Republicans who now control two-thirds of state legislatures doing everything possible to make Medicaid eligibility harder.  It's also worth noting that the Medicaid costs per person figure will be computed at the 2016 pricing, which, even under the 100% federal contribution, is too low because of rising health care costs.  Second, the CBO's noting of the reductions of revenues (generated under the ACA) doesn't underscore why: The Republican replacement bill offers a huge tax cut, essentially a transfer of wealth, for the top 1%. Principally, that tax cut comes by eliminating the 3.8% tax on investment income and the 0.9% hike on the Medicare tax for the highest earners. This will also result in bringing the insolvency of Medicare closer, a critical reason the AARP opposes the bill.   Lastly, the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. In my view, the only solution is a single-payer ""Medicare for all"" system, which the ACA didn't advance toward. But, the ACA did reduce the uninsured numbers from roughly 47 million down to 28 million. The CBO says those numbers will increase: ""In 2026, an estimated 52 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law."" Essentially, the Republican bill will almost double the number of people who would have been uninsured in 2026 if the ACA stayed in place. That's just immoral.  Vladimir Putin, a popular topic of conversation here, has taken advantage of a system that concentrates wealth and power in the hands of a few Russian oligarchs; Republicans appear to be doing the same thing through health care ""reform"" and tax cuts."
Ho-hum reaction to shutdown says it all,"It speaks volumes that America's government could be shut down with its leaders blaming one another for bringing the country to the edge of the economic abyss, and the response of much of the world, including the leading financial markets, would essentially be a yawn.  The most stunning thing about this first shutdown of the U.S. government in almost two decades is the degree to which it is a nonevent, considered par for the course given the sad state of affairs in the nation's capital.  Voters may be angry.  They may be depressed.  But there are no mass demonstrations.  Congress' approval rating may have hit new lows, but beyond that, the response has been a shrug.    Here in Washington, traffic is still lousy.  Lobbyists still schmooze over restaurant breakfast tables.  People shake their heads in disgust.  But no one even bothers to feign surprise.    Speaking with institutional investors, I was struck to hear that they, too, consider this episode to be not much different from the histrionics of an unhappy child.  Even financial professionals, whose world and well-being would be rocked by the cataclysm that would be triggered by America's failure to pay its debts, have not reacted with panic. (Today, during and after House Speaker John Boehner'sdefiant press conference, which seemed to presage a drawn-out crisis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average barely budged, remaining slightly positive throughout.) When financial professionals are asked why they remain calm, they say that someone will blink because someone always blinks.  And they say if nobody blinks, perhaps a brief market spike downward would serve as a wake-up call to reason.   But more important, nearly all those with whom I spoke believe the United States won't default even if the debt ceiling  isn't lifted because there are ways the president can keep the checks going out  -- such as simply paying the debt out of available cash and holding back on other payments not tied to the ""full faith and credit of the U.S. government.""  The result is that rather than action, this pathetic standoff has produced a lot of media sound and fury signifying, just as Shakespeare once observed, nothing.   Interested observers are understandably depressed, legitimately concerned that we have lost our mojo as a country, that this is a sign of decline, based on the fact that at this moment in U.S. history, our government just doesn't work.   Although this is primarily the fault of the GOP and notably and undeniably a tiny fraction of crackpots within the party who are throwing a public tantrum because they didn't get their way on health care reform, it is equally undeniable that both parties have contributed to the pitiful state of a democratic system that was once a shining example to the world.    Both parties are responsible for the gerrymandering that has produced a modern political reality in which the vast majority of members of Congress are in safe districts and never feel pressure from opposing views.  They have no reason ever to compromise and, indeed, are penalized for doing so because their future depends on primary wins, and they see those who vote in primaries -- the most extreme members of the party faithful -- as the group to whom they must answer.     Both parties have engineered and failed to challenge the corrupt campaign finance system that gives check writers power over law writers and undercuts the most basic principles of equity in democracy.   Both parties have contributed to the shrillness of the debate.  Both parties have used antiquated Senate rules to block progress by their opponents and the confirmation of nominees of presidents they oppose. And both have done these things for so long now that these flaws in our system are seen as enduring and impermeable to change.  In the end, this is not a problem of a government shutdown or even of the impending breach of the debt ceiling, certainly not about the nonsense spewing from obstructionist tea party clowns who claim it is about defending ""individual liberties.""    It is also not as simple as refusing to negotiate with political hostage takers as the president suggests, although he is absolutely right to resist their crude techniques.   Rather, it is a governance crisis of the first order, one in which the solution can only be massive system-wide reform. It's a crisis that shows itself not just in the petty squabbles of elites, nor in the lack of a serious discussion about addressing the real  problems confronting the country, but is best illustrated by the cynicism and relative indifference of the electorate.  They are not protesting, not voting out the bastards.  Rather, most disturbingly, they are saying, ""We don't believe you any more and we are starting not to care.""

Court's ruling a 'Frankenstein's Monster',"Today's heart-wrenching, baby-splitting Supreme Court decision illegitimately rewrote the Affordable Care Act in order to save it. It's certainly gratifying that a majority on the court rejected the government's dangerous assertion of power to require people to engage in economic activity in order to then regulate that activity.   That vindicates everything that we who have been leading the constitutional challenge have been saying:  The government cannot regulate inactivity. It cannot, as Chief Justice John Roberts put it in summarizing his opinion from the bench, regulate mere existence.  Justifying the individual mandate under the taxing power of Congress, however, in no way rehabilitates the government's constitutional excesses. As Justice Anthony Kennedy said in summarizing his four-justice dissent, ""Structure means liberty."" If Congress can avoid the Constitution's structural limits simply by ""taxing"" anything it doesn't like, its power is no more limited than it would be had it done so under the Commerce Clause.   Opinion: Health care victory, but still a long way to go While imposing new taxes may be politically unpopular and therefore harder to do than creating new regulations, that political check does not obviate constitutional ones -- and in any event, Congress had avoided even that political gauntlet here by explicitly structuring the individual mandate as a commercial regulation. Nor does the Supreme Court vindicate its constitutional legerdemain by rewriting the Medicaid expansion to tie only new federal funding to an acceptance of burdensome and fundamentally transformative regulations. While correct on its face -- and a good exposition of the spending power and what strings the federal government can attach to its funds -- that analysis is relevant to a hypothetical statute, not the one that Congress actually passed when it passed health care reform legislation. Opinion: Liberty lost? The Supreme Court punts Moreover, allowing states to opt out of the new Medicaid regime while leaving the rest of Obamacare in place throws the insurance market into disarray, increases costs to individuals, and gives states a Hobson's choice -- different but no less tragic than the one it previously faced. As Kennedy wrote in dissent, while purporting to apply judicial modesty or restraint, the court's rewriting of the law is anything but restrained or modest. In short, we have reaped the fruits of two poisonous trees of constitutional jurisprudence: On the one (liberal activist) hand, there are no judicially administrable limits on federal power. On the other (conservative pacifist) one, we must defer to Congress and presume (or construe) its legislation to be constitutional. It is that tired old framework -- with four justices in the former category and one in the latter -- that produced the Frankenstein's Monster of today's ruling.   Gergen: Are voters ready to move on?  What judges should be doing instead is applying the Constitution, no matter whether that leads to upholding or striking down legislation. And a correct application of the Constitution inevitably rests on the Madisonian principles of ordered liberty and limited government that the document embodies. In any event, the ball now shifts to another court, that of the people -- the ultimate sovereigns who, in ratifying the Constitution, delegated certain limited powers to the federal government. Many have opposed Obamacare all along and it is they who must now decide -- or not -- to rein in the out-of-control government whose unconstitutional actions have taken us to the brink of economic disaster.

Cornell West and Tavis Smiley are wrong -- Obama hasn't failed the poor,"I have the utmost respect for Dr. Cornel West and Tavis Smiley. Their accomplishments are vast. Dr. West, an academic philosopher at Princeton University, has for decades spoken up for the poor. Tavis Smiley, talk show host and author, has always used his platform to discuss the issues of the black community and the country as a whole. President Obama said during the 2008 campaign that we should be able to disagree without being disagreeable. That is a simple injunction that many in politics do not follow. That said, I respectfully disagree with West and Smiley's characterization of President Obama's first term in office.  West has simply described it as a failure, and referred to the president as ""the black mascot of Wall Street oligarchs,"" and the ""head of the American killing machine."" Smiley has accused the president of ignoring the issues of the black community. The two held a 16-city ""Poverty Tour"" earlier this month, during which they aired their complaints about Obama. To hear them tell it, one would think that Obama is in the back pocket of Wall Street and the banks and has turned his back on the working poor, impoverished and middle class in America. I am not looking at President Obama's first term through rose colored glasses. There is always room for criticism and improvement; our president's decisions are far from perfect. But the criticism from West and Smiley leave out a lot. They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole. Let's take Obama and health care reform. Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which he shepherded and signed into law, insurance companies are no longer allowed to deny insurance to individuals because of pre-existing conditions. Children can now remain covered by their parents' insurance until age 26. No longer will there be kids fresh out of college starting in entry level positions walking around with no health insurance. The prescription drug cost for Medicare recipients was cut by 50%. More than 30 million people who did not have access to coverage will now have that access. This legislation is not perfect -- it lacks the public option many had hoped for -- but it is the largest federal reform in a lifetime, a tremendous accomplishment. Then there is the Children's Health Insurance Re-authorization Act, signed into law by Obama, which provides health care to millions of kids . Let's talk Obama and education. President Obama signed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which invests $5 billion in early childhood programs like Head Start. Studies show such programs help kids stay in school longer, earn more money in the long term and have lower involvement in crime. President Obama also expanded Pell Grants, which help low income students pay for college. He has done what no other president had done before by enacting the Student Aid and Financial Responsibility Act, which makes college more affordable while ending federal subsidies to private lenders and replacing them with a Direct Loan program. This is a direct contradiction of West's claims that the president has ""sold out"" to the big banks. The banks lost billions on this act; in taking them out of the equation, students are no longer held hostage to credit markets. Somehow, these accomplishments, which have a direct impact on the poor are not mentioned in West's and Smiley's critique. There's more. Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination Through the HIRE Act, signed in March, 2010, Obama gave $18 billion in tax breaks for small businesses. He signed a bill extending unemployment insurance. To review, then: Putting money into community colleges, job readiness programs, putting actual checks into actual hands -- these things don't sound like the actions of someone who doesn't care about the poor and impoverished. There is a very real crisis in this country. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 45 million Americans live in poverty. Unemployment is 9.1 %. Such statistics are, as Rep. Maxine Waters has said, ""unconscionable."" President Obama has been demonstrating that he knows this. So why make someone like him your enemy when you are fighting on the same side? If West and Smiley would like Obama to do more, that's valid. If they feel, like Rep. Elijah Cummings, that ""people need to know that the president feels their pain,"" that too is understandable. But the facts simply don't support the accusation that Obama holds a laissez-faire attitude toward economically marginalized Americans.   He has faced huge partisan resistance. His campaign adviser, David Axelrod, says Obama will soon announce a jobs plan that is expected to include an extension of payroll tax cuts, new revenue for transportation projects and an extension of emergency unemployment benefits. He notes that there's nothing in the proposal ""that reasonable people shouldn't be able to agree on,"" yet many Republicans are already preparing to reject whatever the president puts on the table. Are they trying to stymie job creation initiatives, and then blame the president for high unemployment when the election rolls around? I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions. But West and Smiley have a responsibility to present a fair and complete picture, not a skewed version. Could their slanted criticism result in so many of the working poor and impoverished working class becoming so discouraged that they stay home on election day in 2012? If they think they have issues with the president not doing enough for the poor now, wait and see what happens if the opposition takes office. Then they would really need a poverty tour. We must not forget the mess that President Obama walked into. Obama said in his victory speech, ""even as we celebrate tonight we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime. ...The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year, or even one term."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Etan Thomas."
The health care fix won't work,"The implementation of the Affordable Care Act is not going well.  First, the volume of people showing up to HealthCare.gov on October 1 completely crashed the site. Then, it turned out the data being passed up and back was completely corrupt.  Then, millions of Americans began discovering that plans they ""liked"" were being canceled, and they were being told it was because of the Affordable Care Act.  President Obama announced an administrative fix to this problem on Thursday: an extension that allows insurers to  keep people on health care plans that the Affordable Health Care act would not have allowed. The cancellations had posed a real problem for the Obama administration, because they flew in the face of what many believe is a core promise of health care reform: that you could keep your policy if you liked it. Millions are finding out this isn't true. Those of us who have been in the weeds of health policy have known this for a long time. Most Americans did not. The Affordable Care Act changes the way insurance is regulated. It declares that many services are now mandatory. This included a lot of preventive care, as well as maternity care. Any policies that don't provide these services will no longer be offered. Other policies had very low annual or lifetime limits. These, too, have to go away. Anyone who had one will need to find a new policy. It's very likely that newer policies, with more robust benefits, will be more expensive. That will make many people unhappy. We can argue that the new policies are still a good deal, or that much of that cost will be defrayed by subsidies, or that future protections to both beneficiaries and their families are worth the added cost, but that's somewhat beside the point. Many people feel like they were told they could keep their insurance, and now they think they have been lied to. Obama knows the law is in trouble. Many Democrats feel like they took hard votes and stuck their necks out to support the law, and now that there's a perception that the executive branch has dropped the ball, their support is not as strong. There are a number of bills and fixes being debated. That won't be easy, though. That's in part because no insurance plan sticks around forever. Plans change from year to year, premiums change from year to year, coverage changes from year to year, and deductibles, copays, and co-insurance change from year to year. They always have. It has never been the case that you could be guaranteed that your plan would exist -- as it does today -- for as long as you would like. I've had plans I've liked canceled many times in my 10 years working at my current job. One bill being put forth in the House would allow insurers to continue to offer plans that have been discontinued due to the Affordable Care Act. The problem with that is that many insurance companies don't want to continue to offer those plans indefinitely. They don't make sense financially. Therefore, passing this law won't stop millions of Americans from getting cancellation notices anyway. A different bill in the Senate would force insurance companies to continue to offer those plans or leave the state entirely. If you thought the Affordable Care Act was a government takeover before, this bill is much, much worse. It would compel insurance companies to comply with a whole new host of potentially unprofitable regulations.  The truth of the matter is there is no easy solution here. Disrupting the current system isn't a bug of health care reform; it's a feature. It's what was supposed to happen. All reform will do so. Even Republican proposals, like Sen. John McCain's when he was running for president, to change the health insurance tax deduction, would have completely upended the employer-sponsored health insurance system.  Then-Sen. Obama attacked him savagely for just that back in 2008. It's fine for President Clinton and others to just ""demand"" this be fixed. Unfortunately, it can't be, at least not easily and not cheaply. Letting healthy people keep these plans (because most of those in the pre-Affordable Care Act individual market are healthier) and stay out of the exchanges will raise the premiums for everyone else, and thus the amount the government will have to pay in subsidies. Forcing insurance companies to continue to offer old plans in a new marketplace could wind up hurting their bottom line significantly. Obama's administrative fix, much like the House bill, allow plans offered this year to remain in place if people want them. But that will just shift blame to the insurance companies when they cancel them. For many of the reasons above, they won't want to keep them going. The real problem here, and one that few are addressing, is that the old health care system isn't that good. We wanted to change it. Doing so means that it, well, changes. If we liked our old health care system, we could keep it. But we didn't, and so at some point we're going to have to accept a new one. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Five New Year's resolutions for President Obama,"As millions of Americans think about how they can do better in 2014 through their New Year resolutions, President Obama might want to make a few of his own.  Although it is true that the president has faced a horrendous political environment -- filled with tea party Republicans intent on obstructing every proposal and media that are often too willing to report dubious facts -- Obama has not made his situation much easier for himself.   In a number of areas, he might think about strategies that can improve his political standing and put him in a better position for the political fights over immigration, the budget, climate change and foreign policy that loom ahead. Treat your Democrats well: President Obama has not taken enough care of Democrats on Capitol Hill. Throughout the year, Democrats have continued to express frustration with the White House for putting them into extraordinarily difficult political situations and sometimes leaving them to stand alone as they face the fallout.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was reportedly angry with the president for failing to give his caucus any credit for helping him to get out of the jam with the health care website. ""I did communicate to him,"" Reid told The Hill, ""that there have been things done by the White House that improved the health care bill, and those fixes were suggested originally by my senators, and they got no credit for it. I thought that was improper.""  Last week, House Democrat John Lewis criticized the administration for not listening to the advice of civil rights leaders regarding appointments for the federal bench in Georgia.  This story fits a familiar pattern that has created ongoing tensions with Capitol Hill since 2009.   Obama needs to remember that his fate is closely tied to the Democrats on Capitol Hill -- Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi should be his best friends -- and he needs them to help him  in his struggles with Republicans. Sweat the small stuff: There is considerable evidence that President Obama seems uninterested with detail.  His major concern is in the big picture, trying to find ways to achieve his long-term policy goals, whether that be a diplomatic solution to the nuclear buildup in the Middle East or achieving health care reform, without as much interest in the nitty-gritty of how these policies will happen.  It is true that any president needs to keep his eye on the big picture in order to avoid the fate of President Jimmy Carter, who became so mired in the minutiae of policy that he lost his ability to lead the nation through crisis. But as former Secretary of State Colin Powell says in his famous presentation about leadership, ""Check the small things. The devil is in the details; sometimes the solution to a sticky problem, too. Don't sweat the small stuff, but don't ignore it, either.""  The dangers of President Obama's approach became apparent with the rollout of health care reform, in which the president and his team were not on top of the details of implementation in the weeks leading up to the launch of the website, and they allowed technical mistakes to turn into a huge political fiasco.  The continual delays over implementing other parts of the program have also caused huge embarrassment and offered fodder to his political enemies. The President can't afford for this to happen again. He will need to hold more of his staff accountable for these kinds of mistakes, bringing in some fresh voices, as he has done with John Podesta, and getting rid of those who have made huge mistakes. He needs to realize that making sure that the small stuff is in order is essential to big achievements.  Control the conversation: For a president who is as professorial as Barack Obama, it is difficult to accept the harsh reality of the media world within which Washington operates.  It is an environment where spurious information goes viral and political rhetoric appears as fact. The blogosphere makes it difficult for producers and editors to control the flow of information, while the plethora of partisan reporting and commentary makes it nearly impossible for consumers of the news to separate fact from fiction. President Obama's outlook has been to sit back and allow the truth to find its way to the surface. He has maintained a steadfast determination that, given the facts, Americans will reach the right decision.  But in our political world, this just doesn't happen. The result has been that his opponents have been remarkably effective at shaping the national dialogue over public policy. President Obama has been forced to constantly play defense, to explain his failures and to dig himself out of holes rather than spending time talking about what he has done and what else he hopes to accomplish.  Re-energize the grass roots: When Obama started on his road to the White House, he thrived on the energy and support he received from average Americans who were inspired by his call for a new kind of politics and his determination to have a campaign that was built from the bottom up. The local networks of campaign supporters spread the word about who this candidate was while raising money and motivating voters to line up behind his campaign. The enthusiasm and energy of his grass-roots supporters have grown weak. Many of his supporters have become disillusioned with a president who seemed far too much like other politicians and who abandoned some of his key promises in areas like national security. The revelations about the NSA surveillance program were a huge blow to these constituencies.   This is most notable with younger Americans, once enamored with the president but now disillusioned by broken promises on issues such as civil liberties and a still-difficult economy. With the 2014 midterms as a focal point, the President should get back to communicating with grass-roots Americans and shaping the agenda of his final years in office based on some of the issues they feel have been sidetracked in the past few years. Focus, focus, focus: Over the past year, the President has frequently moved from one subject to another without a clear rhyme or reason. One of the few areas where a president has control is over his or her own agenda.  During the President's first few years, he had a laser-like focus on health care, financial reform and the economy. On foreign policy, he spoke to the world about improving America's relations overseas. That kind of focus, however, has largely disappeared. President Obama has delivered some important speeches, such as his address on inequality, but quickly moved on to other issues rather than follow through.   Throughout the battles over the budget, the president turned from one crisis to the next without stopping and really putting forth a clear vision and set of priorities in response to the austerity zeal of the GOP. He has allowed his opponents to define the agenda, as opposed to the White House. Even when Secretary of State John Kerry moved aggressively to put into place diplomatic solutions to nuclear threats, President Obama seemed to follow his lead rather than outline this as a priority in foreign affairs.  Obama would do well to stick to a few subjects, to articulate the direction he hopes to take the nation and move forward methodically to make sure they come to fruition.  Resolutions are easy to make but difficult to follow. In the world of politics, the stakes of sticking with those promises are big. Given the tremendous difficulties that this president has faced and the dire approval ratings he is seeing, it is time for President Obama to double down and make certain that he does everything possible to put himself in a position to strengthen his presidency, his party and his nation in his final years in the White House.

Why Trump the deal-maker came off looking incompetent,"A President who admires strongmen tried to strong-arm the Republicans who control the United States House of Representatives. Pass the repeal of Obamacare and replace it with Trumpcare, Donald Trump told the 247 Republicans, or else you'll be ousted in a primary. When that failed to move them sufficiently he added another threat: Vote with me or you'll never get another chance at health care reform. The Republicans gathered for an emotional pre-vote caucus in the basement of the Capitol. As they departed, many said it was one of the most impressive conferences they had ever attended. But when House Speaker Paul Ryan offered little more than a brief statement and dashed off without answering reporters' questions, the signs of defeat were apparent.  Having practiced his usual method of deal-making, Trump then walked away from the hard work of political negotiating. White House spokesman Sean Spicer, insisting there was no ""plan B,"" predicted victory. While Ryan tried to get his House in order, the President climbed into a big-rig tractor parked outside the White House, sounded the horn like an excited boy and pretended he was driving. (He hadn't looked so happy in weeks.) Despite all these expressions of confidence, the Republicans who run Washington never could come together behind Trumpcare. Hours before the vote, The Daily Beast reported that, according to officials in the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump's top adviser, Steve Bannon, wanted him to make a list of his House GOP enemies so they might be punished.  When this last tough-guy tactic failed, Trump and Ryan slammed on the brakes and canceled the showdown vote. CNN and other networks reported the debacle in real time and both men were left humiliated and diminished. No one should be surprised that Trump's first big legislative initiative collapsed in a cloud of chaos. Aside from the development of his enormous ego, nothing in Donald Trump's life experience prepared him to actually function as president of the United States.   This became evident during the presidential transition, when he proved incapable of bringing the country together and then, upon his inauguration, when he immediately began offering lies and distortions about everything from the size of the crowd at the inauguration to the claim that the recent election was marred by massive voter fraud. The most remarkable thing about the Trump presidency may be our expectation that he would be any different. Trump first demonstrated his penchant for distortion and deception as a young man when he bragged about his accomplishments before he had any. Despite four massive corporate bankruptcies, each involving complex enterprises that required real executive skills, Trump insisted he was a great business leader.  What he was, in fact, was a successful entrepreneur who led family-held companies that he could direct like a monarch.  He was THE BOSS and anyone who disagreed with him knew where to find the door.     The trouble for President Trump, who made repeal-and-replace of Obamacare one of his big campaign promises, is that he cannot fire anyone in Congress.  Indeed, only the voters can fire a member of the House of Representatives and if the latest polls are to be believed, very few of those voters liked Trumpcare. Perhaps it was the part of the bill that would push 24 million of them off the health insurance rolls that they didn't like. Or maybe it was the part of the law that eliminated all those coverage requirements for policies including pregnancy care, drug benefits and mental health coverage.  House members, who must seek re-election every two years, understood this and were far more afraid of facing angry constituents than dealing with a President whose approval rating is now 37%.        As bad as Trump's retreat on his bill seemed as it was occurring, it seems worse as the minutes and hours have passed and we can reflect on how the defeat contrasts with the Trump image. This is a man who celebrates himself as a dynamic winner of incomparable abilities. ""Only I can fix"" them, he said of America's problems during the campaign.  In his estimation, all those governors and legislators who ran against him in the primaries, were, like President Obama, losers and failures. Of course most of the others who sought the Republican nomination in 2016 were successful in government before they ran. And don't forget how that loser Obama managed to get his health care bill passed. What does it say about Trump that when he put himself on the line and tried to get his first piece of major legislation passed, he came up looking like an incompetent?   First, it says that Trump lacks an understanding of how the legislative system works and probably ignored those around him who do. Second, he lacks a leadership style suited to dealing with hundreds of members of Congress who are each powerful political figures in their own districts. Finally, and most importantly, we can see that he does not possess the temperament of presidents like Johnson, Reagan and Clinton who respected the process and loved it. The flimsy bill that Trump and Ryan put forward and the clumsy way they went about seeking votes suggest they lacked real conviction.  What happens next? If past is prologue, Trump will blame everyone but himself. Ryan should come in for a heap of recrimination, mostly from administration figures speaking to reporters under cover of anonymity.   Eventually, perhaps sooner than later -- and despite his protestations to the contrary -- Trump will try again. The trouble is that Congress has demonstrated that Trump's usual way of leading through intimidation won't work.  And he hasn't shown that he knows another way."
The 5th Circuit Court's insult to Obama,"There has never been any doubt that President Obama fully accepts the Supreme Court's authority to render a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.  Chief executives during our history, including President Andrew Jackson in the 1830s and President Harry Truman in the 1940s, have in fact challenged or threatened to challenge the court's right to command obedience to its understanding of the Constitution, but Obama certainly is not among them.  As a brilliant constitutional lawyer deeply devoted to the rule of law, he has nothing but respect for the critical function that judicial review performs in preserving the American system of constitutional government.  Efforts to divine a contrary theory in his remarks were strained at the outset and have grown only more untenable.     The ""unprecedented, extraordinary"" step he noted the justices would be taking if they were to overturn the Affordable Care Act was, of course, not the step of exercising judicial review, as the court has done ever since Marbury v. Madison in 1803, but the step of second-guessing congressional judgments about how best to regulate a vast segment of the national economy. No one in the world -- certainly none of the justices -- can have been surprised to learn that Obama believes his signature domestic achievement fully complies with the Constitution and ought to be upheld -- or that the Supreme Court has a decades-old tradition of treading lightly when major regulations of interstate commerce come before it.  After the president made that entirely clear Tuesday, some suggested that it would be best for presidents not to comment on cases pending before the Supreme Court even while the rest of the nation continues to debate the underlying constitutional issues.  I was among those who took that view while others suggested that, as the entire nation continues to discuss the constitutionality of a vital economic measure, artificially muzzling the nation's chief executive ill serves the purposes of open public debate on important issues.  That's something about which people can reasonably differ. But there's no reasonable basis for seeing in the president's comments either a challenge to the court's authority as an independent branch of government or a clumsy attempt to pressure it politically or to influence its deliberations.  This president knows as well as anyone how utterly implausible it would be to think that the justices might be swayed in their constitutional views by his brief remarks, which did little more than reiterate a core theme of the government's legal briefs (namely, the critical importance of strong judicial deference to the elected branches on complex matters of economic regulation like national health care policy).  This theme has received a full airing in media commentary, congressional hearings, legal scholarship and lower court judicial opinions.  Nobody could really believe that the president's candid expression of a view that everyone already attributed to him would move the judicial calculus even a micrometer.    The justices have spent months steeped in more than a hundred legal briefs, presided over one of the most dramatic oral arguments of the past century and are currently engaged in robust internal deliberations.  They also live in a world awash with op-eds, heated commentary and all the markers of fiercely divided public opinion.  These are men and women accustomed to dealing with politics.  They ordinarily approach their duties with the utmost seriousness and, we must hope, are exercising their very highest faculties of judgecraft and constitutional commitment in this case.   There was no disrespect in the president's entirely correct observation that precedent and historical practice alike would lead a suitably cautious court to uphold rather than overturn his signature first-term achievement in providing health insurance to millions of Americans. The fact that health care reform has represented a pressing issue for the nation over the course of a century would indeed make a decision to strike down the law all the more jarring. But the notion that the president's recognition of that fact somehow crossed the Rubicon in our separation of powers by seeking to diminish the court's independence is patently absurd.  That said, we have recently witnessed a shocking misuse of power in relation to these events.  But it came from the judiciary rather than the president.  Judge Jerry Smith of the 5th Circuit responded to the president's comments by ordering the Department of Justice to submit a three-page, single-spaced memo stating the administration's position on judicial authority to invalidate unconstitutional laws.  Attorney General Eric Holder filed that memo Thursday, reiterating the plain import of the president's remarks and stating that ""the power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute.""    Smith's gratuitous order is little more than a thinly concealed insult to the president, the Justice Department and the administration.  It constitutes a shocking departure from norms of judicial behavior.  While such partisan bickering might be expected from the minority leader of the Senate or from commentators like Rush Limbaugh, who drew upon Obama's remarks in yet another entry in their relentless attacks on the president, it is hardly to be expected of a federal judge.   As constitutional challenges to the Affordable Care Act have journeyed through the courts since the statute's 2010 passage, the country has engaged in a profound national conversation about the Constitution's import and meaning.  Although I remain unpersuaded by constitutional objections to the statute, I respect the efforts of many Americans to give voice to their convictions in constitutional terms.  This week's distortion and exaggeration only tarnish the earnestness of such efforts and threaten to undermine the genuine opportunities for constitutional dialogue and disagreement that sustain us as a nation.

The health care reality conservatives ignore,"For all the difficulties of the Affordable Care Act's rollout, Americans are more patient than you might think: A new poll shows a majority expressing optimism that the problems are going to be ironed out.  Not only that, a majority continues to support the law or think it didn't go far enough.  Nevertheless, the conservatives rooting for its demise have been expressing not just vindication, but triumph. ""We could be looking at the collapse of American liberalism,"" said columnist Charles Krauthammer. ""Liberalism is crumbling in front of our eyes,"" echoed Michele Bachmann. Yes indeed, a glitchy website and people moving from junk insurance to real insurance prove once and for all that government should have as little to do with health care as possible, and the entire liberal project lies in tatters. That's a little like proclaiming that your team will inevitably lose the World Series, then go bankrupt and disband because the other team scored a run in the first inning of Game 1. But the momentary political situation aside, conservatives still face a fundamental problem when they confront  America's health care system. Their ideology dictates only one solution to all health care problems, and that solution -- less government, more free market -- is exactly what gave us our dysfunctional health care system in the first place. Let's step back a moment to consider why we needed the Affordable Care Act and what it says about the health care market. The basic conservative position is that the more you let market forces operate, the better the outcome will be. ""More markets"" is the answer to everything:   Let people buy insurance across state lines. Make it virtually impossible to sue for medical malpractice. Create more health savings accounts. But where do you think the problems of America's health care system came from? It wasn't government that gave us nearly 50 million uninsured Americans and denials for pre-existing conditions. It wasn't government that gave us the yearly and lifetime caps on insurance coverage that have sent so many people into bankruptcy when they've faced a serious illness or accident. It wasn't government that gave us ""rescissions,"" where your insurance company cancels your policy if you get sick.  It wasn't government that gave us a system in which the gap between what we spend and what we get is so enormous. It was the free market. The conservatives who profess to love markets so dearly seem unable to grasp that the market for health care isn't like the market for shoes or cars. Other developed countries understand this. Every one of our peer nations has a system with more government control than ours, ranging from almost completely socialized systems like Great Britain's to ones like those in Switzerland and the Netherlands, which resemble Obamacare but with tighter regulation. We don't have to wonder whether a health care system built on capitalist profit-seeking is more efficient and less expensive than those in which the government exercises more control. There has been a test running for decades, with many developed countries doing it one way, and the United States doing it the other. The results couldn't be clearer. On almost any criterion you can come up with, the government-controlled systems work better. They cover everyone, while spending far less than we do. Their health outcomes are as good or better than ours. A recent Bloomberg News analysis rated America's as the world's 46th most efficient health system, right above Serbia and right below Iran. Among the developed countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the U.S. ranks first (by a mile) in health spending per capita, but 26th in life expectancy.  There are some, however, who love the American health care system. American doctors make far higher salaries than their counterparts in other countries. American insurance companies do very well. As a recent New York Times investigation revealed, makers of devices like artificial hips mark up their prices double, triple, or even more when they sell to American hospitals as they do when they sell the same devices to European hospitals. The same is true of a hundred other devices and procedures. Why? Because in Europe, Japan, and other places with highly regulated health care, government rules keep the costs low. In the American system, there are multiple points where companies do the rational thing: Extract as much money as possible from the system. That's why an MRI costs three times as much in the U.S. as it does in France or Holland. But people living under the oppression of those other governments' systems must hate them, right? Wrong. The Commonwealth Fund recently released a study of health systems in 10 developed countries around the world which included a survey of satisfaction. America's health system was the least popular, with only 25% of Americans saying it works well and the other 75% saying it should be fundamentally changed or completely rebuilt. The most popular was the most socialized, Great Britain's, with 63% saying it works well.  You may remember that the opening ceremonies of the 2012 summer Olympics in London included a tribute to the National Health Service, so proud are Britons of their health system.  Despite all the problems created by America's private health care market, we do have versions of big-government, socialized insurance.  They're called Medicare and Medicaid. They are far more efficient than private insurance, and Medicare recipients in particular love their coverage. It's no accident that in every election, Republicans -- who fought against the creation of Medicare and would love to privatize it -- try to pretend to voters that they're the program's greatest defenders. The champions of free-market capitalism decide they can't get elected without supporting a single-payer insurance program. In all their glee about the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act, most Republicans are barely bothering to offer an alternative, other than a return to the way things used to be. It isn't surprising, because to be brutally frank, they never much cared about the spectacular human suffering created by free-market health care. For decades, liberals have been working to devise policy solutions and create the political conditions for health care reform that would achieve secure, universal coverage. On the other hand, in the face of millions who can't get insurance because of pre-existing conditions and millions more who just can't afford it, the conservative response was always, ""Whatever."" The market spoke, and you lost. Too bad for you.  The Affordable Care Act can certainly be improved. But in health care -- to paraphrase Ronald Reagan -- the free market isn't the answer to our problems. It is the problem. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Repeal health care law? Forget about it,"On Tuesday, the Congressional Budget Office added another reason to drop the politics and get down to the hard work of health care reform.  The nonpartisan organization released a report that finds the cost of repealing the reform will balloon government deficits by $109 billion between 2013 and 2022.  The CBO's report reveals the practical hurdles to repeal and underscores a growing pattern in which the key stakeholders -- states, medical providers, businesses, insurers and consumer groups -- are moving beyond the partisan squabble to the no-nonsense work of building the market place of 2014, where everyone will be able to purchase affordable insurance regardless of pre-existing conditions.   Doctors, hospitals, insurers and employers are, of course, bargaining to improve their specific stakes. They harbor reservations and uncertainties, but their general approach is ""mend it, not end it.""  The medical providers welcome relief from the crushing burden of uncompensated care and from the immorality of leaving the ill without adequate care owing to patients' inability to pay.  Insurers look forward to new customers and to a new public conversation that spotlights the broader causes of high medical costs rather than blaming insurers alone.  Large employers are nervous about rising costs but are generally more concerned about moderating the rate of growth and ending a system that often shifts costs to them in the financial burden of caring for the uninsured. A series of developments reveals the growing gap between the new reality on the ground and the lingering efforts of those who want to refight battles and repeal the law that the Supreme Court declared constitutional in June. Texas Gov. Rick Perry called Medicaid -- the program for the indigent -- the ""Titanic"" because he didn't believe it was feasible or would prove seaworthy.  Meanwhile, private business checked their bottom line and readily saw the new opportunities.  Our nation's second-largest insurer, WellPoint, paid $4.9 billion in cash to purchase another insurance company, Amerigroup, to dramatically expand its ability to service the expanding number of people in Medicaid. Wall Street is doubling down on insurers who do Medicaid business because of their confidence in the Medicaid expansion. As repealers complain, the marketplace created 89 new accountable care organizations, which were formed in 40 states to deliver more cost-effective care to more than 1 million people by July 1.  With great fanfare, House Republicans held a hearing earlier this month to profile how health reform interferes with patient care. There's one problem: They are unable to feature the leading voices of patient care -- the American Medical Association and American Hospital Association -- because those organizations support reform as good for patients. And then, of course, we have the voters. Only about a fifth push for full repeal. And many Americans, including rank-and-file Republicans, support new protections against insurers who turn away customers with pre-existing conditions or terminate policies when the costs of care pass annual limits.  Even if Republicans won the White House and congressional majorities in November, the frustrating legislative trapdoors that slowed and nearly killed health reform in 2009 and 2010 will likely remain hurdles to repeal. The reluctance of stakeholders, states and voters will stir consternation, delay and deadlock. The growing talk among Republicans of what would replace ""repeal"" is an early indicator of the changes afoot. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently offered a dose of reality to calm repeal fever when he counseled that ""it's a lot harder to undo something than it is to stop it in the first place."" Mitt Romney's position may be the most revealing.  Against driving hailstorms from those favoring repeal, he has continued to support his reform in Massachusetts because he knows where stakeholders stand. While he won't force states to implement his or the national reforms (he says he'd like to repeal the Affordable Care Act), his continued support for the Massachusetts reform will make it very difficult for him to deny other states the same opportunity that President George W. Bush gave him.  Reform of America's health care system is under way, reconfiguring how care is provided and paid for. It is time to shift from symbolism and theatrics to the details of improving the transition that is occurring. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion"
Where's Hillary? Not in Charlotte,"Where's Hillary? Where did she go?  Don't bother looking for her this week on the podium of the Democratic National Convention. Don't try to catch a glimpse of her in the backrooms where the powerful gather or on the convention floor where delegates wave signs proclaiming their love for Obama or Clinton (the other Clinton; the husband).  No, while Democrats try to stoke the troops with passion for their party and excitement for Barack Obama's re-election, the most popular member of the Democratic Party, possibly the most popular major politician in America, will stay far away from the national spotlight, about 10,000 miles away.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is occupied with other matters, serious matters of state. No time for cheering or voter-rousing. She's keeping her distance from politics, and that might work out just fine in a few years. As Democrats started streaming to North Carolina, she jetted off to the middle of nowhere. Or, more precisely, to the Cook Islands in the Pacific. Look it up. It's far away.  By now, Hillary -- as everyone calls her unofficially (and we're speaking unofficially) -- has moved on in her busy Asian itinerary. As you read this, she may be in China, or in Timor-Leste, or perhaps Brunei. The official explanation is that she had important business and as a sitting secretary of state, she is supposed to stay above politics, above the partisan fray. Indeed, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said it is customary for the current secretary to avoid the political season, as she did in 2008.  Hillary, however, is not just any secretary of state. She is the woman who almost beat the current president for the nomination. She's the one millions hope will lead the ticket in 2016.  She is the one Democrat on everyone's mind this week even if she made it a point to move her operations to the other side of the world. Journalists will find it difficult to ask her opinion about the convention or ask the real question, the one people have not stopped asking in four years: Will she run for president in 2016?  The standard answer is that she has no interest in running again and looks forward to private life after Obama's first term. But few people believe she has made that decision. The reluctance to take her at her word stems partly from the stunning phenomenon of worldwide popularity that Hillary Clinton has become.  For every one of the past 10 years, Americans have ranked her the Most Admired Woman, ahead even of Oprah when she had her show. Hillary is probably among the most popular women in the history of the United States, having won the title 16 times, more than any other woman.  She consistently scores the highest approval ratings of any top member of the Obama administration, and she has developed an extraordinary level of personal rapport with the masses, with the millions who have never met her but have seen her evolve over the decades.  People feel an emotional connection after having witnessed the visible pain she endured during her husband's public cheating scandals. They watched her raise her chin, battle adversity and come out ahead. Everyone knows it has not been easy.  Liberated from campaigning, she has relaxed. She has become more spontaneous and genuine, leaving behind some of the calculated deliberateness of the politician. Hillary's most private moments seem to fill her admirers with vicarious joy. When images surface of her dancing or drinking a beer during a break from work in Colombia, they immediately go viral. As if people felt glad that she's happy.  The Internet parody ""Texts from Hillary"" became all the rage, as it purported to show the ubercompetent SecState whipping the world into line. In one image, President Obama, stretched out on a couch, sends a text, ""Hey Hil. Whatchu doing?"" Hillary, looking stylish in shades, with giant briefing books before her, texts back: ""Running the world.""  It's a joke, but it's funny because it reflects an image that has taken hold. Hillary seems to work harder than anyone. She has traveled to more countries -- 108 so far -- than any of her predecessors. She's always at it. And it always seems important. The mere mortals, the regular politicians, are out campaigning, telling half-truths and slinging mud. Hillary's busy, working to keep the world running.  As secretary of state, she is in a perfect position to work on issues that are much less controversial than domestic dilemmas. She doesn't need to talk about tax increases, health care reform or the deficit. She doesn't have to spar with the Republicans and look petty or nasty in the process.  It makes her look superior to the others. It puts her in great shape for 2016, when she will be 69, not too old to run for president.  Hillary first electrified activists back in 1995, when she declared in her famous Beijing speech ""it is no longer acceptable to discuss women's rights as separate from human rights."" And she has never let up on her efforts on behalf of women. But men, too, even the most rugged (even Republicans) have come to respect her.    
Back in 2010, when a Rolling Stone reporter quoted senior military men in Afghanistan disparaging the Obama administration, he revealed that, ""Only Hillary Clinton receives good reviews.""  And she has not stopped getting great reviews. Staying out of the political mud-pit, she is the subject of popularity polls, breathless speculation and gushing profiles, like a recent cover story -- complete with photo spread -- in Conde Nast Traveler. In addition to the glamor and the competence, the writer revealed ""one very intimate detail that most people still don't know about Hillary Clinton."" The secret? ""She does not sweat. Literally. She does not even glow. No matter how high the heat, not a drop nor a drip nor a bead ...""  The polls show voters want Hillary to run again. In Iowa, a look at presidential preferences showed Hillary beating Vice President Biden 60 to 18. No one else reached 5%. In New York, voters want Hillary to run even more than they want their very popular governor to do so.  So, while the Democrats shout themselves hoarse in Charlotte, Hillary will be far away, busy with affairs of state. But don't be so sure her absence means she's not interested in politics.  Like everyone in Charlotte, she too is probably pondering what Hillary will do in 2016. She may be absent, out of sight. But staying away only makes the Democrats' heart grow fonder.

Myths about Obamacare,"The Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, was passed into law more than three years ago, but it really doesn't go into effect until next year. That's when the major changes, including the health insurance exchanges ramp up and the Medicaid expansion occurs. Because there has been such a long time between when things started and now, there are plenty of misconceptions about what's happened, what's going on, and what will occur. For instance, just a month ago, a poll found that 4 in 10 Americans were unsure about whether Obamacare still existed. About a quarter didn't know or didn't answer. An additional 7% thought that the Supreme Court had overturned it last year. Another 12% thought that it had been repealed by Congress and is no longer a law. Those that still know Obamacare is around remain divided on how they feel about it. A more recent poll from CNN found that only 43% of the public ""supports the health care law."" This might lead you to think that most of the country wants it repealed. But, as with so many things related to health care reform, there's more than meets the eye here. A full 16% of Americans, about a third of those who ""oppose the health care law,"" do so because it's not liberal enough. It's important to remember that in many ways Obamacare was a ""centrist"" solution. Many don't like to hear that, believing that it's socialism-writ-large, but a sizeable chunk of America supported something like Medicare-for-all, a single-payer solution more like what Canadians, or our elderly, enjoy. Many of them still think that's a better choice for health care reform. In other words, it might be fairer to say that 59% of Americans support a system that is as liberal or more liberal than Obamacare, while 35% don't. That's a much different interpretation than what many are repeating. Regardless, it's clear that many are still unclear about what's going on with the law or how they feel about it. It's not surprising, therefore, that the Obama administration is gearing up for another big push to sell its brand of reform to the American people. This is a critical time for the law. For better or worse, the Republican Party, for the most part, stands in total opposition to Obamacare. Many have called the law a ""train wreck"" waiting to happen, and they believe that letting the law fail, spectacularly, is the quickest way to get rid of that. Because of this, few, if any, opponents of the law are willing to make any concessions or changes to it at all. This is a relatively new thing when it comes to major legislation. Past laws on this scale, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, Medicare, and Social Security were amended and changed years and even months after being passed. That's incredibly unlikely to happen with respect to Obamacare.  Moreover, many are doing all they can actively to prevent the law from moving forward. About half of states have refused to partake in the Medicaid expansion, meaning that the majority of the poorest among us will not get Medicaid next year as the law originally planned. Many states are also dragging their feet with respect to the insurance exchanges, hoping that if the federal government fails to get things going in time, Americans will see that the law is unsuccessful. Widespread belief in this might help Republicans increase their electoral power to the point that they can demand repeal. This strategy could backfire, though. California, one of the states most thoroughly embracing Obamacare, recently had its rates published for its insurance exchange. The cost of insurance premiums came in significantly below what had been projected.  Back in 2009, projections for a ""silver"" plan for a 40 year old were $5,200-5,400 a year. Last week, though, California announced that the most affordable ""silver"" plan would cost just over $3,300 a year. That is, of course, the cost without subsidies. For the many Americans who make less than 400% of the poverty line, the cost to them will be even less. Some will claim that this is still a rate increase for some. That's likely true. There is almost no policy that works out perfectly for everyone. It's likely that some very young, healthy people will spend more on their insurance now for the chance to have it cheaper -- and guaranteed -- later. There are also some who will chafe at having to buy insurance at all.  But the gambit of those opposing Obamacare seems to be a full throated and all-out-effort to show that Obamacare doesn't work. The danger, though, is that it might. The jury is still out, of course. But it's important to recognize that full-out opposition to reform like this is somewhat novel in American politics. No one knows what such a strategy will bring in the long run. Many thought passing the Affordable Care Act would be President Obama's ""Waterloo.""  It wasn't. In fact, some have argued that the flat out refusal to negotiate in the law's passage cost opponents the chance to get a final product more to their liking. Things are shaping up similarly now. If, a year from now, it appears that exchanges are working out in states that embraced them, and that the Medicaid expansion is succeeding in states that allowed it, then it may turn out that refusing to bend may have instead caused the opposition to break.

Health care's arc of history: GOP's remarkable move to the right,"In 1965, 13 Senate and 70 House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the Social Security Amendments that created Medicare and Medicaid. Many Republicans in the House and Senate took this vote kicking and screaming, but in the end, they joined the Democratic majority to create the largest expansion of government health care coverage in American history until the Affordable Care Act. Thursday, after deliberating in the dark of Senate office buildings, Republicans in the upper chamber, led by Mitch McConnell, signaled they will join their House counterparts in dismantling the Affordable Care Act -- thereby stripping away health care coverage for millions of Americans. This will not be an easy vote for the 20 Republican senators whose states have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, and where the changes brought about by the program are quite popular. There are nine Republican senators running for re-election in 2020 whose states have expanded the program. McConnell is telling these Republicans to fall on their partisan sword.  Although the Senate version of the bill will offer some slight modifications to soften the blow, such as keeping subsidies for individual coverage of low-income Americans, overall it looks similar and, in some respects, it is even tougher. It cuts deeply into Medicaid coverage, eliminates crucial taxes and gets rid of the vital individual mandate essential to making this insurance system work and keeping it affordable.  The Senate proposal delays the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion but then makes much deeper cuts than the House. President Donald Trump might have described the House bill as ""mean,"" but Senate Republicans seem to be just fine traveling along the same path.  The Senate version of repealing the Affordable Care Act is a powerful reminder of just how much the Republican Party has changed since the 1960s as legislators in the House and Senate have shifted far to the right.  Republicans were divided in 1960s To be sure, back in 1965 there were many conservative Republicans who opposed Medicare. Ronald Reagan spun a record that warned that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson's Medicare proposal, which provided hospital insurance to the elderly paid for by Social Security taxes, was an opening wedge to socialism.  Sen. Barry Goldwater made his opposition to Medicare a key theme in his presidential campaign against Johnson. ""Having given our pensioners their medical care in kind, why not food baskets, why not public housing accommodations, why not vacation resorts, why not a ration of cigarettes for those who smoke and beer for those who drink?"" Goldwater asked.  Republicans only proposed their alternatives to Medicare after the landslide Democratic victories in 1964 made it inevitable that some version of the bill was going to pass. Even in the final vote on the conference committee report, 68 House and 17 Senate Republicans voted against the legislation.  But other Republicans made a different choice. Faced with the fact that elderly Americans struggled to afford basic health insurance coverage, liberal Republicans such as New York's Jacob Javits had been a driving force in the push for federal health care coverage.  While many Republicans opposed the administration's Medicare proposal, they did support an alternative in the House, sponsored by ranking Ways and Means Committee Republican John Byrnes, that provided  insurance to cover the cost of doctors supported by government funds and contributions from beneficiaries. Many experts believed this plan was actually more generous than the administration's. Even the most conservative wing of the Republican Party pushed for health care for the poor, administered by the states in cooperation with the federal government, which today we know of as Medicaid.   Liberals and moderates gone British novelist L.P. Hartley wrote, ""The past is a foreign country,"" and that seems especially true of the Republican Party in the 1960s, given its transformation to what we see today. Liberals and moderates have vanished from the GOP conferences in the House and Senate. Conservative Republicans slowly took over most of the key leadership positions and committee chairs, and there have been fewer and fewer dissenting votes on roll call votes that lean to the right.    In 2010, the tea party was born and institutionalized this rightward drift among Republicans in the House. Members aligned with the tea party formed the Freedom Caucus in 2015, and they have been a force with which to reckon. Under the leadership of Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, they have created a powerful organizational mechanism within the House that refuses to budge on key issues and that resists the pressure to compromise on core principles. The caucus is willing to go to extremes to pursue its objectives (threatening, for instance, to send the nation into default over disputes about spending) and it has taken down leaders, such as Speaker John Boehner, who opposed it.  For all the talk about McConnell being the master legislator, it looks like his ultimate solution with health care has been to concede to the House plan, tinkering around the edges rather than doing anything to really satisfy the concerns of the Republicans from states where the Medicaid expansion under the ACA and regulations such as the coverage of pre-existing problems remain extremely popular.  After emerging from their secret meetings, McConnell is giving Republicans a stark choice -- vote for the draconian changes passed by the House or get nothing at all. McConnell's decision is evidence that the Freedom Caucus rules the roost on Capitol Hill. The political problem for Republicans is that the current versions of the health care reform are incredibly unpopular, according to almost every poll. Once the possible effects of the bill are felt, it is likely the anger toward the legislation could intensify, causing serious problems in the 2018 midterm elections and in the next presidential election.  A vote in favor of this health care bill could easily alienate Republican voters who worry about the extremism in the party, and the chaos in the Oval Office, but have remained loyal to their party. Whether Democrats can take advantage of the fallout, that's a different question, one that remains unclear after this week's special election in Georgia. And it is also possible that other issues such as the economy will overwhelm the anger about the health care vote.  The House and Senate versions of health care reform reveal a Republican Party that is willing to go very far to gut the legacies of the New Deal and Great Society as well as President Barack Obama's domestic agenda. This will be a defining vote for the GOP that puts the party on record for where it stands on protecting Americans from the vicissitudes of health care markets.  For all the attention paid to Trump, his tweets and the controversy over Russia, the reality is that in today's Washington the real story is the power of the Freedom Caucus."
CBO report adds to Mike Pence's woes,"The Congressional Budget Office report showing that 24 million more Americans will be uninsured by 2026 under the Republican health care bill is a major blow for Vice President Mike Pence who has been making the rounds to assure Republicans that this is a plan worth backing. The fallout over the report reveals the kind of political pitfalls that Pence is increasingly facing as he emerges as one of the most important figures in the administration. The vice president must deal with the baggage from the administration's actions and President Trump's statements. Over the past few weeks, Pence has been playing a number of important roles inside the administration. The most important is that he has become a bridge to the conservatives on Capitol Hill, trying to calm nerves over bills like the health care reform.  In this role, Pence is facing some of the challenge that then-Vice President Walter Mondale confronted when he had to sell President Jimmy Carter's more controversial ideas, like energy conservation and fiscal austerity, to a Democratic Congress that was hoping for another Great Society, not some kind of middle way.  Mondale, previously a senator from Minnesota who had impeccable liberal credentials with his former colleagues in Congress, worked hard to persuade Democrats that Carter, despite his unorthodox ways, still was on the same political page. His efforts were only of middling success as Carter ultimately proved to be unpopular with Democrats despite Mondale's efforts. Pence has a better chance of succeeding since, generally, Trump is not doing much to depart from the party agenda, unlike the way that Carter did with the Democrats. This is a debate over how conservative to be in going after the Affordable Care Act, not whether to stick to the political middle.  Now with the CBO report, Pence will be needed more than ever. Not only does he need to sell the conservatives that this not ""Obamacare Lite"" but a serious move in the right direction toward market-based health care. He also needs to persuade moderates that this bill is still worth the political risks that could result from rolling back health care coverage for millions of people. If Pence can pull this off he will emerge from this battle as a real power player within the White House. The only thing that has insulated President Trump thus far from the ongoing attacks by Democrats, the relentless investigations from the news media, and the growing scrutiny of the courts is the Republican Congress.  President Trump, the divider, is depending on the fact that partisanship will hold and that in the end the Republican Congress will not abandon him or, even worse, turn against him. Until that happens it will be very difficult for any Democrat to make headway against this White House. So, if the vice president can get them through this challenging moment with an actual piece of legislation and without an open right-wing revolt, the President will keep turning to him as his point man on the Hill.  Pence has also become an important voice on foreign policy, The president sent him to Europe to help ease concerns among U.S. allies about Trump's commitment to NATO. Pence is taking a lead role in deliberations with Japan.  The vice president is also being used as the ""clean-up man in chief."" After many of the President's more controversial statements and decisions, Pence has stepped in to try to smooth things over. When Trump attacked the ""so-called"" judge who halted his first executive order on immigrations, Pence took to the airwaves to justify the attack. Pence tweeted out that the administration joined the ""Jewish people"" on Holocaust Remembrance Day after the White House came under fire for having rejected the State Department draft of a statement that mentioned Jews. Pence has also been important in the appointment process. A number of people who Pence considered allies are now in the administration, including former Indiana Sen. Dan Coats, who the Senate confirmed as director of national intelligence, and Marc Short, one of Pence's former aides who has been named legislative affairs director for the President.  Pence is clearly looking to solidify his credentials not just to have greater standing in this White House but also to keep making the case that he is one of the most promising prospects as a Republican presidential candidate for future elections.  His commitment to the right is already well-established. What being vice president offers Pence is the ability to show that he can govern and that he can be a conservative leader with polish. The biggest threat for Pence is that the bigger his role becomes the more he will suffer from the baggage of the current administration. Besides the tensions over health care there are the scandals. With the Russiagate investigation looming large over the White House, as steady drips of information keep raising questions about what happened in the 2016 election, Pence has to beware the possibility of becoming part of a historic political scandal.    If things go south for Trump through scandal, failed legislation, or diminishing approval ratings among Republicans, Pence will be seen as part of the problem as well. He would do well to remember the fate suffered by Walter Mondale, who could never overcome Carter's shadow when he ran in 1984. Clearly, Pence is willing to take this risk as was evident when he first signed up for this job last summer. In the coming days, he will have to show that he can live up to this difficult challenge as he tries to shore up the president's support amid the furor over health care."
A different reason to vote for Trump,"House Republicans have had a tough decade.  Many of us elected in 2010, 2012 and 2014 went to Washington to challenge President Obama's big-government, progressive agenda that was sending our country down the wrong track, driving up debt, and imposing growth-choking, Washington-knows-best regulations on our health care, financial services, energy and other industries.     Although President Obama and congressional liberals blocked many of our efforts, we have enacted critical opioid, infrastructure, human trafficking and veterans legislation.  And while the Obama agenda has not been stopped, it has been slowed.  In the past 5½ years, congressional Republicans blocked, among other things:   an additional $850 billion in deficit spending; income tax increases on 99% of the American people; the closing of the Guantanamo Bay terrorist detention center; and a job-killing carbon tax.   We've also exposed agencies and high-ranking officials who violated fundamental precepts of public service.  We've put bills on the President's desk to repeal Obamacare and block implementation of onerous EPA rules.  And the Senate has exercised its constitutional prerogative to decline consideration of the Supreme Court nominee of a President who has willfully overstepped his constitutional limits.   A platform for the future Another important thing we have done is to develop a first-of-its-kind platform: A Better Way.   If implemented, A Better Way would not only restore American leadership in the world, it would generate a true economic expansion that would lift wages, increase job opportunities and generate revenues that will help us keep the commitments we've made to our seniors and veterans.    But our proposals for health care, tax and regulatory reform, strengthening security and generating upward mobility will only become reality if someone in the White House signs our legislation.  That is the fulcrum on which we sit.  We simply cannot afford another four years of sputtering zero to 2% economic growth.  That is the consequence if A Better Way is not enacted into law.  Hillary Clinton's status quo, big-government policies will only lead to more debt, doubt and decline.   While I appreciate the concerns I hear from some constituents and fellow members about the choices the American people face this November, I encourage everyone to consider something that has been missing in this debate.  It actually concerns one of the planks in our Better Way platform, and that has to do with the people with which I serve -- the members of the United States Congress.    In A Better Way, we describe how Congress can reclaim its constitutional responsibilities.  Those responsibilities go to the heart of the notion of self-rule.  Our Founders recognized that in our country, the people are the sovereign.  The people exercise that sovereignty through elected representatives, who in turn enact laws to which the people are subject.  If the people do not consent to those laws, they can change their representatives.   Regulatory superstate Our regulatory, administrative superstate, however, has replaced the sovereignty of the American people with the sovereignty of unelected and unaccountable Washington bureaucrats.  While the American people can replace the members of Congress, they cannot replace the unelected bureaucrats who have promulgated 600 major rules over the last seven years that will have an estimated cost of billions to implement.  Those rules are among the man-made headwinds that are strangling economic growth, keeping wages stagnant and forcing jobs overseas.  When you couple the regulatory leviathan with our broken appropriations process, where Congress gets cornered into take-it-or-leave-it omnibus spending bills that grotesquely limit its spending power, the legislative branch today exercises far less authority than the Constitution grants to it.    But now the good news.  Our historic Better Way platform puts us on offense.  This is fitting, because we, the people's representatives, are the ones who should be setting the nation's policy agenda.  It is in Congress where government of, by and for the people happens.   What then, of the Presidential election?  The simple fact is that only one of the candidates will sign our proposals.  Indeed, Donald Trump has committed to signing the REINS Act, which requires congressional approval before major rules and regulations become effective. Significantly, the REINS Act represents the most far-reaching restoration of congressional constitutional authority in history.    Donald Trump is following our lead on other matters as well. For example, his tax plan has evolved to conform more closely to our tax plan in the Better Way.    Our three branches of government are supposed to be independent and separate.  That means, for example that if a Republican were in the White House, a Republican Congress would still be free to exercise its own, independent constitutional role.  And there should be a healthy tension between the branches.    I would expect such with a Republican Congress and a Trump administration.  Unlike the manner in which congressional Democrats have circled the wagons to defend President Obama's unconstitutional overreach and Clinton's email debacle, Benghazi lies and failed tenure at the State Department, I fully expect to see a Republican Congress hold a President Trump accountable.   We have already seen, for example, members of our party disagree with Trump when he expresses opinions that are inconsistent with their own.  Holding President Trump accountable  Holding a President Trump accountable includes ensuring he keeps the commitments he has made to conservatives, especially regarding nominations to the Supreme Court.  Who knows, as we conduct such oversight, it is possible our Democratic colleagues may finally understand that a large part of the past six years of GOP House control has not been about like or dislike of President Obama, but about his failed policies and the protection of institutional, constitutional prerogatives of the United States Congress. And while a Trump administration will be subject to checks and balances from a Republican Congress, I expect a President Trump to exercise the executive branch's checks and balances as well.   It would be great to see Trump help Congress find spending discipline by forcing Congress to abandon its bipartisan, spend-by-omnibus tradition.  He should veto any of these thousand-page, trillion-dollar bills that reach his desk.  In doing so, he would be following through on President Reagan's 1988 admonition that ""Congress shouldn't send another one of these"" to the President.  President Reagan never made good on his veto threat for such bills; President Trump should. He should accompany that veto with a demand that Congress send him a two-week continuing resolution to fund the government temporarily, during which time Congress should work round the clock to get individual appropriations bills to his desk.  None of this happens, however, if Hillary Clinton is President.  With Donald Trump, you have someone who has already pledged to sign transformative legislation to restore congressional oversight, has embraced tax reform and health care reform proposals similar to those in A Better Way and pledged to support conservative nominees to the Supreme Court.   Should he not follow through on these commitments, Congress will exercise stringent oversight.  In other words, a Trump administration offers a rare opportunity for a resurgent legislative branch. Ours is a unique moment in history.  It is time for Congress to step up and into the role the Founders envisioned for the branch closest to the people.  That makes this coming Election Day a date with destiny we should embrace."
GOP's Obama obsession will lose it the election,"A month ago, when Mitt Romney addressed the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials during its annual conference in Orlando, Florida, many thought he was on a path to adopting a more nuanced tone on immigration and coming up with an aggressive strategy to woo Latino voters to his side.  Instead, he lately seems to have adopted U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann's messaging strategy, using a version of the Minnesotan's line from the 2008 campaign when she went on a rant about the views of then-Sen. Barack Obama and his wife being ""very anti-American."" Romney is not making it easier for Latinos to support him. In fact, the strategy will continue alienating this critical demographic group, along with independents and women.  We heard former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, one of Romney's top surrogates, use similar language on Tuesday. ""I wish this president would learn how to be an American,"" he said. Granted, he apologized for it later that day, but the subtext is still there. Romney himself is using a version of the line when he says that Obama's way of doing things seems ""foreign."" To many voters, that is code for ""un-American."" Repeat offender Rush Limbaugh has also been making headlines. On Monday he declared, ""I think it can now be said without equivocation"" that Obama ""hates this country."" And Republicans don't seem to be in a hurry to admonish him or distance themselves from those statements. Romney has not responded. To be clear, as a Democrat, I am not surprised or complaining that the GOP is resorting to such low levels. As for House Speaker Tip O'Neill was fond of saying, ""Politics ain't beanbag.""  As a political strategist, however, I find this new tactic reckless and dangerous for a political party that needs to broaden its base of support to win -- among independents, women and especially Latinos. This kind of language will do the opposite.  As an American Latina born in Colombia, I recoiled at this language, the same way I did in 2008 when Bachmann used it. It reminds me -- and I suspect it reminds many other Latinos in this country -- of the lengths to which many in this Republican Party have gone to marginalize those who represent the new and changing demographics in the United States.  Given that experts say Romney needs at least 40% of the Latino vote to win, this is an odd strategy for someone who enjoys Latino support in the low 20s. Contrast that to the effort going on in the Obama campaign to continue speaking to Latinos about the issues they care most about.  For example, I recently moderated a chat between first lady Michelle Obama and Latina moms from Mamiverse.com, a website for bilingual/English-dominant Latina moms.  It was a masterful political stroke by the Obama campaign. In half an hour, through this historic live chat, they demonstrated they understood just how important the voices of Latina mothers were going to be this election cycle and how critical that would be to Obama's re-election in this very tight race.  Obama won 67% of the Latino vote in 2008. A few months ago, I would have said it would be a big challenge for him to repeat those numbers, especially given some disappointment among Latinos about the president's not being able to deliver on immigration reform, as well as his record on deportations. But he is now on track to gain the same amount, if not more, of the Latino vote.  This week, Latino Decisions released a poll that gives Obama 70% of the Latino vote to Romney's 22%, the highest support the president has enjoyed from the Latino community to date. If those numbers hold, it will be very hard for Romney to win the election. This jump in support is a clear sign that the Obama campaign is doing a much more aggressive job of reminding Latino voters what this president has done to help Latino children and families get ahead: -- Health care reform gives 9 million Latinos and millions of Hispanic children with pre-existing conditions life-saving coverage. -- The Recovery Act has kept 1.9 million Latinos out of poverty, and the president's actions to create 4.5 million jobs include millions of new jobs for Latinos. -- Obama has passed 18 tax cuts for small businesses that benefit hundreds of thousands Latino entrepreneurs. -- Obama's support for Pell Grants gives 150,000 additional Hispanic students the chance to go to college. -- A $5 billion investment in the Head Start program benefits hundreds of thousands of Latino children who are more than one-third of Head Start participants. -- Extensions of the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit and unemployment benefits help 5.4 million Latino families, including 11.3 million Latino children and nearly 1 million Hispanics who didn't lose their unemployment benefits. -- And facing the ""party of 'no'"" on immigration, Obama has given temporary relief to almost 1 million ""dreamers"" -- undocumented kids who came here through no fault of their own and know no other country to call their own. They will be able to study or join the military without the threat of deportation. But Obama is getting some help from the GOP as well.  The Romney campaign's attacks on Obama as being less than all-American and ""foreign"" will bring to mind everything the GOP has said and done in the past to make Latinos feel unwelcome in their own country. For example, it will bring vivid memories of Kris Kobach, architect of the harsh Arizona SB1070 law, Romney's own ""self-deportation"" comments that won him the not-so-honorary title of being the most right-wing GOP presidential candidate on immigration, U.S. Rep. Steve King's remarks comparing immigrants to dogs and GOP Kansas State Rep. Virgil Peck's comments on fixing immigration by shooting immigrants from helicopters like feral pigs.  What's worse for the GOP is that not one national GOP leader has strongly condemned such voices. Some Republicans now, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, warn their own party members they must change their tune. Will these elected officials and party elders now warn their party about the danger of taking Bachmann's lead on messaging in this new line of attack against Obama? They should.  But Democrats probably won't lose any sleep if they don't. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion"
There's not enough 'care' in Tom Price's Obamacare alternative,"You might remember President-elect Donald Trump telling us that he'd like to keep some parts of Obamacare. That was two weeks ago. With his announcement Tuesday that Rep. Tom Price,  R-Georgia, will be his pick for Health and Human Services secretary, any type of preservation is highly unlikely. Price is one of the law's archenemies.  Seven years ago, during the heat of committee debates over the ACA, Price delivered a blistering speech condemning Democrats for an unwillingness to negotiate with him and other Republicans amid their harried push to get the Affordable Care Act through Congress.  Price didn't have a fully articulated alternative back then, but he knew what he didn't like about Obamacare. ""What you all are planning is to increase drastically the intrusion of the federal government into the practice of medicine and the care of patients,"" he said.  Of course Price was right. But we needed that ""intrusion"" of the federal government due to the crisis precipitated by the failures of medical professionals, the health care industry and the insurance industry to get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who had no access to care. Individual clinicians and hospitals may not be public utilities, but the system as a whole requires oversight to make sure it serves that function.    Obamacare and its Medicaid expansion are by no means elegant solutions, but they get the job done for tens of millions of Americans who didn't have coverage before, and offer important new protections for everyone else.  Price didn't just sit and fester over the years. He's got a plan now  But it's not written with the uninsured and the poor at the forefront. No, the driving concept behind Price's Empowering Patients First Act is protecting the choices of patients who have money. If you have the money to shop around, you'll be able to choose from a broad national market of insurance plans. There's no mandate to buy insurance at all, unlike Obamacare, and if you do buy insurance, you can pick from a threadbare plan that's cheaper because it excludes large categories of care -- like maternity care, reproductive care, or rehabilitation, for example. Obamacare required holistic health insurance covering all the major categories of events that we know can happen to anyone.  Price is also looking out for any well-to-do patients on Medicare who would like to be able to use Medicare dollars to offset more expensive fees from doctors and clinics who don't participate in Medicare. This rule change alone would rock health care by encouraging an exodus of providers out of Medicare's core cost-containment bargain: to treat Medicare patients, providers have always had to agree to take whatever reimbursement Medicare offers for the privilege of serving its beneficiaries. What about coverage for pre-existing conditions? Trump told ""60 Minutes"" and the Wall Street Journal he really liked that aspect of Obamacare, but for Price, your pre-existing condition isn't a priority. Price's plan will allow sick patients to stay in the regular market so long as they can keep paying their premiums. If a patient gets so sick she can't work to pay her premiums, insurers can jack up her rates 150%. If she becomes too poor to afford that, then she is relegated to high risk pools that will vary in quality state by state. These are small markets that need federal subsidies to work, and those subsidies are capped. If the high risk pools fill up, using up all its funds, then new patients simply can't enroll.  Suddenly, ""Empowering Patients"" begins to look a lot more like ""Empowering Insurance Companies."" Indeed, insurers can charge what they like for the one pre-existing condition we all may be so fortunate to develop: old age. As you get into the age brackets where you're more likely to need health care, you'll pay whatever insurers think the market can bear. Price wants our health care access to depend on how much competition we can foster between insurance companies to get new customers. In other highly regulated markets, like the airline industry, that concept isn't working out too well. Your only protection against those extra costs will be a capped tax deduction.  In contrast to Price's efforts to empower insurance executives, I think Obamacare erred in large part by not regulating insurance companies even more tightly (the law could have forced them to participate in the exchanges to stay in business at all, for example). Price's law even acknowledges some insurance plans will have to come with an asterisk and a warning. ""This policy may be less expensive than others because it is not subject to all of the insurance laws and regulations"" of your home state, shoppers are told, and ""this policy is not subject to all of the consumer protection laws or restrictions on rate changes"" of your home state. But all the skimpy plans Price could potentially offer would still be better than the void we had before Obamacare. It's my sincere hope that we won't see a repetition of the errors Democrats made while crafting the Affordable Care Act. Having experienced the other side of a legislative fiat, I hope that an HHS Secretary Price will bring Democrats to the table as he participates in crafting legislation behind the scenes with congressional Republicans. And everyone in Congress needs to keep in mind that the health care industry, particularly clinicians and hospitals, can only endure so much radical change within a short period.  It certainly does no good if Republicans implement a whole new health care reform that will only be wiped away in a few years if the other party takes charge. To that end, the ideal course of action is revising Obamacare to inject more of the freedom and choice Republicans prioritize, both for patients and providers, while preserving and strengthening the law's requirements that insurance companies offer holistic coverage to everyone. But our toxic politics won't allow for such sensible, professional legislating.  The best we can hope for from Price and his cohort are policies that manage to achieve the same ends in markedly different ways. I live in Price's district of northern Atlanta suburbs. The value of these suburbs as places to live comes not from their being 70% white. The value of Atlanta's suburbs comes entirely from their proximity to a more cosmopolitan urban center. We have to think of health care the same way, it can't work just for the rich.  Indeed if anyone in Price's district has a serious enough injury, they'll go to a publicly funded hospital on the south side of downtown Atlanta, where the demographics are quite different. Price knows it well. Besides founding a private orthopedic practice that is now the largest in the state, he also spent time training orthopedic residents at Grady Memorial Hospital, the region's safety net. Hospitals like Grady do the work the private hospitals up north don't want to do. Grady would be a stronger institution if Georgia had expanded Medicaid as Obamacare intended, but Price even calls for taking that option away from other states who want to continue using the expansion.  I don't know what Price experienced in his 25 years of medical practice that ever convinced him the average patient knows their future health care risks so well that saving money by shopping for skimpy plans is an important social good. I don't know why Price doesn't recognize the patients he once treated at Grady have enough struggles without worrying about how they're going to pay for health care. And I will never understand a fellow physician who's ever treated a gay or lesbian patient in distress who doesn't think everyone deserves to have a spouse by their side.  Price is a smart man, and he's put something on the table that's better than nothing, but we need far more. So, I hope he'll heed his own cries from seven years ago and negotiate with the other side."
"Obama is responsible for VA mess, but it may not be entirely his fault","Laying the blame for Veterans Administration failures at the feet of a man who pledged, six long years ago, to fix those problems is inviting.   During his 2008 White House transition, president-in-waiting Barack Obama promised to ""make the VA a leader of national health care reform so that veterans get the best care possible.""  In his own eyes at least, this President remains unstained by that failure. Shame remains unknown to this unnecessarily confident man.  Now, Obama not only tells us he is shocked to find that the crisis he has ignored is still there, he also insists, ""I will not tolerate it.""  If you can't fix the problem, of course, fix the politics. ""No-Drama Obama"" often pretends to share our anger to defuse it. His performance art, however, has grown obvious and condescending.  When he throws vacant words like candy to the masses, he only fuels our anger. Still, as satisfying as it might be, we shouldn't assign blame entirely to our commander in chief. For decades, Democrats, Republicans and even veterans -- including Gen. Eric Shinseki, a man of unquestionable commitment and proven leadership skills -- have tried to reform the VA's endless bureaucracy. At best, some have transformed the terrible to the merely awful. At worst, they have all failed wretchedly. Perhaps the problem is neither a lack of will or brains, nor a shortage of effort or good intentions. Perhaps they have not reformed the VA because it cannot be reformed. Even the most devoted instructor can't teach a hammerlike old bureaucracy to be anything but the dull, blunt instrument it is.   When the modern VA arose, as veterans came home from World War II, health care was simpler. We were a decade from pacemakers, two from hip replacements and balloon catheters, three from the miracle of an MRI.   Medicare had not been imagined, much less genomic testing, treatments for traumatic brain injuries and cures for half of all cancer patients.  Since then, caring for human health, like everything else in our lives, has become infinitely more complex. Today, our health care needs are intimate, intricate and intensely personal.  Imagine, however, that your health care was managed and delivered by a machine, an old factorylike mechanism composed, not of cogs and gears and smokestacks, but of bureaucrats, regulations and mountainous paper work.   Today's Veterans Administration, with 300,000 employees, is exactly such an industrial-age contraption. It's the second largest bureaucracy in our federal government. The VA is a glorified assembly line that excels at enforcing standardization, not delivering compassion, innovation, or personalized service.  It is built to dispense soul-crushing conformity.   Confronted with providing services that require originality, adaptation and sensitivity, the VA is lost. On what form does a bureaucracy measure compassion, originality, or the respect a veteran has earned?  And the worse the VA bureaucracy performs, the angrier all of us become -- and we demand even more regulatory government action. The leviathan that is the VA grows larger as bloat is piled upon excess.  In a wonderful new book, ""The Fourth Revolution: The Global Race to Reinvent the State,"" authors John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge note that enlarging the bureaucratic inadequacies of the modern industrial state are unlikely to improve it.   Instead, they found that fixing our government's bloated bureaucracy with even ""more state"" inevitably leads to failure on an apocalyptic level: ""Ninety-four percent of federal IT projects over the past ten years have failed -- more than half were delayed or over budget and 41.4 percent failed completely.""  They note that, ""The Pentagon spent over $3 billion on two health-care systems that never worked properly."" The VA is government-run health care, financed by government, and delivered through government-run hospitals. Liberal collectors of old social antiquities like Paul Krugman cannot let go of it. Krugman confesses, ""Yes, this is 'socialized medicine.' ... But it works, and suggests what it will take to solve the troubles of U.S. health care more broadly.""  Document: VA audit report released Can the fix for the most outdated health care system in America really be more of the same? The breach between what we fund and what veterans get from the VA is getting larger. The gap between our good intentions and the help those in need actually receive is growing broader.  It is time for something fresh. Our old federal government's inability to do what it promises is one reason it is less popular than King George III during the American Revolution and Congress, on a good day, has a favorability rating of approximately 9%.   Instead of blaming Obama, I'd urge Republicans and Democrats to propose real change:  Transform our old, closed bureaucratic VA system to an open health care system. It's time veterans who don't want to travel five hours or wait for months were allowed equal access to all the health care available to the rest of us. The most critical decisions about a veteran's health shouldn't be made the old way: top-down, politically and artificially, by a pulseless bureaucracy that reports to Washington. Those decisions should be made naturally and bottom-up, closer to life, in the sacred space between doctors and those who have offered the highest possible sacrifice to our nation.

Obamacare a disaster that needs fixing,"The rollout of the federal Obamacare website has been a disaster, full stop. There can be no excuses, nor will I be making any. It's been clear for years what needed to be done, and failing was not an option. The exchanges, and the website that allowed access to them, had to work, and they just do not. I wrote a week or two ago that the initial problems with the HealthCare.gov  website appeared to be because of volume issues. That could be spun as either a positive or negative thing. But it now seems that the surge was not the cause of the malfunctions. After the first weekend, when the administration added additional capacity to the servers, the issues didn't go away.  What are they? I wish I could say for sure. But some good reports have come out that detail just a few of the problems.  Have you had trouble signing up? Tell us your experience The first appears to be that the administration decided that people would need to provide a significant amount of personal detail to look at coverage options. I can attest to this first-hand. I have insurance through my work, so I don't need exchange coverage, but I was still interested in looking at what was available.  I had to provide a lot of information, about my job and family, before I could do so. It's possible that this was because administrators wanted to be able to provide subsidy information to people with the premium costs, so as to soften the blow of how expensive insurance could be, but no one knows for sure. Regardless, this complicated things significantly. But that's just the front end. The back end is also a real problem.  Insurance companies are reporting that the data they are receiving from the HealthCare.gov website is garbled. This means that automatic processing of the insurance plans being ordered is impossible.  Oddly enough, the problems on the front end are actually helping here. So few orders are actually making it through that insurance companies are able to sort through the bad data by hand to complete enrollment. But if things improve on the front end, then there's no way these companies can do millions of applications without good data. The administration is bragging that upwards of half a million applications have started. Shockingly few of them have been completed, though.  The front end has a number of steps, including submitting your information, assessing for eligibility and then shopping for insurance. The number being cited by the administration refers only to people who have completed the first step.  There are people who believe that government can never do things as well as the private sector. I'm not one of those people. But in this specific instance, those people have a point.  Evidently, those in charge of the rollout of the exchange website were unprepared. They didn't have the necessary experience to manage the more than 50 different contractors producing software independently that would eventually need to function together as a whole. This is incredibly technical work, and it's not clear that government was in a good position to direct things here.  It appears that the Obama administration has learned its lesson.  Administration officials are now calling in ""more computer experts"" to try and fix the problem. But this may be too little, too late. Some are saying that even if the administration pours in massive resources, the problems may not be fixed by December 15, the deadline for when insurance needs to be bought for it to be covering people on January 1. Even if the administration can get this done within a month, some in the insurance industry are concerned that these issues may act as a filter to dissuade healthy people from getting insurance. If it's really, really hard to complete an application, then only truly ill people may have the perseverance to do so.  That could lead to problems in the pool of people signing up for insurance. The administration needs healthy people to buy insurance, too, for the exchanges to function optimally If we were talking about a company having mismanaged things so badly, you could be sure that heads would roll. Many would be fired, and there would be a change in management. But that may not be possible here. Were Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to go,  President Barack Obama couldn't get someone else vetted and through the Senate nomination process in an expedient manner. He's likely stuck with his current team, or no team at all. That doesn't mean Obamacare will fail. It's still possible that this could all be fixed. It's also possible that should significant issues continue, timelines might be adjusted to accommodate implementation issues. But these will cause problems political and real in nature.  Continued failures in the exchange rollout give the President's opponents fuel to attack him and his health care reform. More importantly, they prevent people who really do need insurance, and the care it allows, from getting what they need.   Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Crunch time for Obama and Washington,"It's not often that a presidential to-do list (and legacy-making agenda) comes down to a couple of key weeks, but here we are: gun control, immigration reform and the budget -- all front and center, right now. It's an odd time in Washington. The president has been dating Republicans, dining with senators with whom he has hardly spoken in the past. Republicans seem to believe they can actually work with the president -- on immigration, at least.  As for guns, well, some in the GOP seem ready to filibuster an issue -- background checks -- that has overwhelming public support. ""That won't do us a lot of good,"" moans one GOP pollster. ""We will look like the party taking extremist positions."" Should anyone be able to buy guns? Share your views Remember how well that worked with women in the last election? And then there's the budget. The president decided to propose one this year that starts with compromise -- containing some of the entitlement reforms that he worked out with House Speaker John Boehner before the ""grand bargain"" became the grand failure. A couple of senior GOP pollsters tell me that they can't quite figure out why the president did something guaranteed to annoy his liberal base.  How about this for an answer: When all else fails, it doesn't hurt to look credible. Better yet, it doesn't hurt actually to be credible. After all, what's the downside? ""When you are dealing with dysfunction, the best you can do is demonstrate that you are reasonable,"" one senior administration official tells me. ""The alternative would be throwing fuel on the flames. We need to be serious here."" It's about time. On all fronts. Understand this: This is a not a strategy hatched by a bunch of Pollyannas at the White House. It is borne of necessity, and bred with an understanding of a public that has just about had it with Washington. The president played tough in the sequester fight -- calling for new revenues -- and he lost. Now he's not overplaying his hand; he's playing it smart. On immigration, he's hanging back, letting congressional negotiators take the lead. He was called out for doing that on health care reform -- rightly so, allowing top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to manage an unpopular process and produce an unpopular bill. But this time, it's different: Republicans understand that immigration reform has now become a gateway issue. 'It's now a basic way for us to find our way back into national politics,"" one GOP pollster tells me. ""It doesn't solve our problem with Latino voters by itself, but it helps.""   Even polls show that a majority of GOP voters -- once opposed to reform -- are now on board with some version of it. The notion of a ""pathway to citizenship"" still stirs all kinds of fears about amnesty with the GOP base, but that's less of an issue these days: All things considered, any gain in Latino voters outweighs some shrinkage of the base.  It's a trickier route for the president on guns. Barack Obama didn't intend for gun control to be part of his second-term legacy; it came to be after Newtown. And this is an issue, by the way, that splits the Democratic Party more than it splits the GOP. A half-dozen Democratic Senate races in pro-gun states next year could hang in the balance.  And if the Democrats lose those senators -- and can't break a GOP filibuster -- it's dangerous for them, too. Not as dangerous, of course, as the GOP holding up any vote on a gun bill. That, I would argue, could have a great deal of impact on the midterm elections. Why? Because the president will continue to take the issue directly to the voters, 90% of whom agree with him on background checks.  It's a delicate time here in Washington. If nothing happens on guns, for instance, what about the rest of the Obama agenda? ""If you can't pass a bill on guns in this environment, what can you ever do?"" asks one senior administration official. ""It sets the bar so high for anything, people will be demoralized."" The result? Retreat. Maybe some sort of immigration reform passes (it's in everyone's self-interest) but no tax reform. No serious entitlement reform. Nothing big on the agenda, just small-scale items.  Perfect for politicians unable to respond to crisis, much less the will of the people.  Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.

We're in for a heck of a ride,"The third and final night of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, featured speeches by President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. The following contributors offered their assessments.  LZ Granderson:  Obama showed what he knows about fighting for the little guy President Obama did not promise heaven and earth, as he did four years ago. And it's a good thing because I doubt many would have believed him. Instead last night's speech at the Democratic National Convention served as a reminder that beyond the soaring rhetoric and heartwarming smile is a man whose entire adult life has been about fighting for the little guy. Not to win elections mind you, but because he was once a little guy himself and he comes from a hardworking, middle class -- and diverse -- family.  In that context he talked about the importance of establishing policies that are designed not to carry people but to lend a helping hand when needed. He emphasized education and the impetus behind health care reform.  True, he had some great zingers about the Romney/Ryan lack of foreign policy experience, but to me the most important part of the speech was that he took the notions of citizenship and change and gave them new life, reminding people of the changes they've already made together by voting for him and the changes that will come in a second term. It may not have been his best speech, but it was his best message.  LZ Granderson, who writes a weekly column for CNN.com, was named journalist of the year by the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association and is a 2011 Online Journalism Award finalist for commentary. He is a senior writer and columnist for ESPN the Magazine and ESPN.com. Follow him on Twitter: @locs_n_laughs     Analysis: Obama hit the marks he needed to Anne-Marie Slaughter: The real Obama doctrine: 'With power comes responsibility' The key line for me of Barack Obama's 2009 inaugural address was when he called for ""a new era of responsibility -- a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves, our nation and the world."" As a parent who spends a lot of time trying to drum into my sons that they have to take responsibility for their actions, failures as well as successes, I thought to myself: ""Barack Obama had a good mother!""  But this theme recurs again and again, so much so that I have long said that the real Obama doctrine in international affairs is from Spiderman: ""With power comes responsibility."" His consistent message to other nations is that if they seek the benefits of being a great power, they must also accept the obligations of upholding global order and playing by global rules.  That same philosophy came through strongly in his convention speech last night. The speech really took off when he stopped ticking off points aimed at various constituencies and started talking about citizenship: his fundamental conviction that Americans have responsibilities as well as rights; that it is up to us to govern ourselves and not just to expect government to provide for us. He has a deep commitment to the social contract as a contract, with mutual obligations on both sides.  When he turned to foreign policy, what struck me most was that he never talked about ""winning two wars,"" but rather ""ending them."" He was willing to face up to his responsibility as commander in chief, to recognize the full cost of lives ended and changed forever and to stare down the unavoidable truth that Iraq and Afghanistan are not wars that we can ""win"" in the traditional sense of vanquishing an enemy and going home. He has thus decided that his responsibility to our soldiers is to bring them home as quickly and safely as possible.  But what is our responsibility to the people of Afghanistan who have relied on us and had their lives changed profoundly by us for over a decade? To the people of Iraq? And going forward, what is the responsibility of the United States and other great powers not to the abstraction of international order but to the brutal and concrete reality of hundreds and even thousands of Syrians killed every day? Those are questions that a second Obama administration will have to answer. Anne-Marie Slaughter is a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University. She curates foreign policy on Twitter at: @slaughteram  Ana Navarro: We're in for a heck of a ride The Democrat Convention versus the Republican Convention...where shall I begin? Republicans were organized, methodical and formal. Democrats held a convention that was at most times barely controlled chaos, but it had a lot of energy and soul. It was political Mardi Gras.  The two very different conventions featured dramatically different nominees. Mitt Romney's speech was focused on introducing Mitt Romney to the nation. His acceptance speech was meant to tell us who he is, what has shaped him and what's in his heart. That's what he needed to do. Americans did not know much about him before the convention and before we trust him, we have to know him.  Barack Obama's speech was not an introduction. We know him already. It was a reminder of what he stands for. He admitted it hasn't been quick or pretty, but he's a president and commander in chief in control. That's what he needed to do. Four years go, Barack Obama was America's hope for change. Today, keeping Americans hopeful is his only hope for re-election. I attended both conventions. Actually, it would be more accurate to say I survived both conventions and have lived to tell the story.  I hate to admit it, but if the presidential race was solely based on who had the better convention, Mitt Romney would be gasping for air. But it's not. The debates and political advertising war are the other two legs of this stool. The conventions mark the start of the sprint to the finish. The two horses are now out of the gate, and we're in for a heck of a ride. Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and commentator, served as national Hispanic campaign chairwoman for John McCain in 2008 and national Hispanic co-chair for Jon Huntsman's 2012 campaign.   Opinion: We're in for a heck of a ride Robert Dallek: Expect to see a clear uptick The Democratic convention was notable for the stirring speeches, especially by Bill Clinton, President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama and Elizabeth Warren. The speeches underscored two fundamental truths about current and recent American politics. First, that winning elections and commanding public backing for a national agenda are dependent on a president's personal appeal or, perhaps better stated, likability. It was a compelling feature of these convention talks. The most successful presidents of the last century were those who created personal connections to the public: Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman in 1948, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. ""I miss the way your husband used to speak to me about my government,"" someone told Eleanor Roosevelt after FDR died. In a recent poll, JFK and Reagan had approval ratings of 85% and 74%, respectively.   A second distinguishing feature of these convention speeches was the emphasis on government's vital role in advancing the national well-being. All these speakers made the case for the government's part in promoting economic expansion and improving the quality of life for millions and future generations of Americans. Anyone who took note of how the New Orleans' levees built by the Army Corps of Engineers at a cost of $11 billion preserved the city from another disaster or read the news about the federally financed genome project that is bringing us closer to understanding the origins of many diseases would look foolish disputing the value of government.  It's difficult to imagine that President Obama and the Democrats won't see a clear uptick in standing from the style and substance of these speeches. Presidential historian Robert Dallek is completing a book on John F. Kennedy and his advisers.  Donna Brazile:  A message for citizens: You don't walk alone This week, former President Bill Clinton said that no president could have fully repaired in just four years the damage President Obama inherited. The American people recognize that. They know just how deep was the financial void and pervasive the virus of despair. They seem willing to concede that President Obama has done a lot: brought us out of the Great Recession -- and out of Iraq. As Vice-President Biden said, ""GM is alive and Bin Laden is dead."" Indeed, by any objective standard, President Obama has accomplished a lot. Considering the petty and intractable Republican opposition to every initiative and idea, it's remarkable, almost miraculous that we now have a reformed student loan system, renewed Wall street regulations and economic growth, and, oh, yes, Obamacare.  Still, we are not where we want to be or need to be. The recovery is slower than anyone wants. So the president had to answer a fundamental question: We know where we've been, but as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once asked, where do we go from here?  Last night, President Obama answered that question. He told us that hope is a hard path, but it is a righteous path to dignity. He told us that it is a path each of us must walk by ourselves, but that none of us can walk alone because at one time or another, we'll all stumble or stub our toe along the way.  I came away from the president's speech inspired, because he didn't flinch from the truth: ""America, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now. Yes, our path is harder, but it leads to a better place."" President Obama gave us a map: ""We celebrate individual initiative, but we also believe in something called citizenship. As citizens, we understand that America is not about what can be done for us. It's about what can be done by us, together, through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government."" The president told us, rightly, that the easy way is to go back, to look for shortcuts, or to stop when the path up is a little steeper than we expected. So, did he give us a vision for the future? Read these words, and you tell me:  ""...we travel together. We don't turn back. We leave no one behind. We pull each other up.  We draw strength from our victories, and we learn from our mistakes...knowing that Providence is with us.""

Why you should vote for Romney,"On October 3, I wrote a piece for CNN titled, ""Why you should vote for Romney."" At that point in the presidential race, Gov. Mitt Romney was 3.1 points behind Pres. Obama in the Real Clear Politics average of polls and the race looked like it was starting to slip away. 
 Since then Romney turned in one of the greatest debate performances in political history, energized his base, and kicked his campaign into high gear. For the first time, but the best time, Romney has the momentum in the race. His surge now has the race a virtual dead heat in the Real Clear average of polls. 

With Tuesday's crucial election on our doorstep, here's an updated version of my reasons to vote for Romney. Romney: My vision for America Business and management career success The American economy is in desperate need of a turnaround artist. Mitt Romney has made his career in the private sector doing exactly that --  turning around failing business and enterprises. During his time at Bain Capital, Romney was responsible for building companies that Americans shop at everyday -- Staples, Domino's Pizza, Sports Authority, and Brookstone. Of course, not all of his investments were successful and some companies failed, but on the whole, Bain Capital's returns for its investors were nothing short of stellar. In its independent analysis of Bain's record, The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Bain produced about $2.5 billion in gains for its investors in the 77 deals, on about $1.1 billion invested. Overall, Bain recorded roughly 50% to 80% annual gains in this period, which experts said was among the best track records for buyout firms in that era."" Romney was one of the most successful venture capitalists of the late 1980s and 1990s. The Obama administration attacks Romney's business career, but praises that of billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. That's quite the double standard. Perhaps, they should heed President Bill Clinton, who called Romney's business record ""sterling."" Romney's success didn't end at Bain. In 1999, he left to rescue the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics from the verge of collapse. Romney took control and managed the Olympics from debt and disaster into a national success. If Romney can thrive in the private sector, where 5 of 10 small businesses fail within five years, and the public sector, where regulations and inefficiencies often stifle success, surely he can help the U.S. economy back to its feet. In all three presidential debates, Romney demonstrated a mastery of the economic issues and came out ahead on the question of who would handle the economy better.  Politics: If Romney wins...
 Executive governing experience Romney took office as governor of Massachusetts in 2003, at a time when the state was undergoing its own recession. After the dot-com bubble burst, Massachusetts lost more than 200,000 jobs and had a $3 billion budget shortfall. Romney closed the budget deficit without raising state taxes, but by raising fees and closing tax loopholes. Although the number of jobs created during his term was ranked near the bottom compared with other states, Massachusetts did progress from shedding jobs to creating tens of thousands. The unemployment rate dropped from 5.6% to 4.7%. And he accomplished all this with a Democrat legislature. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Massachusetts topped the nation in eighth grade math and reading scores in 2007, the last year of Romney's term. While Romney did inherit what was arguably already the best school system in the country, he continued his own conservative reforms and was a good steward of the state education system in place. Today it consistently ranks as the best state education system in the United States. And thanks to Romney's state-led health care reform, in 2012, Massachusetts had the lowest percentage of uninsured, at 4.9%, according to a Gallup survey. Character and leadership  To hear many in the mainstream media describe Mitt Romney, he's out-of-touch, stiff, insensitive and uncaring. In all three presidential debates, Romney shattered that cardboard caricature created by millions of dollars of Obama's negative ads.  In reality, Mitt Romney, the man, husband and leader, is a deeply benevolent, compassionate, and decent man. In the debates that finally showed through and in the closing weeks of the campaign it has echoed around the country as Romney and his surrogates have proactively told the stories of the real Romney.  For example, in July 1996, Romney closed down all of Bain Capital  and sent his employees to New York City to search for the 14-year-old daughter of Robert Gay, a partner at Bain Capital. She had snuck off to a rave party in New York City and had been missing for three days. Romney set up a command search center in New York City, coordinated with the New York Police Department, put up posters all over the city, and sent out alerts. It wasn't long before the young girl was found in a basement suffering from ecstasy withdrawal. Referring to Romney's efforts, Gay said: ""It was the most amazing thing, and I'll never forget this to the day I die."" At the Republican Convention, Ted and Pat Oparowski told the tear-jerking story of their 14-year-old son, David, who was diagnosed with terminal Hodgkin's disease. Romney visited him frequently, becoming a close friend. At David's request, he wrote the young man's will and gave the eulogy at his funeral. These are the untold stories of a good and decent man. In 2011, Romney and his wife, Ann, gave almost 30% of their income to charity, more than $4 million. As Romney likes to say, compassion isn't measured by welfare or food stamps, but by the ability to lift people off welfare and food stamps. Each year he gives millions of his own dollars to help people in such a way. Opinion: What's really at stake in election 2012? Romney's plan After four years of President Obama's failed economic leadership, Romney would bring to the White House a specific, detailed plan for returning to fiscal responsibility and job creation. His plan would cut federal spending as a share of GDP to 20% by 2016. It would reform our complex tax code by reducing tax rates 20% across the board while eliminating loopholes, specifically those for the highest earners, and maintaining revenue neutrality. It would also reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate, now the highest in the world, to 25%. Under a Romney administration, the largest drivers of our debt would be reformed by giving more choice and responsibility to individuals rather than bureaucrats for managing their Medicare and Social Security. In the case of Medicaid, it would be block granted and sent back to the states.  Romney's plan will reduce onerous regulations and taxes, like Obamacare, and usher in a new era of fiscal certainty for business owners and entrepreneurs. Romney will also champion energy independence, will approve the Keystone pipeline and stop the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory war on coal. Borrowing from his experience in Massachusetts, Romney will push for more school choice for parents and students, performance pay for teachers, and, with 3 million skilled jobs going begging, new skills training for skilled workers. Finally, his pick of Rep. Paul Ryan as his vice presidential candidate cements his conservative credentials as a fiscal reformer bent on tackling the debt and entitlements, something our current president ignored. Since the first presidential debate, Romney has proven to the American people what many of us knew all along -- that he would bring to the White House real leadership instead of political grandstanding, responsibility instead of excuses, and bipartisan solutions instead of divisive gridlock. Romney has proven himself the man to lead America's comeback.  LZ Granderson: Why you should pick Obama"
Obama's message: 'I'm in charge',"It is sometimes said of a great actor that he could hold an audience spellbound while reading a laundry list. This is essentially what President Obama tried to do on Tuesday night. As State of the Union addresses go, his was artless. It lacked inspired phrases or compelling narrative. Save for the energy he gave it at key moments, it was pedestrian.   It was also very important. It was important because with it, Obama returned in earnest to the work of governing. Having won a clear victory in November, and having spent the intervening months putting out the wildfires our Congress likes to set, he delivered word Tuesday night that he had a clear and full agenda for his second term. Candidate Obama, the man who has dominated American politics for most of the last five years, seems gone for good. That version of our president may have had more poetry about him. But this version wants to actually get down to governing. Opinion roundup: How did Obama and Rubio do? Whether he can or not remains to be seen. Indeed, it seems certain that many, if not most, of the goals he set on Tuesday night will elude him. But the speech was also important because it sent several clear messages to his fellow politicians.   He said, ""I won. I am in charge. I will not shy away from a progressive agenda.""   He said, ""I know what I want. I'm not afraid of defeat as I was in the past. I will never run in another political campaign again.""    Oh, he didn't say these things literally. You won't find those words in the transcript. But look at the tape -- you'll find them in his body language and between the lines of his speech. The economy was his centerpiece -- but it was not just another campaign speech about growth. It was a speech about, as one of his team put it earlier in the day, ""growing the economy from the middle out."" He spoke about restoring the middle class and creating opportunity. From the beginning it was clear that this was no longer a speech about recovering from a crisis. It was not another speech about America at war. Obama's concern -- the crisis he was addressing -- was that incomes and job creation are stagnant even as the economy grows and corporate profits hit record levels. His prescription was clear. We must invest in America and in its people. In infrastructure, domestic energy resources, cleaner energy and energy efficiency, education, research and building the workforce through immigration reform. Obama called for raising the minimum wage to help lift up the poorest and better reward those among them who are willing to work for a living. He also sounded the theme that we must do all these things to better compete in the global economy, citing the examples of China, Germany and others whose examples he said we should heed and exceed. Even the portion of his speech that dealt with foreign policy was oriented to the domestic economy. Yes, he began with the newsworthy announcement that he would bring home half of all troops in Afghanistan by next year and end our war there the following year.  Yes, he talked about defeating al Qaeda even as it shape-shifted its way around the world.  And he addressed drone oversight, North Korea's nuclear test, Iran's nuclear program and the Middle East.   But many of his statements on these issues were formulaic. And the thrust of all of them -- even the boldest, like his return to his Prague promise of working to reduce nuclear stockpiles -- was enabling America to focus more energy on rebuilding its strength at home. Furthermore, perhaps the most important international thrusts had nothing to do with war at all. (His comments on cyberthreats, for example, were really directed at protecting intrusions against the private sector.)   Opinion: Obama dares Congress to get the job done Obama's renewed focus on climate, including his call for ""market-based"" solutions -- meaning reopening the idea of carbon markets or other such mechanisms, a couple of years after such ideas were considered by many to be dead -- was a return to promises made long ago. It was also a recognition of the urgency with which this global threat must be addressed. His new secretary of state, John Kerry, was the leading voice in the Senate on these issues and has already told his staff how important these and other environmental concerns would be. This issue was raised early in the speech, even though it is clearly something requiring global cooperation. It was an important shift of emphasis. Similarly, perhaps the biggest new foreign policy initiative Obama called for was opening of talks to achieve a trans-Atlantic trade agreement. This is a powerful idea that could be the centerpiece of second-term international economic policy. It would further enhance trade with the European Union, strengthen our Atlantic alliance and set the stage for its modernization in the 21st century, and open the way for a new global round of trade talks.  And finally, since agricultural trade reform is so central to big emerging powers like Brazil and India, it would help strengthen our relations with them.   Of all the elements of the speech, however, the most compelling and emotional was Obama's concluding section demanding a vote on reforming America's gun laws. Citing gun deaths in his hometown, Chicago, with the victims of violence in the gallery watching him, he demonstrated his newfound confidence by standing up to one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington, tackling an issue he himself had sidestepped earlier in his presidency.   Opinion: In 2013, democracy talks back  At that moment of the speech -- calling for real change in the wake of tragedies like the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut -- what we saw was a president in full, a man who knew his job, knew his power and was not afraid. He might or might not get the reforms he wanted. But he could certainly send a message to even his most obdurate opponents that he would use whatever tools and influence he had to demand they at least take a stand. One can only hope he will do more, go past getting a vote to getting the results we need -- background checks, bans on assault weapons and high-volume magazines, mental health care reform, a real effort to stop gun trafficking. But whatever the outcome, at that moment Tuesday night, the focused energy of this president at this stage of his presidency reverberated through the rafters of the Capitol and suggested that this long speech was not a laundry list but a to-do list, an agenda for change offered up by a confident and empowered advocate.

What is Bill Clinton up to?,"The interesting news in the latest CNN/ORC International poll that Bill Clinton is pulling a 66% favorable rating among Americans suggests the 42nd president has the power to help or hurt Barack Obama as the 2012 campaign enters its final five months.   The question is: Which has he been doing more of lately?  The poll was a reminder that Americans tend to be more forgiving of their presidents over time, no matter how long they served, which party they hailed from or how voters may have felt about a commander in chief at the moment he stepped down.  Jimmy Carter (54%), George Herbert Walker Bush (59%) and Clinton, who have been out of office between 31 and 11 years, all earned personal approval ratings north of 50%; only George W. Bush, who stepped down three years ago, is below 50%. But even his rating has improved since he returned to private life. Being an ex-president is almost always good for your approval rating.  Photos: Secrets of the Presidents Club, from Truman to Obama The CNN poll appears at the moment when Clinton has once again been playing an outsize role on the public stage, and many have suggested all sorts of theories and reasons for maneuvering. Some have read in his comments about Mitt Romney (he called his business record ""sterling"") a desire to undercut Obama or set the table for a run by his wife, Hillary, in 2016.  This analysis gained momentum when Clinton told CNBC that economics demanded that the Bush tax cuts should be extended temporarily. That comment led Clinton to apologize.  But the evidence doesn't really support a campaign of sabotage. A simpler explanation for Clinton's capering -- and one that better fits Clinton's record -- is that he is a permanent political consultant. And his ""candidate"" isn't paying close attention to his advice.  Clinton is trying to change the debate in the presidential campaign from one about the past to one about the future. Fighting about who did what in the 1980s, Clinton thinks, is a sure loser. Better to focus on who has the better plan going forward. (Remember the chorus of his campaign song? ""Don't stop thinking about tomorrow."") So he has taken his approach to the airwaves.  It is easy to forget that Clinton has differed with the White House in the past about how to frame a political race. In 2010, working through Vice President Joe Biden, he urged Obama to make the case that the president had done a number of things to improve the lives of Americans in his first two years and suggested the president campaign on his record. But the White House resisted this approach, fearing the stimulus and health care reform were not popular enough to brag about and instead tried to make the Republican agenda the issue. Clinton disagreed but (mostly) kept his mouth shut about it.  He doesn't seem willing to bite his tongue now.  Photos: Clinton's last days in office Clinton isn't the first president to meddle in presidential politics after his own presidency ended. So great was his dislike of Dwight Eisenhower that Harry Truman couldn't stay out of the 1952 race and even campaigned against Ike that fall. Richard Nixon made life unpleasant for Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primary (and seemed determined to undercut George Bush in 1992, to Clinton's benefit). But Clinton's grudge isn't personal; it's about how best to mount and run a campaign.  How much of his personal popularity Clinton will spend to win this argument is unclear, but nearing age 66, as the new poll shows, the former president has time to earn it back.

Why Obamacare? 3 Charts,"The Obamacare website might still be slow, but the politics and context of Obamacare are shifting rapidly.  On Thursday, to deal with some of the grousing about canceled insurance plans, President Obama announced an administrative fix to allow people to keep those crummy plans (that they think they like) for up to a year.  This should quiet some of the complaints within his own party, though certainly not Republicans, who will just find another reason to attack Obama and health care reform.   One hopes this fix will put the focus back on making Obamacare implementation as successful and effective as possible.    It's certainly not there yet.  On Wednesday, the Obama administration announced that just more than 106,000 Americans had enrolled in health insurance plans through Obamacare exchanges, and another 975,000 people had shopped for plans but not enrolled in a selection yet.  No one is cheering these numbers — well, no one except those Republicans who didn't want anyone to have access to affordable, quality private health insurance options in the first place. The 106,000 enrollments are well below the 500,000 the White House had originally projected for this period before launch of the exchanges. The brouhaha over canceled insurance plans has muddied an otherwise positive law.  But all of the above should be put in a broader context —the context of enrollment in past comparable insurance systems, the context of what health insurance was like before the Affordable Care Act  passed, and the context of its opponents' repeated lies meant to distort and destroy Obamacare.   So, here are three handy charts to help you understand the reality of Obamacare and separate fact from fear-mongering. CHART 1: Romneycare enrollment Looking for an analog to what Obamacare enrollment might look like nationwide?  Look no further than Massachusetts, which implemented a mini-version of Obamacare under then-Gov. Mitt Romney.  In 2007, Romneycare wasn't even plagued by a bum website rollout — and enrollment was still gradual, as shown in this chart (click on it to expand) and explained by Jonathan Cohn at The New Republic.  It can be expected that people who need Obamacare the most — either because they're sick or because they're sick of their current expensive individual insurance — will enroll first,  but everybody else, especially those who are currently uninsured, will wait until the last minute to sign up before they face the individual mandate penalty.  Plus, even people who want their new plan to kick in on January 1, 2014, have until December 15 to enroll in a plan.   Also, choosing among the many options in the Obamacare exchanges does take time — which might explain, for instance, why almost 1 million people have logged into the exchange but not yet chosen an insurance option.  With time, those numbers can be expected to grow.    CHART 2:  How bad it was before Obamacare We may need a reminder of how disastrous our health insurance system was before Congress passed Obamacare.  Just one way of looking at this is that health care spending as a percent of family income was already an astronomical 19% in 2009 but was projected to be 30% by 2019 and 48% by 2029 — unless something was done.   This reality is particularly lost when discussing the estimated 2% to 4% of Americans who have private insurance plans that will ultimately be canceled because of higher coverage standards set by the Affordable Care Act.  Many of those people will find they have even better options in the exchanges, and at better prices. But even the small percentage of folks who find themselves paying more for insurance should be seen in the broader context of  health care and insurance costs that were already skyrocketing out of control, for all of us, before Obamacare was passed.    CHART 3: About those canceled plans Finally, yes, Obama will implement an administrative fix so people can keep their lousy insurance plans for another year if they want to.  But insurance companies will now be required to tell people they have other (and in many cases, probably better) options in the new exchanges.  This will hopefully stop the practice of insurance companies trying to trick people with canceled plans into buying much more expensive new plans from the same company rather than shopping around. But it will likely not stop Republican finger-pointing and accusations that President Obama lied.  No matter that Obama apologized for the promise that people who liked their insurance plans could keep them, tried to clarify the situation and is implementing a fix in fulfillment of that pledge.  But wait, aren't Republicans the ones who came up with death panels and keep asserting that lie even though it was not only disproven but also called the ""lie of the year"" by PolitiFact?  To make the point that Republicans really shouldn't be pointing fingers in the lie department, Steve Benen came up with this chart to put  this into perspective:   So here's where this leaves us:  Not enough people have signed up for Obamacare yet, but there's still plenty of time; enrollment was slow when Massachusetts did this, too.  And the administrative fix announced on Thursday will, incidentally, ease the transition period to new plans while probably keeping enrollment numbers even lower since people can now keep their current plans an extra year.   Meanwhile, even a slow and clunky Obamacare rollout is better than the runaway health care costs and millions of uninsured Americans we had before Obamacare.  Republicans should stop trying to sabotage the law. Obamacare is slowly but steadily rising over the obstacles of our broken insurance status-quo -- and destructive Republicans.  When Obamacare is finally, fully implemented, our families, our health care system and our economy will all be better off.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
GOP health plans good for the rich,"The first day of 2014 was a day to celebrate in our history -- it was the first time that all Americans could buy health insurance regardless of pre-existing medical conditions, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.    But despite the good news, criticism of the ACA continues. Some Republicans have eagerly identified individuals who are not happy with the ACA.  Sanjay Gupta: Better health not about Obamacare, it's about you As 2014—a midterm election year—dawns, it is time to ask: What does the GOP offer other than negativism?  What is the GOP alternative to the ACA, who would it help and who would it hurt?  Until now, the Republican war cry has been repeal, for which they have voted repeatedly.  But ACA repeal is neither realistic, responsible, nor perhaps, even possible.  The 10 titles of the ACA contain hundreds of provisions that reform Medicare payment, combat fraud and abuse, and improve health care quality. Many are already in place.  Total repeal of the ACA would rip many threads already woven into the fabric of our health care system.  Opinion: When will we get the verdict on Obamacare? A targeted repeal of the less popular provisions of the ACA, the individual and employer mandates and some ACA taxes and fees, might be more feasible.   But revoking the mandates would disrupt insurance markets and repealing the taxes will increase the deficit.    Does the GOP have anything constructive to offer? The answer, sadly, is not really.      House Republicans have put forward two proposals -- the American Health Care Reform Act, sponsored by a majority of House Republicans, and Rep. Tom Price's Empowering Patients First Act. Both are lengthy bills that largely recycle longstanding Republican panaceas.  The American Health Care Reform Act would replace the ACA's income-based tax credits with flat dollar tax deductions. Tax deductions are valuable to high-income Americans with high tax rates, but offer little or nothing to the low-income Americans helped by the ACA.   The Empowering Patients First Act offers flat dollar tax credits that do not vary by age, geography, or health status—all of which could influence health insurance premiums. These tax credits might almost fully cover the health insurance premium of a young healthy male, but would be essentially useless to an older, low-income family, which would be left thousands of dollars short of the cost of basic coverage.   The American Health Care Reform Act touts health savings accounts as the solution to every problem, but tax-subsidized health savings accounts are also primarily of value to higher-income Americans and useless to Americans whose income is too low to be taxed and who lack discretionary income to invest in health savings accounts.    As the media spotlight high cost sharing under ACA plans in the coming months, it should ask how much higher cost sharing would be under the GOP plans. Conservatives, such as John Goodman, champion very high deductible policies, and Republican proposals, unlike the ACA, do not limit cost sharing.  By repealing the ACA, Republicans would reinstate pre-existing condition exclusions for many of the uninsured.  The primary relief they offer to the uninsured with health problems are state high-risk pools. High-risk pools, however, are very expensive, and without massive federal support would be unaffordable to many Americans.    Exclusion of Americans from insurance coverage would also likely increase under Republican proposals to permit interstate health insurance sales, which could drive a race to the bottom in state insurance regulation. Association health plans have a history of undermining state reforms aimed at covering individuals and groups with pre-existing conditions.   Opinion: Why I signed up for Obamacare One cannot imagine a GOP health care proposal that did not promise to place more barriers in the way of Americans injured by medical negligence who seek compensation.  Although our medical litigation system could certainly use reform, proposals for change would reduce health care costs by only a small amount: half a percent, according to the Congressional Budget Office, including defensive medicine.  Republican malpractice ""reform"" proposals may be politically popular, but do not address our health care system's real problems.    The GOP does not promise that if you like your insurance plan you can keep it, and with good reason.  The vast majority of privately insured Americans are covered through their work.  The American Health Care Reform Act would abolish current deductions and exclusions for employer-sponsored health insurance. This would not only be one of the largest middle class tax increases in American history, but could result in millions of Americans losing employer-sponsored insurance.  Whatever disruptions the ACA may cause in coming months, it moves us toward more comprehensive and affordable coverage for low- and middle-income and sicker Americans.    The alternatives proposed by House Republicans would be very disruptive, and unsurprisingly, benefit the healthy and wealthy. Americans must ask themselves: Who offers the most needed reforms for our health care system?     Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion"
"Obama 2.0: Smarter, tougher -- but wiser?","On the eve of his second inaugural, President Obama appears smarter, tougher and bolder than ever before. But whether he is also wiser remains a key question for his new term. It is clear that he is consciously changing his leadership style heading into the next four years.  Weeks before the November elections, his top advisers were signaling that he intended to be a different kind of president in his second term.  ""Just watch,"" they said to me, in effect, ""he will win re-election decisively and then he will throw down the gauntlet to the Republicans, insisting they raise taxes on the wealthy.  Right on the edge of the fiscal cliff, he thinks Republicans will cave.""   What's your Plan B, I asked.  ""We don't need a Plan B,"" they answered. ""After the president hangs tough -- no more Mr. Nice Guy -- the other side will buckle.""  Sure enough, Republicans caved on taxes.  Encouraged, Obama has since made clear he won't compromise with Republicans on the debt ceiling, either. Foreman: My last letter to the president Obama 2.0 stepped up this past week on yet another issue: gun control.  No president in two decades has been as forceful or sweeping in challenging the nation's gun culture.  Once again, he portrayed the right as the enemy of progress and showed no interest in negotiating a package up front. In his coming State of the Union address, and perhaps in his inaugural, the president will begin a hard push for a comprehensive reform of our tattered immigration system.  Leading GOP leaders on the issue -- Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, for example -- would prefer a piecemeal approach that is bipartisan. Obama wants to go for broke in a single package, and on a central issue -- providing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented residents -- he is uncompromising.   After losing out on getting Susan Rice as his next secretary of state, Obama has also shown a tougher side on personnel appointments. Rice went down after Democratic as well as Republican senators indicated a preference for Sen. John Kerry.  But when Republicans also tried to kill the nomination of Chuck Hagel for secretary of defense, Obama was unyielding -- an ""in-your-face appointment,"" Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, called it, echoing sentiments held by some of his colleagues.   Will Obama's second inauguration let America turn the page? Republicans would have preferred someone other than Jack Lew at Treasury, but Obama brushed them off.  Hagel and Lew -- both substantial men -- will be confirmed, absent an unexpected bombshell, and Obama will rack up two more victories over Republicans.   Strikingly, Obama has also been deft in the ways he has drawn upon Vice President Joe Biden. During much of the campaign, Biden appeared to be kept under wraps. But in the transition, he has been invaluable to Obama in negotiating a deal with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the fiscal cliff and in pulling together the gun package.  Biden was also at his most eloquent at the ceremony announcing the gun measures.   All of this has added up for Obama to one of the most effective transitions in modern times. And it is paying rich dividends: A CNN poll this past week pegged his approval rating at 55%, far above the doldrums he was in for much of the past two years. Many of his long-time supporters are rallying behind him. As the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to score back-to-back election victories with more than 50% of the vote, Obama is in the strongest position since early in his first year. Smarter, tougher, bolder -- his new style is paying off politically. But in the long run, will it also pay off in better governance?  Perhaps -- and for the country's sake, let's hope so. Yet, there are ample reasons to wonder, and worry. Avlon: GOP's surprising edge on diversity Ultimately, to resolve major issues like deficits, immigration, guns and energy, the president and Congress need to find ways to work together much better than they did in the first term. Over the past two years, Republicans were clearly more recalcitrant than Democrats, practically declaring war on Obama, and the White House has been right to adopt a tougher approach after the elections.   But a growing number of Republicans concluded after they had their heads handed to them in November that they had to move away from extremism toward a more center-right position, more open to working out compromises with Obama. It's not that they suddenly wanted Obama to succeed; they didn't want their party to fail.   House Speaker John Boehner led the way, offering the day after the election to raise taxes on the wealthy and giving up two decades of GOP orthodoxy.  In a similar spirit, Rubio has been developing a mainstream plan on immigration, moving away from a ruinous GOP stance.   One senses that the hope, small as it was, to take a brief timeout on hyperpartisanship in order to tackle the big issues is now slipping away.    Zelizer: Second-term Obama will play defense While a majority of Americans now approve of Obama's job performance, conservatives increasingly believe that in his new toughness, he is going overboard, trying to run over them. They don't see a president who wants to roll up his sleeves and negotiate; they see a president who wants to barnstorm the country to beat them up. News that Obama is converting his campaign apparatus into a nonprofit to support his second term will only deepen that  sense. And it frustrates them that he is winning: At their retreat, House Republicans learned that their disapproval has risen to 64%. Conceivably, Obama's tactics could pressure Republicans into capitulation on several fronts. More likely, they will be spoiling for more fights. Chances for a ""grand bargain"" appear to be hanging by a thread.   Two suspicions are starting to float among those with distaste for the president. The first is that he isn't really all that committed to bringing deficits under control. If he were, he would be pushing a master plan by now. Instead, it is argued, he will tinker with the deficits but cares much more about leaving a progressive legacy -- health care reform, a stronger safety net, green energy, and the like.   Politics: Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company Second, the suspicion is taking hold that he is approaching the second term with a clear eye on elections ahead. What if he can drive Republicans out of control of the House in 2014? Then he could get his real agenda done. What if he could set the stage for another Democrat to win the presidency in 2016? Then he could leave behind a majority coalition that could run the country for years, just as FDR did. Democrats, of course, think the real point is that Obama is finally showing the toughness that is needed.     We are surely seeing a new Obama emerge on the eve of his second term. Where he will now lead the country is the central question that his inaugural address and the weeks ahead will begin to answer.   Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

A pitch to CEOs on health care -- lead with your wallets,"The current political firestorm over health care, fueled by moves to repeal the Affordable Care Act without  offering an alternative, opens the door for an unlikely group to take radical action -- the country's CEOs. They could unite and present to the country with a simple message: ""Our shareholders are demanding that the nation's political leaders get real about the health-care crisis. From a fiduciary standpoint, we can't continue to support any health-care system that drains our equity and competitiveness.  ""A single-payer, 'Medicare for all' system, with its miniscule administrative cost, would check all the boxes in any Harvard Business School manual for effective programs. We endorse single payer because it's the best business plan for the economy and our businesses.""   Understandably, people would be skeptical about trusting the business community to play such a pivotal role in shaping a system that means life or death for millions of citizens.  After all, businesses too often embrace a set of short-sighted practices that have fostered greed, the exploitation of workers, decades-long inequality and our planetary ecological crisis.  But, the beauty of this appeal is that, from the get-go, we can give license to the titans of industry to toss aside the moral aspects of the virtues of single-payer (in other words, the annoying spectacle of people either dying or going bankrupt because of a lack of affordable health care). It's a glorious case of pure economic self-interest. Here is what CEOs should be able to see. Two dominant wings of the health-care reform debate have been locked in battle for decades but particularly since the early 1990s. On one side of the spectrum sit mislabeled ""free market"" health care advocates, whose camp cries out ""government control"" or ""waiting times"" or ""reduced development"" with no basis in fact. They mislabel themselves as representative of the free market because the health care industry (insurance and pharmaceutical companies) is the opposite of a free market. The industry benefits, among other things, from massive tax breaks, subsidies and trademark protections which heap costs on the public and, indeed, stifle competition.  This wing is mostly content to force customers to pay whatever prices the industry demands. While generally a Republican redoubt, plenty of ""pro-business"" Democrats walk this line. For example, a recent Senate amendment to allow for importation of cheaper drugs was defeated with the help of 13 Democrats -- including Cory Booker, Patty Murray and Robert Menendez.  On the other side of the debate are approaches best defined as the Clinton-Obama plans. Each were content, in their own ways, to try to bend the cost curve but not fundamentally alter the system.  The Clinton health-care effort and President Obama left intact a grossly inefficient system. Indeed, the insurance industry spent billions of dollars promoting the Affordable Care Act because, by requiring citizens to opt in to avoid a penalty, the system delivered millions of new customers, and promised huge profits.  Neither of those wings has transformed our system into what every sane developed country has -- a single-payer system that is a normal component of a thriving economy   Such a system would look very much like the proposal put forward by Bernie Sanders during his campaign for president. Employers would have paid a 6.2% levy in his proposed plan -- yet the average annual cost to cover a worker with a family making $50,000 a year would have dropped from $12,591 to just $3,100.  So, a medium sized company of 1,000 workers would save close to $9.5 million. Scale that up to a company like Apple, which says it directly employs over 76,000 people, and Apple would bank a cool extra $1.1 billion to put to a more productive use. Before CEOs hear the weak accusations that single payer is fine and dandy for those European socialists in Scandinavia or France, consider the experience in Australia.  After a very vigorous debate in the 1980s, the country adopted what is essentially a single-payer system in 1984, though a highly regulated private system also exists alongside the public one (it services, for example, non-citizens).  In 2014, Australia's health-care system ranked sixth out of 51 countries in efficiency -- the US was 44th. Australia spent 9% of its GDP on health care, compared to the US 17% in the United States. These aren't socialists running the country, either. Australia has been governed for the past four years by a center-right coalition led by the conservative Liberal Party, which has never proposed rolling back the single-payer system. Indeed, when the Liberals recently proposed a $7 copay to see a general practitioner, the government's popularity cratered -- and it backed off the idea.  More important, there is virtually no chance the Australian business community would want to shoulder costs now mastered by the efficient public health care system.  Embracing single payer in the US would also divert money into peoples' pockets in increased wages. For the past two decades, the greatest source of conflict in collective bargaining focused on company demands to both cut health care coverage and raise workers' contribution. Virtually no money was left for wage increases -- partly accounting for the national flat wage growth over that period. Taking health-care costs out of the equation of collective bargaining, or even in nonunion workplaces, would mean bigger paychecks -- assuming companies didn't divert the savings into nonproductive CEO pay.  Lastly, by virtually every measure worldwide, a single-payer system produces results that actually keep people healthier. They get preventive treatment, comprehensive care and never risk their health by skipping taking prescribed drugs -- as they do in the US -- because of the outrageous costs. That translates into a healthier workforce, fewer missed days at work and a more productive worker when they are on the job, because fit in body, as we know, translates into fit in mind. Thus, companies who currently don't offer health care or only offer -- like Walmart -- a bare bones, expensive health care option would benefit, for a marginal cost, because of a larger percentage of hale and hearty employees. It's an astonishing opportunity for CEOs because they could, with one policy gambit, save billions of dollars on the bottom line, give workers a raise, have more money to invest in research and development, improve international competitiveness and, for a change, earn the respect, admiration and gratitude of millions of Americans. This is an easy one: lead with your wallets, not your hearts."
GOP health bill is a front for big tax breaks,"When the House of Representatives recently passed a $1 trillion tax cut disguised as a health care bill, one Republican in Washington spoke up against what he saw as the real motivation behind the bill. ""I think it's to set up tax reform,""  Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy said in remarks to the American Hospital Association, ""and all the money used for coverage is instead going to be used to pay down the bill for tax reform.""    Cassidy's resistance to using health care reform as a front to slash taxes for the wealthy is not a popular position in his own party. But he is absolutely right about the true intentions behind this proposal: Republicans are jamming through a massive tax giveaway under utterly false pretenses. With the process now moving behind closed doors in the Senate, and Washington increasingly consumed with investigating the troubling links between the President and Russia, it is critical that Democrats expose and defeat this cynical ploy. Soon after his emotional monologue about his son's heart condition went viral, Jimmy Kimmel hosted Cassidy on his show to talk about the health care debate. Wouldn't it be easier, Kimmel asked, to achieve the goal of covering more people and making health care more affordable if Congress simply did away with trying to pass a tax cut for millionaires at the same time? 	 Cassidy agreed with Kimmel. ""Tell the American people to call their senators,"" he urged.	 We must take him up on that. As the Senate begins considering -- in secret, at the moment -- what to preserve and what to eliminate from the House bill, we should deliver a loud and clear message to Washington: leave those wasteful tax cuts on the cutting room floor.  The truth is, the Republican health care plan achieves very little when it comes it to actual health care. The bill does not, as President Trump promised, increase the number of insured Americans. It does the opposite: 23 million more Americans would lack insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office's newest estimate released earlier this week. The bill does, however, provide -- by one independent estimate from the Tax Policy Center -- the richest Americans with an average tax cut of $37,000. Health insurance companies would receive a $145 billion tax cut. Investors would see taxes on their capital gains slashed by $158 billion. These giveaways are a feature, not a bug, of the House health care plan as intended by its authors. In the rollicking negotiations that led up to the House bill's passage, many provisions underwent major changes, but the tax cuts remained intact throughout. These tax cuts also actively thwart the objectives of making coverage more accessible and affordable.  They would come at the expense of programs that deliver health care to some of the country's most vulnerable populations. The CBO estimates that Medicaid alone would lose $880 billion, or 25% of its funding. Enrollees in the program -- which covers women, children, the elderly and disabled -- could face new, arbitrary caps on coverage. Far from empowering states, these structural changes to Medicaid would shift an impossible burden to governors, hospitals and others on the front lines in local communities. Inevitably, many of those most in need -- in places like my home city of South Bend, Indiana, and around the country -- would almost certainly be forced to go without care. There would be other less-discussed impacts from these Medicaid cuts as well. Over the years, those of us in local government have come to know the critical role Medicaid plays in helping school districts meet the needs of children with disabilities. Medicaid provides around $4 billion annually in reimbursements for schools to make investments like hiring health professionals, such as speech pathologists and physical therapists, who serve special needs students. This aid would be in jeopardy under the House plan. On top of all this, President Trump's budget takes these senseless cuts a giant step further by proposing even deeper reductions -- this time, to children's health insurance and Social Security disability benefits -- for the sake of funding even more extravagant tax cuts.  Protecting these programs should be a bipartisan priority. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to leave Medicaid and Social Security alone. Red and blue states alike have successfully expanded their Medicaid enrollments since passage of the Affordable Care Act. That includes my state of Indiana, where then-Gov. Mike Pence's decision to accept a form of expansion has made 400,000 residents eligible for Medicaid.  A few Republicans in the Senate -- like Rob Portman of Ohio and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- have promised to oppose the House bill's proposed Medicaid cuts. But safeguarding Medicaid expansion is likely going to be impossible if Republicans continue to insist on giving millionaires a tax cut as part of the deal. To make the legislation's math work, you can likely afford only one or the other.  There are literally millions of lives at stake when it comes to the issue of health care. Congress should be ashamed of itself if it treats this as just another opportunity to provide a tax windfall for the fortunate few."
"Conflict is a feature of democracy, not a flaw","It doesn't look broken to me. Rather, government today looks like the focus of a fierce debate over what it stands for and what it can accomplish. Democrats, in rough terms, think the government can be a useful social engine to protect the environment, help the poor and build the economy. Republicans, in similar outline, think the government often does more harm than good, and a less-regulated private sector will help us all more than government programs. These are profound ideological differences, not a failure of intelligence or energy on either side. But the unwillingness of Democrats and Republicans to agree is often taken as a kind of mindless intransigence rather than principled disagreement. Take NoLabels.org, a high-profile national organization that is trying to organize around what it calls a nonpartisan agenda. In its statement of purpose, NoLabels says, ""Our political discourse increasingly offers up cynical, petty partisanship at the expense of practical solutions to the challenges facing our national well-being."" NoLabels trades on a persistent mythology that ""practical solutions"" exist somewhere out there, but politicians simply refuse to find or accept them. Not so -- as NoLabels itself proves. If these solutions are so apparent, why doesn't the NoLabels website provide any?  The group proposes to organize members, hold meetings, create chapters and raise money, and it calls on politicians to make ""tough choices,"" but ... to do what? That's not clear. The NoLabels ""declaration"" asserts, ""We may disagree on issues, but we do so with civility and mutual respect."" That's dandy, but it's also vapid.  There are substantive differences between the political parties that involve matters of principle. Abortion either will or will not be legal. Ditto for same-sex marriage. And the differences go well beyond social issues. Taxes on the wealthiest citizens (and everyone else) will go up or down or remain the same. Our troops will or will not return from Afghanistan and Iraq. These issues don't have ""right answers"" that are somehow invisible to us now. People with different world views see them differently -- and always will. Of course, politicians should always explore the possibilities for reasonable compromise. Many issues -- like taxes and budgets, for example -- are amenable to agreements that give something to each side. And it's not just substance that separates the parties; their tactics are different, too. In the crisis over the raising of the debt ceiling this summer, any realistic assessment of the positions of both parties would conclude that the Democrats compromised their views a lot more than the Republicans.  That's just a fact, and journalists have the obligation to point out which side is more amenable to compromise. It's easy for us to fall into the same trap as NoLabels and apportion responsibility mindlessly and equally to both sides. But there are differences between the parties -- important differences in both substance and strategy. Democrats won major victories in the elections of 2006 and 2008, and produced the results you would expect from their party: health care reform, a stimulus program, an automobile industry bailout and an end to the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. After the Republican landslide of 2010, tax cuts, deregulation and defunding of Planned Parenthood and National Public Radio moved to the top of the agenda.  Frankly, this is as it should be. Elections matter. Labels matter. Conflict is not a flaw in our system; it's a feature of it."
Are politicians too rich to understand us?,"In this age of austerity, America is run by men with wealth that could have leapt from the pages of ""The Great Gatsby."" The president's worth is estimated at $8.3 million, while Mitt Romney's is placed at a staggering $255 million.  Both have tried to make a character issue out of each other's lifestyle -- conservatives complain that President Barack Obama takes too many vacations and White House aides say that Romney is living on ""another planet."" Given his wealth, Romney could probably afford to buy one. He has filed an application to bulldoze his $12 million house in La Jolla, California, and build an even bigger one on top of it. How can either of these men empathize with the financial plight of America's middle class?  American democracy is saturated with cash. Last week in Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker spent $30.5 million to beat Tom Barrett, who personally raised just $3.9 million. Adding super PAC spending, the race generated about $63.5 million.  Tea party members will say that Democrats have little right to complain about the amount of money spent on a recall election that they triggered. But there's no denying that the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which opened the floodgates for corporate campaign contributions, helped Walker keep his governorship. Forbes estimates that 14 billionaires gave to the Republican incumbent; only one of them lives in Wisconsin. Discussion about the role of money in politics invariably centers on campaign donations. But with such gigantic sums flying around, there has to be a cultural impact, too. Politics has become so saturated with cash that its protagonists have started to feel surreally detached from everyday life. On the Democratic side, there was Anna Wintour's bizarre ad celebrating her wonderful life and inviting Obama supporters to have dinner with her and Sarah Jessica Parker.  For the Republicans, you may remember Romney's attempt to make a $10,000 bet with Rick Perry. But the best has to be Rick Santorum's moving claim that he, too, had suffered in the credit crunch because his house fell 25% in value. Before you well up, that's a fall from $2 million to $1.6 million. Everybody suspects that politicians are rolling in money, but a review of the figures might surprise even the most cynical. The average citizens' annual income is $49,445. In  2010, the average net worth of a U.S. senator was $13.2 million, and the average worth of a House member was $5.9 million. The wealth is spread across both parties: In fact, seven out of 10 of the richest senators are Democrats. Romney, Obama: Why they have trouble connecting One side effect is that Washington has gained impressive financial and cultural clout. In  2011, Washington became the richest city in the United States. Its average income of $84,000 is 60% higher than the national median. There are several reasons for this. Washington is surrounded by rich suburbs; the government actually grew during the recession, and federal employee compensation averages out at $126,000. Most importantly, the city is a magnet for lobbyists. Lobbying and campaign work have become big businesses that offer huge dollar rewards to rival the returns of 1980s junk bonds. Betting on candidates or special interests has become a form of speculation: Land a big client and a lobbyist could cream off a sizable percentage.  Then there's the Wall Street money. Since 1998, the financial sector has outspent any other sector in lobbying, to the tune of $4.6 billion. In 2011, it employed more than 1,000 lobbyists and spent more than $82 million.  Of course, most members of Congress earned their money the good old-fashioned way (including marrying and inheriting it), and the voter shouldn't necessarily hold their success against them. One politician who stands out for having a comparatively unsettled financial situation is Obama. Yes, his $8.3 million is a lot of money, but he comes from an unusually impoverished background, including a period lived on food stamps. His contemporary wealth is built on a mix of his salary and royalties from his popular books. Still the days of the citizen legislator are long gone.  The intensity of luxury and wealth has to affect the ability of lawmakers to empathize with voters on very low salaries or none at all. It's easy to imagine that the debate over health care reform or the Bush tax cuts is affected by the fact that, for many people on the Hill, the former is an academic question and the latter is personally advantageous. This isn't a partisan liberal statement. The median identity of a congressman is a rich, white, middle-aged, male lawyer. There is a deficit of experience of running a business or trying to survive on welfare payments. There is a good case for another round of campaign finance reform, although Citizens United will make any such effort hard to accomplish. But even if individual or corporate contributions were limited, this wouldn't affect a bigger cultural problem in contemporary Washington. Government is increasingly run by people who, financially, have little in common with their constituents.  Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Don't link video games with mass shootings,"The horrible shooting at Washington Navy Yard adds to the recent litany of mass shootings in the United States.  Much attention typically focuses on what we, as a society, might do to prevent similar events in the future.  Unfortunately, the line between reasonable reflection and cultural crusade can sometimes be blurred, with activists drawing in shootings to advance their particular axes to grind.    Since the 1999 Columbine massacre, that issue has often been violent video games.  So it should come as no surprise that we have already seen some speculation about whether the Washington Navy Yard shooter, Aaron Alexis, may have played violent games.   Earlier this week, an op-ed by Dr. Brad Bushman may have crossed the line from science to advocacy.    I respect Dr. Bushman and understand that he speaks in good faith about his concerns regarding violent video games. Yet, the field he portrays in his op-ed is not one that I recognize.  Research linking violent video games to even mild acts of aggression has been, at best, inconsistent and, as the Supreme Court noted in 2011, often methodologically flawed.   That's not to say some good research isn't being done, but it's not possible for the research to clearly link playing violent games to mild aggression, let alone societal violence.  Implying that laboratory research conducted with college students, no matter what the outcome, can be generalized to mass shooters is irresponsible.   Even the studies Dr. Bushman refers to are not as clear-cut as he suggests.  For instance, in discussing his meta-analysis, he implies that the 136 articles he reviewed on video game violence were consistent in outcome, which, in fact, they were not.  He also neglects to mention that, in his own meta-analysis, video game effects dropped significantly when only a few controls were included.   For instance, in his analysis of long-term outcome studies, video game violence effects dropped to nearly zero when simply gender and prior aggression were controlled.  Furthermore, at the time his meta-analysis was published, colleagues including John Kilburn and myself expressed concerns in the same journal that Dr. Bushman and his coauthors had neglected to include many studies finding no links between video game violence and aggression in their analysis.   Dr. Bushman also refers to one of his studies suggesting that college students who played an action game were more accurate with a lifelike pistol.  He extends this research to imply that mass shooters may be more accurate due to playing video games.  This also, to me, seems a considerable overreach.  Alexis had actual military training which would seem more relevant than video games, and shooting unarmed civilians typically requires no great feat of marksmanship.  It's important to note as well that Dr. Bushman's study is, as of yet, unreplicated.   Dr. Bushman also neglects to mention considerable research that conflicts with his views.  For instance, in a recent study my colleague Cheryl Olson and I found little evidence that violent video games had negative influences on children with pre-existing mental health problems.  It would seem this study would bear on speculation that some mentally ill individuals may be susceptible to video game effects, so it is curious it went unmentioned.   Contrary to Dr. Bushman's suggestion, violent video games are not a commonality among mass homicide perpetrators. The impression that a link exists is a classic illusory correlation in which society notes the cases that fit and ignores those that don't.  When a shooter is a young male, the news media make a fuss over violent video games, typically forgetting to inform the public that almost all young males play violent video games.  Thus, finding that a particular young shooter happened to play violent games is neither surprising nor meaningful.   However, we've seen a rash of high-profile gun violence committed by men over the age of 60 (William Spengler, Douglas Harmon, Jimmy Lee Dykes, etc.) in past months.  Since these incidents don't fit the common social narrative of the mad gamer, they are simply ignored.   Lastly, Dr. Bushman advocates legal restrictions on violent video game access.  However, since the Supreme Court's Brown v EMA ruling (2011), which also criticized much of this research field, such efforts are clearly in violation of the First Amendment.   In a recent appearance on CNN, video game researcher Patrick Markey cautions scholars not to be irresponsible in extending research in our field beyond where it can go.  I echo his comments here.  In the 1950s, psychiatrists testified before congress that comic books caused not only delinquency but homosexuality because, they claimed, Batman and Robin were secretly gay.  We have to be careful not to repeat these mistakes.      The picture that is emerging of Alexis is one common to most mass shooters whether young or old, man or (rarely) woman -- a resentful man full of anger and struggling with mental health problems.   Making big claims about video games contributing to societal violence runs two risks -- damaging the credibility of the scholars who make such claims, and distracting us from real issues such as mental health care reform.

Will tea party purists back imperfect Romney?,"After watching the GOP presidential debate the other night, it was hard to avoid this conclusion: Mitt Romney looks more and more like the GOP presidential nominee. He's the best debater. He's got his issues and his rejoinders down pat. He brushes away his opponents like lint on his lapel. And all with such ease.   That said, there's a teensy problem he just can't seem to beat: Conservatives don't like him.  Or trust him. Or really want him to be the GOP nominee.  Sure, you say, Republicans never like their nominees, and they still manage to vote for them. There is truth to that: At this point in 2007, John McCain was still at 17% in the polls. Eventually, only Sarah Palin could make him palatable to conservatives. The Bushes were never right-wing faves. Neither were Richard Nixon or Gerald Ford. Even Ronald Reagan had candidates running to his right. And as for Bob Dole, well, he was suspect, but at least he was a war hero.           This year was supposed to be different. This was to be the time for the tea party to flourish and nominate a true believer. It's the moment, we were told, for an out-of-the-box Republican who would be against everything Barack Obama supports, like health care reform or bank bailouts. Fine, except that Mitt Romney's Massachusetts health plan was a model for Obama (as the president fondly points out). And Romney told us during the debate that he supported the bank bailouts. (""Action had to be taken."") If this keeps up, the tea partiers will be back at the harbor -- throwing themselves in. Or, they can decide to suck it up and try to win. The problem with purity in politics is that it's hard to find the perfect human torch-bearer. (Just ask evangelicals about the Pat Robertson campaign. Or liberal Democrats about President Obama.) The tea party movement was always about ideas, but when it searched for a sole leader, it came up short. Sarah Palin? She's off giving a big-bucks speech in South Korea this week, and when she's back, she'll continue feeding money into her PAC. Michele Bachmann is fading fast. Rick Perry's quick rise has been matched only by his precipitous decline. And Herman Cain could be another shooting star. So much for perfect.  Political disappointment for purists is hardly a new development.  ""This is what has happened regularly since 1984 with the religious right,"" said GOP strategist Vin Weber, now aligned with Mitt Romney. ""I think they will get past this, because they really want to beat Obama.""  In other words, Romney's plausibility as a winner will trump his obvious deficits as a conservative leader.   ""The tea party folks will go home and say they're not happy with the nomination process,"" added unaffiliated GOP strategist Scott Reed. ""Then they will say that 'whomever we nominate will be better than Obama.' "" Or, as Memphis Tea Party Chairman Mark Skoda told my colleague Kevin Bohn: ""The last perfect person I recall is Jesus. ... We have had the rhetoric. Now we want some steadiness."" To be sure, Skoda's openness to Romney is not a universal view. The co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, for instance, says, ""People in the movement are still pretty skeptical about Romney."" But, Jenny Beth Martin tells Bohn, ""If it comes down to Romney or Obama, come back and ask me."" OK, we will. But we already know the answer. So does this potential receptiveness to Romney dilute the tea party into an ineffective -- and unimportant -- movement? Not exactly.  Inevitably, new political movements do lose influence as they mature. They initially inject a huge amount of energy into the process, as the tea party did in the 2010 midterm elections. New political organizers and leaders are born. New issues are highlighted. But then comes the self-selection: The serious reformers remain. Those who can't accommodate political reality drop out of the process.  And wait for the next unelectable true believer to come along."
Doctor: Trump's alternate reality on health care,"Donald Trump might be suddenly making some noises in the direction of preserving parts of Obamacare, but let's be realistic.  There's every reason to believe that what we know as the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's central achievement, won't survive Trump's presidency. While President-elect Trump's campaign pledge to have Congress repeal Obamacare on day one isn't technically feasible, it's likely he'll largely dismantle this capstone progressive program, thanks to the supportive Republican Congress he'll enjoy (at least until the midterm elections).  While I fear greatly for my patients, this potential decision, while highly risky, could at least mean an end to the political gridlock surrounding health care that also represented a pressing threat to quality medicine.  Let me illustrate this: As someone who practiced medicine both before and after the ACA, I've witnessed its highs and its lows. I once treated a man who'd suffered a large brain bleed in a fall down a staircase. He struggled in the hospital through numerous complications over the course of months, and with our help, his family was able to apply for and receive commercial insurance coverage in his home state while he was still in the hospital.  This coverage, which they got over the Obamacare exchange, meant he was able to get the equipment and therapies he needed to successfully transition home with his family. This was miraculous because before Obamacare, he would have had to apply for Medicaid coverage, which would require becoming destitute if he was not already, and remaining poor if he hoped to keep coverage that he either could not get or could not afford on the private insurance market.  Conversely, a colleague of mine recently treated an entrepreneur who covered herself through an exchange policy while building her business. She thought she bought a quality plan, but when she suffered a spinal cord injury in a car accident that caused significant paralysis and necessitated prolonged rehabilitation, she found that her ACA plan capped her rehabilitation coverage at an arbitrary 30 days.  Now, limits on rehabilitation coverage aren't uncommon even in insurance plans outside the exchange, but they can sometimes be successfully appealed with proper documentation and when physicians lay out a good case to insurance medical directors. An appeal wasn't even possible with this low-quality insurance plan, which enforced an arbitrary, black and white, calendar-based cutoff, no matter how much clinical improvement was happening, or what the medical evidence supported.  The presidential campaign concluded with a lot of focus on health care, with headlines about large, upcoming premium increases attracting enormous attention. President Obama and Hillary Clinton never successfully communicated to the nation that they understood the problems with the ACA and were trying to improve it, but were repeatedly thwarted by Republicans in Congress. Too many voters got the impression Democrats considered the ACA to be flawless.  The final presidential debate also featured Trump's poor understanding of late-term abortion, reminding much of the electorate about the power the new president will have to select justices to the Supreme Court who will share his views.  Whatever voters intended in selecting Donald Trump, no one casting a ballot for him should have been unaware that he represents a radical change from the path that President Obama selected in forging the ACA and that Hillary Clinton wanted to continue.  After the election, one patient's mother expressed concerns to me about her son's ability to get health insurance in the future, if Obamacare were abolished, given that the injury that brought him into my care would be considered a pre-existing condition. This concern is adding stress to an already overwhelming situation, as she ponders whether an elective procedure should be done now or whether they should wait to see if the problem he's having now resolves on its own or becomes more problematic in the future, as we have advised.  Health care analysts have observed that unlike other elements of Obamacare that President Trump and his supportive Congress might easily drop through budget reconciliation (such as the exchanges), removing the ban on exclusions to pre-existing conditions requires passing legislation through the Senate.  Democratic senators could filibuster such repeal legislation, and Republicans don't have the 60 votes necessary to break that filibuster, but Republicans intent on killing the ban could simply change the Senate rules to prevent a filibuster in the first place.  They could also choose to attach repeal legislation to other essential legislation, forcing its passage.  What's more, the Trump administration would likely drop the Obama administration's appeal of House v. Burwell, meaning the federal district court ruling that exchange insurance subsidies aren't constitutional will stand.  But even without these possible maneuvers, if Trump kills the insurance exchanges, and along with them the subsidies necessary to make health care plans affordable, Obamacare is over. You cannot mandate that individuals purchase insurance they cannot afford, and you cannot force insurers to cover anyone who comes knocking if there isn't a mandate forcing plenty of healthy people to offset their costs by buying into the system.  As for a replacement for Obamacare, Trump was famously vague on the campaign trail about what he intends to do, other than declaring it will be awesome. There's a four-page policy brief on his campaign website, and the Trump administration's new transition website, GreatAgain.Gov, features a few bullet points.  But if, as he has threatened, he's going to get rid of every last vestige of the ACA, he would be ""protecting people's right"" to do something monumentally stupid: live life free of medical insurance coverage. As doctors like me know all too well, that plan works right up until the minute it doesn't.  Trump's policy wonks talk a lot about the wonder of the free market, and how, unshackled from the concerns of a conscientious government, insurance companies will see it in their best interest to offer affordable care to everyone. Trump believes in trickle-down health care.  He has alluded to allowing insurance companies to offer their plans across state lines, facilitating price comparisons among hospitals and doctors, letting you sock away money in health savings accounts that won't disappear, allowing you to share your HSA with your family and pass it on in your will, and letting you deduct the costs of health insurance from your taxes.  These are great moves for people who are making good incomes and can engage in that free market. But it's very similar to what we had before. Though some consumers will have more money in their pockets to shop, and they might have a few more choices while shopping, Trump has been adamant that he won't force insurers to sell to everyone.  And you would not be able to access this free market even if you're well off if you have a pre-existing condition. In the free market we had before Obamacare, insurers said ""no thanks"" to 1 in 5 potential customers because those customers had conditions insurers didn't want to cover.  In a sign of how unpredictable this presidency is going to be, while none of Trump's policy statements discuss preserving the pre-existing condition protections of the ACA, or the ability of parents to keep their children on their plans until age 26, Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that he's now supportive of keeping these provisions. President Obama managed to persuade Trump of their importance during their 90-minute meeting Thursday, a remarkable feat given that a year and a half of policy debates on the campaign trail did nothing.  In this,Trump is starting to sound a lot like the typical American voter, who supports individual provisions of the ACA but suddenly dislikes the law the minute it's revealed to be Obamacare. But how might a free marketeer like Trump force insurers to take on bad risks outside the ACA?  For that, we can look back to his previous policy statements. Instead of being able to shop around on the open market with your pre-tax dollars and your HSA account, you'll probably be relegated to something called a high-risk pool.The high risk pools were very limited state-based markets that feature high premiums. High risk pools require tax dollars to work, just like Obamacare, and the Trump administration would have to expand them enormously to make up for the loss of exchange plans.  They're quite simply a far more inefficient, inequitable and unaffordable way to do what the ACA has done.  Democrats will still be a factor in the next wave of health care reform, but Trump has every tool he needs to remove everything President Obama did and issue radically different policies. The ACA and Medicare were headed down a path of transforming hospitals and clinicians into money managers and quasi insurance companies that would need to weigh one patient's needs versus another's, and that trend concerned me enormously.  I don't think President Trump will continue that effort so vigorously, and that's something.  But I'm deeply worried that Trump's blind allegiance to unfettered capitalism won't mesh with quality medicine. The people he surrounds himself with will matter quite a lot, and so far he isn't distancing himself from the odd ducks who encircled him during his campaign. So I worry that somebody like Ben Carson as head of the Department of Health and Human Services would spend more effort on blocking access to care because of his extreme religious beliefs than finding efficiencies.  And don't get me started on green-coffee-bean-extract-swiller Surgeon General Mehmet Oz. After what's coming, we may all need a detox cleanse."
Why emergency rooms don't close the health care gap,"For decades, the attempts at health care reform have aimed to increase access. The United States is one of the few industrialized nations in the world that does not provide universal health care to its citizens. And repeatedly, those who oppose it have been forced to argue that access isn't the problem some make it out to be. Why? The emergency department, they say. After all, it is a commonly held belief that no one can be denied care there. So -- in essence -- everyone can get free health care if they need it. We have a universal system after all. That, of course, is not true. It's not even close. Let's start with the idea that emergency rooms must provide you care.  What's important to remember is that you can't be refused emergency care. That's because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires that any hospital that takes Medicare or Medicaid must check you for emergent conditions and treat them if they exist. Since nearly every hospital in the country takes federal funds from one of these programs, nearly all hospitals are subject to EMTALA. But ""emergency medical condition"" has a pretty narrow definition. It includes active labor for women and acute conditions that would cause death, serious bodily organ harm or serious bodily function impairment if they were not treated right away. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter and Facebook.com/cnnopinion. If politicians are meaning to say that women have universal access to delivery care, then I suppose there's an element of truth to that. But there's no guarantee of prenatal care in the emergency department. If they are saying that we have universal access if we're acutely having a heart attack, then I suppose there's truth to that as well. But there's no such access for lipid panels, stress tests or prescriptions for cholesterol medications that might help you avoid the heart attack in the first place.  If you're acutely obstructed by massively advanced colon cancer, it's likely you can get emergency surgery to end the blockage. But your cancer is likely too far advanced to cure at that point. Moreover, you're not going to get chemotherapy in the emergency department nor could you have gotten the colonoscopy that might have detected the cancer far earlier. You can't get preventive care in the emergency department. You can't get screened for a host of disorders. You can't get treatment for your depression there or really for any chronic mental disorders. You can't get help with your child's autism, ADHD or developmental delay. And even if you could, it wouldn't be free. That's the second and perhaps more misunderstood part of this emergency department misconception. The costs of treatment in the emergency room are not quickly dismissed or written off. You'll get that emergent care, but you'll also be charged for it.  And hospitals aren't going to let that go easily. A recent article in the New York Times detailed how Accretive Health, a medical debt collector, is using aggressive tactics such as confronting patients in their hospital beds to collect the money owed for even emergent care. The article also describes how collection agencies have long been used to go after patients after they've left the treatment facility. In some cases, patients were even confronted and stalled by debt collectors as they entered the emergency department on some later occasion so that the company could collect on old bills before more care was offered. An even more recent story covered by Kaiser Health News and NPR reported on a family of four sued by its local nonprofit hospital. The family earned about $25,000 a year -- below the poverty line -- but the parents did not qualify for Medicaid in Ohio. It seems that the hospital had sued almost 1,600 people for unpaid medical bills from 2009 to 2011. Further, the piece reported, ""[w]hile Ohio has a law that prevents foreclosures based on medical debt alone, it is legal for hospitals to garnish patient wages, attach bank accounts and get a lien on any future earnings, including from the sale of a house."" It might even be worse in North Carolina, where a group of nonprofit hospitals sued 40,000 patients from 2005 to 2010. This is problematic because nonprofit hospitals are supposed to provide a certain level of charity care in exchange for their tax-exempt status. A recent review found that three hospitals in Illinois were providing a very small amount of care for free or at discounted rates. This has led to a number of facilities losing their nonprofit status and legislators to try to pass new laws requiring specify charity care minimums for nonprofit status. Before you get all riled up, I understand that hospitals need money to run. The American Hospital Association reports that hospitals lost upward of $40 billion in unpaid bills in 2010 alone. I'm not suggesting care should be given out freely or that hospitals should be forced to operate at a loss. But let's acknowledge that patients will be held accountable for the costs of their care, even in the emergency room. If they can't pay those bills, their credit can be ruined. Medical bills are a very significant cause of bankruptcy in this country. So it's true that an emergency room won't let you die if you show up at the door, but short of that, you can't get care for a host of medical issues. And, while they will provide that lifesaving care to you even if you have no insurance and no money, they will send you a bill. And if you can't pay, it may cause you, and your family, financial ruin.  That's a far cry from universal health care, and nothing to brag about.

Nuns' Obamacare challenge and the right,"""The Little Sisters do incredible work in the world and this case ... has brought their work to light.""  That's NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue on Fox News, discussing (and disputing) the lawsuit brought on behalf of The Little Sisters of the Poor, a religiously affiliated, nonprofit charitable organization challenging the exemption procedures under Obamacare's contraception mandate.   And Hogue is right: The sisters, admirably, run nursing homes across the country. But the lawsuit brought in their name at the very least is, as The New York Times editorial board wrote, ""an unjustified attempt by an employer to impose its religious views on workers"" and at worst a wrongheaded co-optation of the notion of religious liberty.  Either way, it certainly fits with the ongoing conservative partisan agenda to unravel the Affordable Care Act The Little Sisters of the Poor order, based in Colorado, is already exempt from Obamacare's requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans cover the cost of contraception without a co-pay as part of ensuring comprehensive preventative health care for women. To claim that exemption, the Little Sisters simply have to sign a short form stating their religious exemption to contraception. That's it.   This is not about the nuns having to cover contraception. This is about a piece of paper. In essence, the plaintiffs in the case are arguing, as Amanda Marcotte of Slate has pointed out, that filling out a form is a violation of their religious freedom. Sound a bit far-fetched? Indeed, that's what a federal judge and two appellate courts have already ruled.   And yet the case, and the ongoing conservative opposition to the contraception mandate, continues on. Late last month, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor surprisingly gave the nuns a temporary reprieve, blocking the requirement until the merits of the case can be considered Certainly conservatives aren't pursuing attacking the contraception mandate to win a popularity contest.  Data show that 98% of sexually experienced Catholic women of child-bearing age have used a method of contraception other than natural family planning at some point in their lives and that 82% of Catholics -- and 89% of Americans overall -- say that contraception use is morally acceptable.   Even so, conservatives grasping for any threads to try and unravel health care reform turned their ire on this portion of the Affordable Care Act But the administration has already amended the law to address the objections of religious conservatives -- mainly, it should be noted, Catholics, as it was the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops that helped lead the push against the contraception mandate.   The Obama administration exempted all religious organizations, including churches, from the mandate.  And the administration created the exemption for religiously affiliated nonprofit organizations that object to birth control.  In signing a simple self-certifying waver, these nonprofits alert their insurance companies or third-party administrator to their objection, and that company then provides contraceptive coverage at no charge to women who work at the nonprofit. The Little Sister's counsel argue that signing the exemption form is still tacitly facilitating the provision of contraception through the nonprofit's insurer.  Except it's not.   As Michael Hiltzik points out in the Los Angeles Times, ""The sisters' insurer [Christian Brothers Employee Benefits Trust] is also exempt from the mandate, because the health plan isn't governed by ERISA, the federal law under which the mandate is imposed. In other words, signing the form doesn't lead to contraceptive services either."" So one can't help but wonder what's really motivating the lawsuit.  The Little Sisters are being represented by a religiously affiliated legal group pushing a broader conservative agenda to dismantle Obamacare.  While the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty has pursued a handful of bipartisan cases, the majority of its lawsuits hew to the agenda of the religious right. It's an agenda to which the Becket Fund is tied ideologically and financially, the monitoring organization Political Research Associates has noted.  In addition to Catholic Church-affiliated backers, the Becket Fund enjoys major support from ideologically driven conservative foundations, such as the Bradley Foundation, whose other grantees include the Heritage Foundation and the Hudson Institute, partisan institutions leading the conservative fight against Obamacare.  Note the Becket Fund is also the source of the attorneys behind the Hobby Lobby case in which a private corporation that willingly opts to receive special, favorable government treatment under that status  is nonetheless alleging it should also qualify as a religious entity for purposes of exemption from the health care law's contraception mandate. Here's the thing:  No one is saying that the Little Sisters of the Poor should have to pay for contraception for their employees. There's an exemption under Obamacare. For which the nuns qualify. If only they would sign the form.   In other words, the law already works for groups like the Little Sisters. They don't want to fund contraception coverage and, under Obamacare, they don't have to.     Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion."
Who's behind GOP's stunning defeat on health care?,"Monday night, two Republican Senators -- Mike Lee and Jerry Moran -- announced that they would not vote to send the health care bill to the floor. The announcement marked a stunning defeat for a Republican Party that controls the White House and Congress and which has made this item the top priority for years. Not only is health care reform in limbo, but going into the end of July, Republicans don't have a single major piece of legislation to show for President Donald Trump's first six months of office. As the blame game now begins, everyone in Washington will be asking -- who killed the health bill? As in an Agatha Christie novel, there are many suspects on the train. The bill itself This was the main problem. Republicans crafted a piece of legislation that faced immense odds. At the same time that the legislation aimed to dismantle a major piece of the social safety net, it offered nothing much in return to the millions of Americans who were going to lose benefits. The legislation threatened to strip away benefits from millions of poor, elderly, and sick Americans.  The early versions of the bill offered a huge tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. And even after that was stripped out in the revised bill, the legislation was seen as punitive and was opposed by governors from both parties, major players in the health care industry as well as a large majority of Americans who continued to register their strong opposition. Each CBO score -- the Congressional Budget Office's assessment of the likely impact of the bill -- was a reminder of what would happen if Congress said yes. The Republicans managed to put forth a bill that had very few fans -- but many victims.     President Trump As the President would say of others, he proved to be a ""disaster,"" making things more difficult for the GOP  every step of the way. The chaos that is coming from his White House and the ongoing investigation into Russia -- which he and his advisers have done little to stop, only adding fuel to the fire -- didn't help Republicans keep a focus on this fight. When President Trump, who now has a historically low approval rate of 36% did say something -- like calling the House bill ""mean"" soon after passage and saying he was fine if nothing passed after the first round of Senate efforts fell apart -- he usually hurt the Republican cause. He proved unwilling or unable to use the bully pulpit of the White House to build public support for the legislation and make a convincing case to Americans that this bill was anything other than hurtful. When Republican Senator Dean Heller of Nevada expressed his strong reservations, a pro-Trump Super Pac threatened to run ads against him.      Trump's response to Monday night's news came in a tweet: ""Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join!"" Once again, the President is not listening. Democrats might work with Republicans to fix the problems with ACA. But they won't agree to eliminate the program -- which would still mean millions of Americans losing their benefits -- based on a promise from a President, who faces a credibility gap bigger than the Grand Canyon, that the GOP will somehow make things better down the line.   The Freedom Caucus This bill has its origins in a Freedom Caucus that had pushed the Republicans far to the right in the House. The Freedom Caucus insisted on an extremely conservative measure to kick off this period of Republican government. Sen. Mitch McConnell always had an eye back on the House where he knew that he had little wiggle room. If he did anything to address the concerns of moderates like Susan Collins about the fate of Medicaid, he would never be able to negotiate a compromise in conference committee. Freedom Caucus allies in the Senate such as Ted Cruz could not be bought off with anything short of removing strong regulatory protections, as was evident when McConnell caved to the senator before announcing the second version of the bill.    Sen. Mitch McConnell When the Senate deliberations started, everyone predicted that McConnell was a master legislator, Lyndon Johnson style, who would figure out a way to get this done. They were wrong. The truth is that McConnell has spent much of his career as an obstructionist. He is extraordinarily good at stopping things, but not really tested in making legislation happen. In his first major test in his new role, he didn't have the legislative wherewithal to put these votes together. Facing a challenge with this unpopular bill, he stumbled and fumbled. It turned out that he didn't have some magic trick up his sleeve to bring the votes together. His lack of a strong television presence hurt, particularly given that we have a president who did so little to sell the bill to the public. Everyone was working in the backroom on a bill that sounded horrible to most Americans. After the collapse of his bill Monday night, McConnell announced his Hail Mary plan. He is going to give this one more try. Listening to the President, he announced that the Senate would move to repeal Obamacare with a two-year delay to allow time for a transition to a ""patient-centered health care system."" Perhaps the gambit will work, and Republican senators will take a risk on a proposal that will be just as unpopular with the public. But given the opposition to cutting the Medicaid expansion and the patient protections, that is a dicey proposition. The Congressional Democrats The opposition on Capitol Hill played this well. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer kept their troops in line. There were no major defections from the Democrats at any point. In the Senate, this meant that McConnell could only lose two votes if he wanted the bill to pass. The Senate Democrats were also consistently on message, pointing out the many threats posed by the legislation and the reasons it would undercut health care markets. Yet they did this without becoming the story. Although Republicans would have loved to turn this into a tale of partisan Democratic obstruction, they failed. Democrats let the Republicans make their own mistakes -- and let the bill speak for itself.     The grassroots resisters Since President Trump took office, opponents have been mobilizing at the grassroots. A group of former congressional staffers, for instance, formed the group Indivisible which used the methods of the tea party to create pressure on Republicans in Congress to vote no on repeal and replace. They flooded town halls, spoke to the media, called and emailed congressional offices and appeared at public events to make their case known. The strategy worked. They have been incredibly effective throughout at generating fear among congressional Republicans and making it clear that there would be high costs to voting in favor of this bill. The irony is that the failure of the Senate bill could be the best thing to happen to Republicans. This stops them from passing legislation that could easily cause a massive backlash and creates an opportunity for moving forward with measures more attractive to their supporters, like tax cuts. But that all assumes that the dysfunction we have seen from this White House and the rightward pressure coming from within the party come to an end. The odds are that those won't. If that's the case, the defeat of health care might portend more legislative failures."
Syria highlights Trump's credibility challenge -- and opportunity,"With the cruise missile attack on a Syrian airbase, President Trump has turned the national conversation away from the Russia scandal and White House infighting. He now has in front of him the possibility of making progress on one of the most vexing problems in foreign policy. Unlike on many issues, much of world opinion seems to be on Trump's side. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad ""carries responsibility for these developments,"" declared French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a joint statement.  But launching missiles is the just a first step. What comes next will really test the mettle of this administration as the responses from all the parties to the Syrian civil war and the larger political situation surrounding it starts to take shape. And there are many questions about whether Trump is up to the job of helping to solve Syria's crisis. The President now faces the kind of test that confronted earlier presidents, some of whom demonstrated the ability to respond with confidence, with gravitas, and with the right mix of diplomacy and militarism.  Leaders who set an example The White House legends, like Franklin Roosevelt after Pearl Harbor in 1941 or John F. Kennedy with the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 or Ronald Reagan with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987, demonstrated this resolve. In all of these cases the credibility of the president with the public and with international leaders was essential to their success.  President Roosevelt had demonstrated since his election in 1932 his ability to be an effective president who built a strong political coalition within the United States and who had slowly guided the nation toward a more internationalist posture despite the persistence of isolationism in Congress.  Despite the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Kennedy by 1962 had proven himself to be an intelligent and thoughtful commander in chief who displayed a strong sense of the various policy issues facing the nation and who had a steely demeanor that helped him navigate the political challenges that he faced.  When the hawkish Reagan met with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev over a series of summits, he showed the right balance of being able to concede on issues that were risky with his political base at home while maintaining a firm posture so that he could ultimately sell his historic arms agreement with our adversary to the Congress back home.  By the time of the final meeting with Gorbachev, who came to Washington ready to make a deal, Reagan had survived the Iran-Contra scandal and rebuilt public support.  Politically, Reagan could still rally most of the Republican Party, and even a fair number of Democrats, when push came to shove. For leaders of other countries, this matters.   Keeping promises A key indicator of presidential credibility lies in whether politicians and foreign leaders believe that the commander in chief will move forward with threats and keep key promises. Adversaries and supporters need to have confidence that a president can carefully handle the difficult moments of being a leader, particularly in crises.  Other political leaders need to have some confidence that they can predict what a president will do and how he or she will act in the near future. Going into the Syria strike, Trump did not have this same kind of credibility.   The attack brings to mind some of the ""Wag the Dog"" questions that arose when President Bill Clinton used missiles in the middle of the Monica Lewinsky scandal,  with ""Wag the Dog"" a reference to the film with Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman where an administration manufactured a war to distract attention from a scandal. During the campaign and during the course of the First Hundred Days,Trump has repeatedly undermined his own efforts to strengthen the perception that voters and heads of other nations have about his presidency.  Thus far, he has run a presidency aimed to appeal primarily to his base of supporters.  His actions and statements have done almost nothing, as is evident through his historically low approval polls, to give others confidence in his ability to deliver. The constant tweet storms attacking his opponents have created the impression of a president who in the early morning hours is out of control and willing to make provocative, and false, statements without consideration of the consequences. He has repeatedly threatened his adversaries, including China, without actually following through on his remarks.  Long-term planning With Syria, there are doubts about whether Trump has any kind of a long-term plan other than to be reactive. After the strikes, strong and thoughtful diplomatic moves will be essential to making sure this does not disintegrate into even more brutal violence. As a former Obama administration official, Antony Blinken, wrote in The New York Times, the administration ""must prevent or mitigate the possible unintended consequences of using force, including complicating the military campaign against the Islamic State. All this will require something in which the administration has shown little interest: smart diplomacy.""  He will also need to build a durable base of political support for whatever steps he takes. The failure of health care reform, and the empty legislative basket from his Hundred Days suggest that he doesn't really have the ability to move members of Congress on issues that he considers to be urgent.  The failure to staff key agencies like State Department and the laggard manner in which Trump handled the transition period suggests that this is a president whose own executive branch is not even all ready to go. And the ongoing scandal over Russia's role in  the 2016 election has left a massive dark cloud hovering over the White House.  All of these problems add up. Heads of state and the leaders of terrorist organizations are no doubt thinking about how President Trump will handle these difficult situations. Foreign leaders will ask how much they can trust him to deal with crises and negotiations with the kind of caution and poise that international relations require. They will wonder whether they should take seriously his threats -- from economic sanctions to military action. President Trump likes to think that he is his own man and that he can continue to do things the way he wants to without listening to the so-called establishment whose rules and norms he finds to be irrelevant.  That might work in the realm of reality television but it's a dangerous path when it comes to international relations and national security. The President needs to have a certain amount of credibility — credibility that he can handle tough situations without causing more chaos, credibility that he has a strong base of political support that will allow him to gain the backing he needs when taking on controversial matters and the credibility to deliver on the threats and promises that he issues when engaging with the world.  Trump needs to address his credibility challenges to make progress in Syria and to further US interests around the world."
317 million reasons to love Obamacare,"More than 6 million Americans signed up for Obamacare before the March 31 deadline to get private health insurance through the Affordable Care Act exchanges. This is great news for the Obama administration.   But there are millions more reasons to celebrate Obamacare. Actually, at the writing of this essay, there are more than 317 million reasons — because that's the population of the United States of America and every single one of us can benefit from health care reform.  How?  Here's a rundown by the numbers: 3.1 million     That's how many young adults can get coverage because of the provision in Obamacare that allows them to stay on their parents' insurance plans until age 26.  105 million    That's how many Americans no longer have lifetime expense caps, whether it's because they have chronic illnesses or because their insurance company set restrictive policies.   6.1 million    That's how many Americans with Medicare Part D no longer have to go through the ""doughnut hole"" coverage gap. This means seniors can save more than $5.7 billion on prescription drugs. 3.2 million       That's the number of small businesses estimated to be eligible for tax credits for providing health insurance to their 19.3 million employees nationwide, credits worth $15.4 billion in 2011 alone. 4.4 million       That's how many low-income adults will now have access to health insurance thanks to states implementing the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare; an additional 5.8 million poor adults would be included in this count if 25 mostly Republican-led states weren't refusing Medicaid expansion. 50 to 129 million That's how many people will benefit from the Obamacare provision that eliminates all bars for coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Studies say that anywhere from 19% to 50% of non-elderly Americans have health conditions that could qualify as pre-existing conditions.   49.4 million     That's how many current Medicare enrollees can feel secure knowing that, under Obamacare, existing Medicare benefits can neither be reduced nor taken away. 317 million -- That's how many Americans — i.e., all of us — potentially benefit from the requirement that insurance companies provide flu shots, HIV screenings, prostate exams, mammograms and FDA-approved contraception for free, without a co-pay.  -- Plus, we all benefit from new requirements that insurance companies must spend at least 80% of our premium dollars on our health care as opposed to marketing or administration.         -- We all benefit from the new requirement that insurance companies publicly justify their actions if they want to raise premiums by 10% or more.  -- We all benefit from knowing that our insurance can now never be capped or canceled at the whim of insurance companies.    As high quality care is maintained while costs may go down because of improved coverage and access, we all benefit from a more affordable and effective health care system.   What about, you ask, the estimated 4.7 million Americans who lost their current insurance plans during the rollout of Obamacare?  Well, according to a congressional report, 2.35 million or so can take advantage of the Obama administration's decision to grandfather those plans through 2014.   Another 1.4 million qualify for Medicaid expansion or subsidies in the Obamacare exchanges.  On top of that, the Obama administration has agreed that a ""hardship exemption"" built into health care reform for any American facing major challenges in complying with the law would be interpreted to include those whose policies had been canceled.  In other words, they won't be penalized.   When Republicans rolled out stories of alleged Obamacare victims, the details were usually debunked in some way. The truth is that many of the canceled plans were no longer legal under Obamacare because they neither covered the basic things insurance should cover or, worse, were dangerously designed to explode the minute the insured got sick: what Consumer Reports has called ""junk insurance.""   Arguing that people should be able to keep these plans is like arguing that people should still be allowed to drive defective Chevy Cobalts or cars without seat belts.  Like it or not, the government's job is to help keep us safe and insurance companies that were peddling shoddy products were doing the opposite.   Polls show most Americans want to keep Obamacare and work to fix it rather than replace or get rid of health care reform altogether.  And there's much to suggest support for Obamacare would be even higher were it not for constant Republican attacks and misinformation about the law.   After all, when Americans find out what specific provisions are included in Obamacare, they overwhelmingly support them. Eighty percent support the extension of dependent coverage, 79% support closing the Medicare ""doughnut hole,"" 77% support eliminating out-of-pocket costs for preventive services, 74% support the expansion of Medicaid.  These Obamacare components are even supported by a majority of Republicans.   And it's still early. As more Americans access private health insurance choices through the exchange marketplace,  receive care minus the discrimination and dirty tricks that insurance companies could get away with in the past, we'll see more people getting the medicine they need, screened for cancer sooner in more treatable stages and pay less for good care.   Every day, as we all see the benefits of health care reform in our lives, support for Obamacare will grow stronger. Before long, not even the most partisan Republicans will be able to attack it.

Obama defeated by his own bureaucracy,"When Barack Obama was a newbie president, there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead. Government should be seen as a force for good, not evil. Sure, he told us, it needed to be ""smarter and better,"" but that could—and would—happen under his watch.  Never mind that Bill Clinton spent years ""reinventing government"" with mixed success. Or that only 2% of the American public believes that government can be trusted to do the right thing all the time. President Obama was convinced he could change all that with programs that would deliver for America—such as health care reform—and the public would be grateful. Instead, the President is living his own version of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"": staring down a rabbit hole of government bureaucracy and inefficiency. The government he has studiously tried to grow, manage and change has become his own personal nemesis. All of which makes you wonder: Does the President himself trust government anymore? The scandal at the Department of Veterans Affairs is just the latest in a slew of bureaucratic messes that strike at the core power point of the Obama presidency: Making government work. Consider the disastrous health care website rollout. The IRS controversy. Even the question of NSA surveillance raises questions about the role of government: Did the civil libertarian Obama allow spies to run amok?  The President is clearly having a running debate with himself over all this. About a year ago, after the NSA program was revealed and Democrats and libertarians started squawking, Obama seemed more than a tad defensive on government spying.  ""If people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress ... to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution ..."" he said, ""then we're going to have some problems here."" Indeed.  These are not trivial matters. Health care is the signature legislative achievement of the administration, and a botched rollout made it smell bad at the start. Fixing the VA—and aiding veterans—is a cornerstone of the Obama presidency. And yet, it all looks as if somehow the bureaucracy has beaten the boss.  It's a management issue. So far as I can tell, the governing style of this administration has two extremes: issues singled out for micromanagement (as in, foreign policy, from the West Wing) and issues completely delegated (as in, VA management). What seems to be  missing is the in-between: the continual monitoring and early warning system that avoids presidential blindsiding. That's the area in which most of the business of government actually gets done.  And it can get done. The apparatus to do the nation's business in a competent way is there. Use it, and manage it. That's what chief executives are hired to do.  Government is unwieldy and difficult and hard to tame, sure. But if your presidency is based, in large part, on telling Americans that government can work for them--which it can--you need to make it work. It's not that the President is a hopeless manager. He does very well when he leads a hierarchical organization with a single goal, like a presidential bid. He's top dog, he's not negotiating with anybody, and he's not trying to get people to do things they don't want to do. In a campaign, for instance, they all want to elect the same person: him. But when you have to negotiate—or lead—people not related to you, or not indebted to you or who don't agree with you, it's a different story. Managing or negotiating with people with mixed motives (Congress, anyone?) is not an Obama strong point.  By nature, bureaucracies are hard to trust and even harder to tame.  And if a chief executive isn't careful, it's an energy-sapping (and legacy endangering) vortex that sucks you right in. Just ask Obama, who was government's best friend.  Does he still feel that way today? Hard to know. But my guess is he's a bit like Alice in Wonderland. ""I can't go back to yesterday,"" she said, ""because I was a different person then.""

"Like it or not, the Republicans own President Trump","More and more Republicans are becoming openly critical of President Trump. The GOP congressional delegations who control the House and Senate headed home last week without any major legislation to show for their first six months of united government and Trump himself went on vacation.    In recent weeks, we've seen Sen. John McCain defy the President by sinking the effort to repeal Obamacare. Sen. Lindsey Graham warned Trump to back off his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions or it would be the beginning of the end of his presidency. Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake published a new book lambasting Republicans for remaining silent as they watch the dysfunction of this administration play out in real time. People are already speculating about potential primary challengers to Trump, should he run for reelection in 2020.    And a growing number of conservative pundits feel comfortable expressing doubts about President Trump, even in the conservative holy land of Fox News.  But this is not an easy stance for Republicans. In fact, they own President Trump. They can try to disassociate themselves from him, but they and their party are as culpable as anyone for creating a path in American politics that allowed him to win election and to govern in the way that he does. He is in fact a Republican, given what the party has become, and is not some maverick who has stolen away the party. It wasn't that he outwitted the Republican establishment, it's that the Republican establishment has changed. To understand the roots of President Trump, it is vital to remember that the Republican Party thus far has generally stood behind him and his agenda. Evangelical voters entered into a Faustian bargain with their support for a candidate who personally seems to be the antithesis of everything that their movement supports.  Despite all his controversial positions and statements, Trump performed very well in most red states during the election and polls show that he continues to hold pretty strong support in the Republican electorate. A Quinnipiac poll shows that 76% of Republicans approve of the President. Those numbers have dropped but they are not nearly as low as one might expect given what we are seeing in national polls where Donald Trump is unpopular, untrusted, and essentially unacceptable to Democrats and many independents as President of the United States.   Many Republican legislators have been reluctant to tackle the Russia problem, while only a handful of Republicans actually voted ""no"" on the health care bill despite all the fireworks about the revolt of the moderate three in the Senate. A surprising number of House Republicans outside the Freedom Caucus voted in support of an extraordinarily conservative bill. As Jennifer Senior wrote in her New York Times review of Sen. Flake's new book: ""But Flake has also cast most of his votes in favor of Trump's policies.""  Almost no Republicans have objected to the extreme measures that President Trump has been pursuing through executive action, such as rolling back regulations to curb climate change or ramping up border security.  There was little pushback when the President responded to his week of crisis by supporting legislation to severely cut down on immigration and ""joked"" about wanting more police brutality, all of which were meant to be part of what amounted to ""Don't Worry, I'm a Conservative Republican Week."" The President has made clear his intention of trying to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, manna from heaven for keepers of Ronald Reagan's supply-side legacy.  From Newt Gingrich's election as House Speaker in the wake of the 1994 midterms through the emergence of the tea party, the Republicans have steadily shifted to the right on public policy and adopted an aggressive, do-what-it-takes style to governance that laid the groundwork for the Trump presidency.  On immigration, voting rights, tax policy, climate change and more, the GOP traveled farther from the median voter and President Trump has stood right by their side. The health care reform the President supported came directly out of the Freedom Caucus agenda -- and failed when more Americans learned from Congressional Budget Office analyses how draconian the cuts in their health care coverage would be. President Trump's vulgar language and zealous rejection of fact-based analysis of the issues (such as voter fraud or climate change, for example) comes directly out of the conservative media universe that have been peddling this style of political discourse for some time now. We know that Trump likes Alex Jones and Fox & Friends, while his senior advisor Stephen Bannon helped to make Breitbart.com what it is today.  Conservative pundits have been challenging mainstream expertise on issues such as climate change for a long time. On the airwaves, it is common to see hosts and reporters vilify Democrats, and Republicans who are too centrist, with discussions of conspiratorial accusations such as birtherism that receive treatment as though they are mainstream news. Older listeners who remember Bob Grant's fierce talk radio shows will recognize some of the lineage of Trump's most pointed statements.  While some Republicans certainly distance themselves from these elements of the media, in reality much of the party has relied on this aspect of their world as a foundation for party power. Figures such as Rush Limbaugh have been deeply embedded among top Republicans for decades.  And the alliances that President Trump has made with extremist elements in the electorate are nothing new. The so-called ""base"" of President Trump's support was already becoming a bigger part of the Republican Party back in 2008 when Senator McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to join him as his running mate.  In a revealing film, Right America: Feeling Wronged, the documentarian Alexandra Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi's daughter) captured the mood at McCain-Palin rallies in 2008 which was almost exactly like what we saw at Trump-Pence rallies during the 2016 campaign. The movie shows voters at campaign rallies, holding up signs that read ""Country First,"" railing against a media that they believed was stacked for the Democrats and forecasting how an Obama presidency would lead to the end of civilization. The historian Rick Perlstein has shown how important this underside of Republican politics has been since the 1960s.  If Republicans really become dissatisfied with President Trump and what he stands for, they will have to take a deep dive into their own history and reckon with it. Otherwise, any effort to cleanse the party of President Trump's impact won't really work. Republicans will find themselves in the same place come 2020."
"GOP, to govern you need to make friends with Democrats","This was far more than a routine legislative flub. It is a warning to congressional Republicans and the Trump White House. The embarrassing collapse of the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act makes clear the limits of the GOP's unwise, unworkable insistence on shutting Democrats out of lawmaking. The refusal to move any piece of legislation forward without Democratic votes will bedevil Ryan and Trump as they attempt to rewrite the tax codes, immigration laws and the nation's multi-trillion-dollar budget. For decades, success in Congress depended on an alliance between Republicans and conservative, so-called Blue Dog Democrats. The result was a string of centrist deals that marginalized ultra-liberal and super conservative members and allowed legislation to move forward. That system broke down in the 1990s. Election after election, conservative Democrats got wiped out in the South, while liberal Republicans were rendered extinct in New England and other Northeastern districts.  But having more conservatives in the GOP conference doesn't always help the party get things done. By making every vote a matter of securing a near-unanimous Republican majority -- and by shunning any possibility of working with conservative Democrats on select issues -- Ryan, like his predecessor, John Boehner, has placed himself in thrall to the most hard-line conservatives in his conference, the so-called Freedom Caucus. The parliamentary math is brutally simple. Ryan's self-imposed requirement to pass legislation by relying exclusively on Republicans means that any group of 23 or more GOP members can hamstring the speaker by denying him a majority -- or threatening to do so, an effective power play in its own right.  And that is precisely what the Freedom Caucus, a loose collection of 30 to 40 ultra-conservatives, has chosen to do. Prominent members of the caucus defected from the Ryan bill, with one, Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, calling the Ryan bill ""the largest welfare program ever proposed"" by Republicans and calling for Congress to simply eliminate Obamacare with no replacement.  ""It's not a repeal. It's a marketing ploy,"" he said of the Ryan bill.  While Brooks and other hard-liners were threatening to jump ship unless Obamacare was eliminated, powerful moderate Republicans like Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, chair of the Appropriations Committee, wanted to keep some protections in for the most vulnerable of his constituents.  ""Unfortunately, the legislation before the House today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in New Jersey,"" Frelinghuysen said shortly before the vote, explaining why he could not support it. Trump and Ryan say they have no plans to revive health care reform anytime soon. But as they move on to other topics, they should remember the health care debacle -- and the folly of putting their agenda at the mercy of extremists."
The Buffett Rule and the meaning of fairness,"On Monday, I signed an online petition standing with President Obama, Warren Buffett and others to urge Congress to pass the Buffett Rule. It was a small gesture to stand for what is fair.   The Buffett Rule, simply stated, requires the wealthiest Americans to pay taxes at rates not less than rates paid by middle-income Americans.  Current loopholes that allow millionaires and billionaires to have unfairly low tax rates would be closed. It's only fair. So much has happened this year to focus our attention on what is fair: Obama's State of the Union address, the Trayvon Martin case, the rhetoric around the Supreme Court's review of the Affordable Care Act and Paul Ryan's proposed budget, with its cuts to services to middle- and low-income Americans.  What has happened to the concept of fairness?  I'll tell you: It's been retooled.   No longer is it defined as my parents taught me.  I hear their voices saying, ""Play fair,"" ""Share (my toys) and play fair,""  ""Don't cheat.  Play fair.""  ""You'll have your turn at bat, play fair.""  ""Don't fight, play fair.""  ""Win fair.""   Even in the midst of segregation, with its pervasive lack of fairness on every front, they never wavered in their lessons about fairness.  More important, there was clarity of meaning.   Fairness was at the heart of being a good person.  Fairness was about how I related to others, combined with how others related to me.  Fairness was not one-sided.   In my early 30s, I worked for someone who said, ""Fair is when I win.""  It was his attempt to clarify inherent complexities in the term ""fair."" It was then I awakened to a definition of ""fair"" I had not known, definition in which the individual determined fairness by how the situation affected him and him alone.  Fair had been retooled.  Its meaning had shifted. In this year's State of the Union message, Obama said, ""We can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot and everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules."" I know what those words mean to me.  I now know they may mean something very different to others.   Some heard the same words and thought, ""Fair is when I win.""  How else can we explain the person who got his job because of personal or family connections, now protesting another person getting a job because of government or corporate initiatives?  How else can we explain cuts or freezes in salaries for workers and huge pay raises and bonuses for top executives?  How else can we explain board members approving such bonuses, saying ""it's only fair""?  How else can we explain how those with the most financial resources pay the lowest tax rates?  Fair? Over my 60-plus years of living, I have been close to people of varied socioeconomic levels and life experiences.  The differences are often striking.   Take health care.  I was working as a corporate executive during the developmental stages of H.R. 3962, the Affordable Care Act, currently under review by the Supreme Court.   There, I was with my peers in our good jobs with comprehensive health insurance.  Some were indifferent to health care reform, while others were vehemently against it.   For me, it was personal.  Affordable, accessible, quality health care for every person was only fair.  Was it ""only fair"" because I had more personal contact with poor people or sick people or people without health insurance?  Was it ""only fair"" because I knew the challenges and outrageous costs faced by my mother, who struggled with multiple sclerosis, or my sister, who has sarcoidosis?  Perhaps.  But still today, as a retiree, I think it only fair.  My peers, for the most part, were good people.  Yet there were times I thought their attitudes and actions most unfair.    It really scares me that ""fair,"" as I know it, may have gone for good. The bright flames of innovation, hard work, and individual and collective achievement are snuffed out when people feel that they do not have a fair shot.  Snuffed out when rules change to fit the whims of those in power.  Snuffed out because people stop trying and give up on their dreams.  As a teenager, I fell in love with the writings of the brilliant poet Langston Hughes (1902-67).  In his ""Dream Deferred,"" he asked:  ""What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore -- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over -- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?""  God grant me strength to fight for what is fair.  Follow us on Twitter: @CNNOpinion  Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion"
Why the f*** are you talking s*** with kids in the room?,"We've reached a major tipping point in politics and there's no turning back. Welcome to the Swear Zone. Remember the good old days, when decorum was still intact? The days where without a hot mic we never would have heard George W. Bush call a reporter a ""major-league asshole"" or Joe Biden's aside to Barack Obama that passing health care reform was ""a big fucking deal.""   Those days are over.  Politics are not only wildly unpredictable, they're NSFWAF. Blame Donald Trump for taking us to new lows, but here's something new: the Democrats are jumping deep in the mud with him.  Last weekend, for example, with children on stage behind him, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez leaned right into a microphone and told an audience in Las Vegas that Trump ""doesn't give a shit about health care."" In Portland, Maine, Perez said, ""They call it a skinny budget, I call it a shitty budget."" Earlier this month the DNC began selling a t-shirt that read, ""Democrats give a shit about people.""  New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand appeared to agree: Of her Congressional cohort she told New York magazine ""If we're not helping people, we should go the fuck home."" Nice. I consider myself an expert at swearing. I love a good F-bomb. But we have a problem here. All good swearers know -- the art of swearing is knowing the time, use and place.  A spokeswoman for the DNC, Xochitli Hinojosa offered this explanation for their chairman, ""Tom is angry, and he's angry because Donald Trump continues to stick it to the American people.""  I have a different explanation -- politicians are swearing more because it works. There's science that suggests why.  A team of researchers from the United States, Netherlands, the UK and Hong Kong found that people who use profanity are less likely to be associated by others with lying and deception.  University of California, San Diego, professor Benjamin Bergen's research on profanity shows that this perceived honesty has a neurological basis. The brain's language center is in the left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex but swearing is controlled by the limbic system -- which is the part of the brain that processes emotions.  What does that mean? It means, when you swear, other people process it in the emotion center of the brain so you don't sound so ""scripted"" and that makes you seem more authentic and passionate about what you're saying. And there's yet another benefit to swearing. Author, Michael Adams argues that it can help you bond with people. In his book, ""In Praise of Profanity"" he writes that swearers ""are unexpectedly useful in fostering human relations because they carry risk ... We like to get away with things and sometimes we do so with like-minded people.""   And the greatest benefit of all to politicians? When you swear you don't sound like one. You sound like the rest of us. Trump, the billionaire who lives in a golden mansion and is actually nothing like the rest of us, is the poster child for this strategy.  He rolls out the crass and offensive language and the crowd goes wild. Remember this?  And remember the shock of hearing him gloat on tape about moving on a woman ""like a bitch"" and how he loves to ""grab 'em by the pussy.""   When it happened, I argued that the comments would not hurt him, and in a sick way those comments (and his apology later) would actually help him.  Consider the opening lines of his apology: ""I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not.""  He was making it clear -- I'm not a stiff Washington insider -- I swear, I make mistakes and I tell it like it is ... just like you. Clearly, it worked. According to a new poll, only 2% of the people who voted for Trump regret it.   Now that we've stepped into the Swear Zone, there's no turning back. Indeed, when Gillibrand dropped the f-bomb, people actually floated the theory that she's swearing because she's gearing up for a presidential run.  There's good reason to worry that these new, profane politics will distract us even further in an already confused and partisan time -- that we'll all be too romanced by the drama, emotion and swearing that we'll forget about what's really important for all our futures:  thoughtful discussion on policy and the issues. There's a time and place for bad words, and the place isn't every time a politician steps up to a mic. I can just imagine a politician explaining it to you this way: ""This political correctness s--t has to stop! When I swear, you think I'm being honest because of the limbic system in your f-ing brain and it makes me more goddamn convincing to you! I don't sound like a dumbass politician talking all kinds of fancy bulls--t. I sound like that buddy you drink beers with. How f-ing cool is that?""  It's not. Not fucking cool at all."
Stand up for centrist candidates,"There's more to Election Day than just the presidential campaign. The polarization of the parties has led directly to the divided and dysfunctional Congress we've seen over the past two years, leading to the lowest congressional approval ratings in recent history.   No matter who wins the presidency, we need to see more principled problem-solving centrists elected from both parties. That's why I'm continuing my pre-election CNN.com column tradition of listing some of the most standout centrist Senate and House candidates on the ballot this year. Centrism is one of most misunderstood and maligned political identities in our polarized hyper-partisan environment. Its advocates have been hunted into near-extinction on Capitol Hill by party-first conformists, angry ideologues and special interests. Politics: Key races to watch -- Senate, House and Governor But a look over this list shows a deeper philosophic consistency beyond party labels -- a commitment to generational responsibility and individual liberty that can be fairly described as fiscally conservative but socially liberal. Most of all, there is a common commitment to working together across party lines to solve problems rather than holding out for ideologically pure solutions. For a more detailed defense of the legitimacy of this political perspective, David Brooks gave a typically eloquent explanation of the centrist political leader as a craftsman in a must-read column.  The 10 standout centrist candidates on this list are independents, Republicans and Democrats who all recognize that hyper-partisanship is hurting our country because it is stopping us from solving the serious problems we face.   That's why we need them in the next Congress -- to break the fever of division and dysfunction, define the common ground that exists on the urgent issues we face and then build on them. Their success in the 2012 election would be a healthy step forward for the nation. 2012 ballot initiatives: Voter-run or special interest-hijacked? Angus King This independent's Senate campaign in Maine is the biggest nonpresidential race in the nation for many independent voters -- a gutsy challenge to the two parties that looks like it will prove successful. King has described himself as ""too fiscally conservative for the Democrats and too socially liberal for the Republicans -- like 75% of the American people.""  He proved his effectiveness in two terms as a popular independent governor of Maine in the 1990s. Now he is the odds-on favorite to succeed retiring centrist Republican Olympia Snowe in the Senate. If the Senate is closely divided, he could be the deciding vote. 
King has told me about his vision to bring together a coalition of senators in the vital center to break gridlock.  ""What if two or three other people like me around the country were elected who said: 'I don't care about the parties -- I just want to solve the problems ... We're going start talking to each other in a grown-up and civil way."" Here's hoping. Bob Kerrey The Medal of Honor winner, Nebraska governor, senator, presidential candidate and college president would return to Washington as an elder statesman committed to building bipartisan coalitions. He is one of the most respected and best liked political leaders of recent decades.  His opponent, social conservative state senator Deb Fischer, rode to victory in the Republican primary thanks to endorsements by the likes of Sarah Palin and Jim DeMint.  ""Somebody has to go back there and change Congress. Somebody has to stand the middle ground,"" Kerrey says. ""I want to be the person that makes that change happen."" This election is close in a center-right state, and former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel's endorsement of Democrat Kerrey on Thursday provided another boost.  Having Kerrey back in the senate would be a win not just for the people of Nebraska, but for the entire country.  Heather Wilson A former congresswoman, Air Force officer and Rhodes Scholar, the New Mexico Republican   would be an excellent addition to the U.S. Senate and the Republican conference. She won more than 40% of the Hispanic vote in each of her six congressional races. But with the polarization of the Hispanic population over neighboring Arizona's immigration laws, New Mexico has moved from bellwether swing state to the Democratic column. So, Wilson is flying against stiff headwinds. But she's a big-tent, pro-life Republican -- fiscally conservative, centrist on social issues and strong on defense -- with a demonstrated ability to win over independent voters. Her biggest problem is the rightward drift of the GOP and the consequent alienation of the Hispanic vote in a presidential year.  But she would make a great senator that New Mexico would be proud of for decades to come. Joe Donnelly The Indiana Democrat is running to replace centrist Republican statesman Dick Lugar in the Senate against the tea party-backed Republican nominee Richard Mourdock. A three-term Congressman with a decidedly centrist record, Donnelly has been arguing that Mourdock is too extreme for Indiana -- with plenty of help from Mourdock himself. From Mourdock's saying that bipartisanship ""ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view,"" to slamming centrists in the Senate by arguing that ""the time for collegiality is past ... it's time for confrontation,"" to his now infamous comments that pregnancies that result from rape are ""God's will,"" Mourdock has managed to find himself losing a Senate race in a state that Mitt Romney is winning easily. Hoosiers don't seem to want an embarrassing advocate of extremism in the Senate. They'd do better with Donnelly. Linda Lingle It takes an impressive person to win Hawaii's governorship as a Republican, but former Maui Mayor Linda Lingle managed to distinguish herself as a successful and popular leader during her two terms, while breaking down barriers as the first woman and first Jewish governor of the Aloha State. Running in a presidential election cycle with Hawaii-born Barack Obama on the ballot is no picnic for a Republican, but Lingle has overcome long odds before -- she won reelection as governor by the largest margin in Hawaii's history. She's developed an impressive record as a decisive leader, combining fiscal responsibility with a big-tent approach on social issues. She would be a refreshing centrist Republican voice in the U.S. Senate. Tim Kaine It's a tight Senate race between two former Virginia governors -- centrist Democrat Tim Kaine and conservative Republican George Allen -- to see who will succeed Jim Webb in the Senate. Kaine is the kind of solid Third Way Democrat who has proven he can win statewide in the Old Dominion state, like his predecessor Mark Warner, who currently serves in the Senate and has been a leader of the Gang of Six negotiations to find a bipartisan deal on the deficit and the debt.  Kaine -- a former DNC Chair - is not as nonpartisan as many centrists, but he is a classic DLC Blue Dog of the kind we have seen almost hunted into extinction on Capital Hill. His election would send a welcome signal about that tradition's persistence and further commitment to the kind of thoughtful bipartisan cooperation we need to see in the Senate. Scott Brown When Scott Brown won the special election to succeed Ted Kennedy in the Senate, it was seen as a tea party victory predicated upon his opposition to Obama's health care reform. But as senator, Brown has developed a decidedly centrist voting record -- being recognized by the National Journal voting records as having a 55% conservative and 45% liberal composite record, placing him squarely in the center of the Senate.  He has tried to rekindle the Ed Brooke Massachusetts moderate tradition and is locked in a tough race against Elizabeth Warren, who has developed a strong following for her fearless work in the wake of the fiscal crisis. But Brown's record cannot and should not be ignored -- and if he loses this Senate seat in the headwinds of the likely Obama landslide in his home state of Massachusetts, we could see Brown back in the Senate or serve as governor sometime in the future. Jim Graves To many moderates, Michele Bachmann is the symbol of everything that's wrong with our divided and dysfunctional congress. She's quick to call opponents anti-American and weave unhinged conspiracy theories into policy debates. But she's never had a serious candidate campaign against her until now.  Jim Graves is a 58-year-old, self-made Minnesota businessman and grandfather of seven, still married to his high-school sweetheart. And he's got Bachmann on defense in her reelection effort. ""My policy approach transcends political lines,"" Graves told me in an interview for DailyBeast, ""I'm a centrist, a libertarian when it comes to social issues. I don't think government should be involved with personal lives. I really believe in separation of church and state. Bachmann wants to blur those lines -- she would (replace) our democracy with a theocracy,"" he says. ""She epitomizes everything that's wrong with Congress and this country -- a lack of civility, a lack of bipartisan or nonpartisan approach to problem solving."" Richard Tisei A Republican running for Congress in Massachusetts this year might be dismissed as a political suicide mission, but Richard Tisei is an exception in every sense. He's running a strong race against an uninspiring and ineffective liberal incumbent John Tierney in a state where registered independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans. Tisei is popular state legislator and a self-described ""live and let live' Republican -- who applies the principles of individual liberty and individual responsibility consistently in his political philosophy -- get government out of the bedroom and out of the boardroom. He is also, perhaps not incidentally, openly gay. But Tisei's constituents have come to see him as a strong advocate of fiscal responsibility and limited government, a libertarian New England Republican in the mold of Bill Weld rather than Mitt Romney. Richard Hanna This upstate New York Republican congressman is an independent thinker who does not let party loyalty get in the way of his common sense approach to solving problems. The longtime businessman and community leader does not mince words or shy away from condemning impractical extremes on both sides. He told the Syracuse Post-Standard, ""I'm frustrated by how much we -- I mean the Republican Party -- are willing to give deferential treatment to our extremes in this moment in history. ... If all people do is go down there and join a team, and the team is invested in winning and you have something that looks very similar to the shirts and the skins, there's not a lot of value there.""  That's the kind of principled independence, and commitment to governing in the national interest, that we need to see more of in the n"
