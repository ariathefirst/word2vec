"Manipulation, Payoffs and Lies -- The Democrats' Endgame On Health Care","Democrats have convinced themselves that it would be far worse to do nothing on health care than listen to the concerns of the public. And they have demonstrated they will stop at nothing to get some form of legislation passed – even using the House Rules Committee to draft a new rule that would make it possible for Speaker Pelosi to pass the bill without an actual vote!

This jaw-dropping abuse of power has appropriately been labeled the “Slaughter Strategy” after Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY) the tactic’s chief architect and a close Pelosi ally. It would give members of the Democratic Caucus cover. Why, you ask? Because it would skip the step that would force our lawmakers to place an “aye” vote next to a radioactive, unpopular piece of legislation that they will have to defend until Election Day in the fall.

This type of manipulation of government process might be the most perverse we’ve seen to date.

Why are they doing this, you might ask? Pelosi needs to employ any game plan she can to get her way since she’s poised to lose about a dozen members over the issue of federal funding of abortion. Though Bart Stupak, and others, will hold firm, there are members of Congress who will cave in to the Speaker’s wishes from pressure. Think of it this way: the vote on health care reform will be the defining moment that showcases who the true pro-life Democrats really are.

The White House will also help Speaker Pelosi any way it can to drag the bloody body that is the health care bill over the finish line. The Associated Press reported on Friday that though Obama has railed against the ""ugly process"" of cutting special deals, the president and his top advisers were prime time players in negotiations on the agreements to win votes and move the legislation forward.

So what exactly will they promise the members to get their way?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Answer: A lot. And a lot of those promises will include various ways to spend your money.                 
                

            
                As of now, the votes for passage aren’t there. No less an expert than the House Democratic Whip revealed that the party is short of the votes on Sunday’s “Meet the Press.” This is despite Pelosi’s intentional deception to portray the picture as otherwise last Wednesday when she insisted she would have the 216 needed for victory if the bill was brought to the floor. But that was a lie; if she had the support necessary we would be watching a vote on C-SPAN. You’ve gotta believe that the second she hits the magic number, a vote will immediately be called.

This week will reveal the harsh reality of corruption in the Democratic leadership. All of the Democrat’s lip service on “change you can believe in” (Obama) and “cleaning up the swamp” (Pelosi) will be exposed as hollow and untrue. No matter the cost – financial or political – the left is prepared to do whatever it takes to score a win. But that’s the thing about cost, eventually you have to pay. And pay they will.                 
                

            
                Sadly, so will we.

"A doctor, not a bureaucrat, should be in charge of Health and Human Services","Now Playing                            Obama pays tribute to Sebelius, announces replacement                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                ""The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans,"" Jack Kennedy famously said in his 1961 inaugural address, a phrase once swollen with optimism and American pride.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It may be tempting for President Obama to use this same expression now to describe Health and Human Services Secretary (Baby Boomer) Sebelius handing off the HHS secretarial torch to her apparent (Generation X) replacement, Sylvia Burwell, but such a sentiment would be false optimism.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                It is time for a physician or an expert in health care to administer Health and Human Services, not another numbers-massaging manager, no matter how able.                 
                

            
                It is easy to forget that Secretary Sebelius was once Kansas Insurance Commissioner. This qualified her to administer health insurance, not health care.                 
                

            
                Though she certainly helped to fumble the ObamaCare website rollout, an even greater misdeed was her inability to anticipate how the arrival of ObamaCare could translate into less care and less access and higher premiums for those who already have insurance.                
                

            
                HHS stands for ""Health and Human Services,"" not Health and Insurance Services. Only a doctor who deals with ObamaCare every day can attest to the problems the growing insurance bureaucracy pose to actual patient care.                 
                

            
                Here are some actual questions that come up in my office:                  
                

            
                1. Is that patient eligible to see Dr. Siegel or is his insurance expired?                 
                

            
                2. How come Dr. Siegel is listed as a Blue Cross provider but is not part of the Blue Cross network for policies offered on the state exchange?                 
                

            
                3. Can Dr. Siegel's patient Victoria Scott afford the care she needs for her thyroid condition when she has a whooping deductible (almost $6000) on her Bronze plan?                
                

            
                It hardly matters to doctors and their patients what the cumulative numbers are for new enrollees on the state exchanges, and how many of these folks were actually uninsured beforehand (the latest RAND data suggests less than half). What matters most is what kind of care these patients can get and at what cost, and whether we doctors can still afford to take care of them.                
                

            
                Sylvia Burwell said at a recent Atlantic magazine event that the Affordable Care Act “is about improving access…about improving the quality of health care.”                 
                

            
                Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the new law does either one.                
                

            
                Contrast Burwell’s abstract statement to the practical wisdom of Senator John Barrasso, M.D., a practicing orthopedist for many years and former Wyoming Physician of the Year.                 
                

            
                He wrote in Investor’s Business Daily about how ObamaCare interferes with the real world doctor/patient relationship: “I continue to hear from my patients in Wyoming. They have always had my home phone number. They are anxious and angry. They know what they wanted from health care reform: access to quality, affordable care…That's not what they got with this law. Now, many face losing the doctor who has always been there for them.”                
                

            
                Dr. Barrasso would make a terrific HHS secretary, unfortunately, President Obama would likely never consider such a move.                 
                

            
                Sylvia Burwell may be a capable budget director, and her track record with the Clinton administration, the Gates and Walmart Foundations certainly shows that she is an able politician, but where is the evidence that she can manage a health care system that is becoming more complex by the day?                
                

            
                In the era of personalized health care, where genetic advances in cancer research and risk assessment predict both diseases and their expensive treatments on a patient by patient basis, the one-size-fits-all insurance model is becoming increasingly out of date. The more complex our health care solutions, the more unaffordable or inadequate ObamaCare will be.                
                

            
                Sylvia Burwell may do a better job presenting the latest insurance numbers to the public, but she will be no more qualified in deciding whether an 11-year-old like Sarah Murnaghan should get a life-saving lung transplant with adult lungs than Kathleen Sebelius was.                
                

            
                HHS needs a physician or at least a bio-engineer to navigate through the treacherous ObamaCare waters, not another insurance expert to sell us yet another policy to cover our mammograms and our colonoscopies even as our collective ship sinks

House Democrats Put Nail in Health Care's Coffin,"Yesterday morning the first thing I heard was that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Steny Hoyer had written in USA Today that the protesters of health care reform don't want the facts and that the protests are un-American.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I had one thought:                
                

            
                Oh no they didn't!                
                

            
                I figured that maybe the headline writer had gotten ahead of himself, ""over-wrote"" the story, as we in media relations complain about sometimes. But no -- it was a direct quote. And, with that one adjective, the House Democrats probably have sealed the bill's fate: failure.                
                

            
                The Democrats have been so tone-deaf on this issue that they just can't believe their eyes and ears -- they can't believe that people actually don't want the reform they're pushing.                
                

            
                Beyond seeming to have lost touch with the heart and soul of America, they almost seem offended that anyone would question their proposal, express indignation when asked how much it would cost, and nearly burst with frustration because don't you realize we've been fighting this battle for decades and we already answered these questions and that the moment is here and we can't just let it pass us by?!                
                

            
                Last month when the Democrats first started pushing back at the protesters, they insulted their intelligence and their individualism. Since that wasn't working, they took it one step further and insulted their patriotism. Advice to Democrats: stop digging.                
                

            
                The leaders in the Democratic party have a responsibility to lay out clear proposals and to explain them fully. If they can't do that, that's not the fault of Americans who are worried about the consequences of just putting their trust in Washington, D.C.                
                

            
                And so, where to they go from here? Unless they are willing to apologize for the insult and offer to listen for once, they'll be rubbing salt in the their self-inflicted wound.                
                

            
                Does their health care plan cover that?

Obama Plays By Chicago Rules In Health Care Fight,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Obama has called for honest, bipartisan negotiations to produce legislation that will show America the way out of its current health care crisis. But as far as Thursday’s White House summit on health care is concerned, he’s still operating by Chicago rules. He wants Republicans to meekly submit to his team’s plan rather than honestly inviting them to join him in building a bipartisan plan from the ground up.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Led by House Minority Leader John Boehner, the GOP has made one request of the president in the weeks leading up to the summit: that everyone concerned start over again from the beginning, that they agree to drop the legislation pending in Congress in lieu of making a fresh start in which all sides will have input. On Monday President Obama revealed how unwilling he is to move toward the GOP, by introducing yet another massive proposal that not only reinforces many of the elements of governmental intrusion into the health care economy that the Republicans have already rejected but, in the words of several commentators, “doubles down” on what the Democrats in Congress have already thrown up for consideration. Perhaps that was the lesson he drew out of his recent trip to Las Vegas, but it’s not a good strategy for Washington. It is not negotiation in “good faith” so much as it is as an effort to force the Republicans to deal.
It’s a desperate gambit, and one that is not likely to work.                
                

            
                As Megan McArdle wrote yesterday in The Atlantic, in order for the new Obama bill to have a chance, Pelosi has “to persuade someone (probably a Blue Dog) to vote for it, who already voted against it. Progressives have been making the almost-plausible argument that the public is going to treat a vote for the House or Senate bill as a vote for final passage, so Democrats might as well go ahead and pass the thing. But their best argument totally falls apart for those who originally voted “no.” But Pelosi, as McArdle acknowledges, is three votes down from where she was when the House passed the health care bill the last time – by a margin of three votes. There is now no margin left, and that’s before taking the abortion issue into account. The new Obama bill not only doesn’t contain any of the House or Senate provisions to prevent tax dollars from funding abortion, but it actually includes a monthly “abortion premium” fee. This affects the political calculations related to the bill’s potential passage.                
                

            
                A number of Democrats, following the lead of Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak, have said they are unwilling to vote for any health care bill that lacks tough anti-abortion language. As McArdle puts it, “If you lose many of the Stupak folks, then the bill's done; there is not a snowball's chance in hell that you are going to persuade any significant number of the prior ‘no’ votes in the Democratic caucus to throw their careers on the pyre of Democratic health care ambitions.”                
                

            
                Knowing that, the Republicans should not grovel before the insistent majority, but should instead put up a strong defense of their own position. This should include paid media campaigns for the benefit of the folks back home to let the voters know the GOP actually has a number of ideas that will successfully address the problems that currently exist in the health care system without destroying it, as Obama’s new proposal would do.                
                

            
                Independently, several pro-life organizations like Let Freedom Ring are planning to do likewise. We will measure public support for the single-purpose health care reform proposals put forward by various GOP members of the House and Senate, especially those originating in the Republican Study Committee under the leadership of Dr. Tom Price. Yes, Dr. Price, Dr. Gingrey, Dr. Broun, Dr. Boustany and Dr. Coburn are among 12 physicians who are Republican members of the House and the Senate. -- compare that number to the 5 physicians who are Democratic members of Congress -- itself an intriguing contrast.                
                

            
                Even though the structure of the so-called summit is designed to produce anything but an honest negotiation, Republicans can still win by refusing to submit to demands to sign onto the latest iteration of the Obama-Reid-Pelosi health care takeover. Some Republicans may refuse to participate at all as a matter of principle. Others may walk out when it becomes clear to any observer that the exercise is rigged. Those remaining should stand strong and refuse to submit to the iron fist of Rahm Emanuel that lies within the velvet glove of President Obama.

It's No Accident -- Why Goldman's Suddenly Getting Grilled,"While they still have total control of Washington, the Obama administration and congressional Democrats have been working feverishly to pass a financial regulatory reform bill that would give the federal government expanded powers over Wall Street. At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched an investigation into Goldman Sachs and one of its vice presidents for defrauding investors by misstating and omitting key facts about a financial product tied to subprime mortgages just as the U.S. housing market was beginning to falter. Most recently, in an outrageous abuse of power, Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich.) released internal e-mails from Goldman employees, the same week Goldman execs are slated to testify on Capitol Hill, and on the same week that Democrats make their final push to pass the financial reform bill.
If you think there are coincidences in Washington when it comes to timing, think again.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Presidents are always in need of enemies. Bill Clinton had “the vast right wing conspiracy.” Obama has the Tea Party movement, and Wall Street – and he is using Wall Street, namely Goldman, as a paper tiger to help build support for financial reform. It should be noted that though both Republicans and Democrats have taken money from the firm, Obama is the highest recipient of Goldman donations by almost $1 million. By taking their money with one hand, and spanking them with the other, Obama is sending a message to other Wall Street firms that they better line up behind his reform or else they’ll be next to get an SEC shakedown from a politically-tainted prosecution.                
                

            
                Government has always had these massive powers, but it’s never used them in such a grossly abusive manor to impugn the private sector to arguably get legislation passed so quickly. The fact that Senator Levin released private emails should have us all worried. What’s to stop Congress from releasing any private e-mails to the public from any company it seeks to punish? Were the e-mails showing shameful behavior? Yes. Goldman staffers were boasting about making record profits off of the mortgage crisis. But there is no evidence that the actions mentioned in the e-mails were illegal. And it seems highly unlikely that government can legally tear down an entire company based on a couple low level employees. However, the more control Washington has over private business, the more we can expect to see Congress butt into their business, illegal or not, and it won’t stop with the financial sector.                
                

            
                This is an issue of power over privacy. And it doesn’t help Obama and Democrats, no matter the motive. This investigation only fuels the public distrust of Washington and bolsters the anti-incumbent sentiment embodied by the tea party movement and many independents. Think about the rage against how the process went down when it came to health care reform. Now we’re seeing the public question the process yet again with regard to the timing and motivation of the investigation and the leaked e-mails, as well as the speed in which the legislation is being shepherded through the Hill when it comes to financial regulatory reform.                
                

            
                Nobody wants the street to run wild, but we must make sure that in an effort to regulate Wall Street, we don’t end up destroying it. Sure, Wall Street has been ethically challenged, but the real root of bad behavior began in Washington. It’s time we get access to their e-mails.

8 Truths -- and the Consequences -- In Obama's First Year,"It has been almost a year since President Obama was sworn in as our nation’s fourty-fourth president.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The hype over the “Obama brand” and the promise for “change” was deafening from Obama supporters and much of the media leading up to and after the inauguration.                
                

            
                Now, after a year in office it is fair to take a look back at the president’s record and match truth to consequence.                
                

            
                Here is a list of key issues for the Obama administration:                
                

            
                The Closing of Gitmo                
                

            
                Truth: One of Obama’s first acts as president was to sign an Executive Order on January 22, 2009 ordering the closing of the Guantanamo Bay Naval Prison as a U.S. detention
facility. In his remarks on that day, the president promised that Guantanamo would be closed within his first year in office.                
                

            
                Consequence: Guantanamo is still open and the administration has found it difficult to come up with a viable alternative to the facility or what to do with the detainees they now seek to detain or release.                
                

            
                The Economy                
                

            
                Truth: The president’s first major piece of legislation was the now infamous $787 billion dollar “Stimulus” bill passed by the Senate in February 2009. This was the bill that admittedly most legislators did not read before voting on it – the one with no transparency. Passage of the bill was demanded by the president, who said that time was of the essence to save jobs. The president promised that the bill would prevent the nation’s unemployment rate from rising above eight percent.                
                

            
                Consequence: Most of the stimulus money remains unspent. Unemployment has topped 10% nationally since the stimulus bill was passed and in many urban areas tops 16% and is rising.                
                

            
                Foreign Policy:                
                

            
                Truth: The president promised that with his unique persona and his “new style” of governing that he could unilaterally convince all those who don’t like us, to like us. He convinced his believers that all he needed to do is “change the tone” and dictators in countries like Iran and North Korea would abandon their nuclear weapons programs and that terrorists would stand down. The president promised a new era of global cooperation on “global warming” and predicted he could bring historic global agreement.                
                

            
                Consequence: The world is a much more dangerous place since Obama took office. Iran has escalated their nuclear weapons program and North Korea has not abandoned theirs. No headway has been made in the Middle East peace process. Talks broke down on “global warming” in Copenhagen in December and no concrete agreement was delivered as promised by the president. As a consequence no progress was made domestically on passage of cap-and-trade legislation.                
                

            
                War on Terror:                
                

            
                Truth: Immediately after taking office and in the months following the inauguration the Obama administration actively made a point of removing the words “terrorism” and the “War on Terror” from their public speech. Instead they choose to call acts of terrorism – “man-caused disasters.” The president went on what I can only describe as an “apology tour” which he kicked with the first sit-down interview of his presidency on Al Arabia television in which he pandered and apologized for past American aggressiveness.                
                

            
                Consequence: The foiled Christmas Day terrorist attack on a Northwest Airlines flight over Michigan forced the president, albeit several days later, to acknowledge the obvious -- there is indeed a “War on Terror.” And it does not matter who our president is -- radical Islamists seek to destroy America, today, tomorrow, next year or even a decade from now.                
                

            
                Transparency:                
                

            
                Truth: President Obama promised that a hallmark of his administration would be transparency. This is some of what he promised:
“We’ll have [healthcare reform] negotiations televised on C-SPAN, so the people can see who is making arguments on behalf of their constituents and who is making arguments on behalf of the drug companies or the insurance companies.”                
                

            
                Consequence: To date there have been NO televised negotiations on health care, the “stimulus bill,” cap-and-trade or any other major piece of legislation being advanced by the Obama administration and the Democratically-controlled Congress.                
                

            
                Immigration:                
                

            
                Truth: President Obama promised to make immigration reform a top priority in his first year.
Consequence: President Obama has done nothing on immigration reform in his first year, other than traveling in August to Mexico where he announced he will take no action on comprehensive immigration reform until 2010.                
                

            
                Health Care:                
                

            
                Truth: President Obama demanded health care be passed before the August 2009 Congressional recess and said that he would not sign a health care reform bill without a “public option.”                
                

            
                Consequence: Health care legislation was NOT passed in August and it still has not been passed. It is clear that the public does not want a “public option” and now the president has abandoned that requirement. Democrats -- NOT Republicans -- have been the one and only reason that a health care bill has not passed and thus not signed by their party’s president.                
                

            
                Our National Debt:                
                

            
                Truth: During the 2008 campaign then-candidate Obama was highly critical of the national debt. He vowed to “take a scalpel” to the national budget and to make it a top priority to reduce the nation’s debt.                
                

            
                Consequence: The president has already quadrupled the nation’s deficit thanks to his failed “stimulus bill.” This year the deficit has increased by almost $1.8 trillion dollars and is likely to increase by a trillion dollars a year for the next ten years.                
                

            
                A year ago many believed that Barack Obama was the only politician able to solve the problem facing America. They believed he had all the answers and were mesmerized by his powerful oratory and presence. They believed that all he had to do was address an issue and it would be settled. Supporters saw him as a leader with extraordinary powers and they spoke of him in awe and hushed tones.                
                

            
                The reality is that the president is not all that. He is a person who is not into “heavy lifting.” For my money, he never was. It’s my belief that he ran for a state senate post in Illinois so that he could run for a seat in the U.S. Senate. He ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate and then within 2 years of being elected to that post ran for president! He hasn’t spent much time governing although, no one can argue, he is one hell of a campaigner.                
                

            
                The problem now is that Obama -- the candidate -- has reached the end of the political line. He, and the advisers who surround him, never grasped the fact that the campaign was over, that the time to govern has arrived. Instead of taking the reigns of power, he ceded his power and authority to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. What we got out of this deal was a disastrous “stimulus bill” that was rammed through the Congress and a manufactured “crisis” on health care that has paralyzed our government for the past 10 months.                
                

            
                In short, the reality is that our president is just a mere mortal. He has been seriously overrated in terms of both his competence and ability.                
                

            
                He has not delivered on the “change” he promised -- not because he doesn’t want to, but because he doesn’t know how too.                
                

            
                Reluctantly, many Americans have finally gotten wise to the fact that politically, their president, just like the emperor in the the fairy tale, has no clothes.

	Former deputy assistant to President George W. Bush"
Obama's Most Important Appointment,"This past week a number of United States Government Web sites were hit by a ""Distributed Denial of Service"" attack. The attack effectively silenced these agencies presence on the World Wide Web. While this is mostly an inconvenience -- since the ability to access a Web site rarely impacts our day-to-day lives, it shows that our systems are vulnerable, and may just represent the tip of the iceberg in the murky world of cyber-attacks.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The attacks in the U.S. seemed to coincide with cyber-attacks against South Korean government sites with North Korea test firing a number of new short to mid-range missiles. As of July 9, the federal government has not publicly attributed these attacks to a country or organized group of hackers. However, it has been reported that the Russian military utilized cyber-attacks in their recent foray into Georgia, and last year the country of Estonia was effectively shut down under the weight of similar attacks. With this in mind, it's easy to see that cyber-space is a new battleground, and understand why it is important that the United States Government take action to address the inherent vulnerabilities that exist in our country's critical infrastructure.                
                

            
                On May 29, President Obama announced the creation of a cyber czar. More importantly, President Obama was wise enough to understand that cybersecurity is not just a national security issue it's also an economic issue. For this reason the new cyber czar will report to both the heads of the NSC and NEC. What may not be understood about the importance of the cyber czar is the fact that the position will serve as the linchpin for many of the administration's major initiatives -- especially in the area of health care reform and global climate change. While health care reform and global climate change are sexy topics, and deserve our government's attention, they are not nearly as important as cybersecurity. This may sound odd, since it probably isn't even on the mind of the average American but consider this -- most of the proposed solutions to both of these issues require the use of information technology to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. Digital medical records have been recommended as a panacea for saving money and reducing the cost of health care, but they must remain confidential and be easy to access to be effective. If our cyberspace is not secure, our records will have none of these and doctors and patients will be slow to adopt these new cost saving technologies.                 
                

            
                The so-called ""smart grid"" has been touted as key to cutting green house gasses by helping to reduce the need for more electricity production. Since electric production is highly dependent on fossil fuels that increase carbon emissions, a reduced demand for electricity directly relates to reduced carbon emissions. An updated grid is critical to incorporating solar and wind energy and other low carbon footprint technologies,  into the electrical grid. This, too, requires the use of information systems that have integrity and are available 24-hours a day. Without cybersecurity, these systems will simply not be feasible and could lead to massive power outages in our country. In effect, securing our nation's critical information technology infrastructure is vital to solving some of the most hotly debated political issues of our time.                 
                

            
                The situation we find ourselves in is analogous to farmers producing a bumper crop but having it rot in the fiedls because they forgot to build the road and buy the trucks to get the food to market. Let's learn from this past weekend's attacks -- we cannot produce wonderful technologies designed to solve real problems without paying attention to the critical infrastructure that enables these new technologies to work. Let's remember that a secure infrastructure, as boring as that may sound, is critical to the future of some of our government's most ambitious projects and the safety of our nation.

                In recent weeks, the national media have been obsessed with highlighting divisions and disagreements among Republicans on Capitol Hill. It’s time for GOP lawmakers to remind the American people of what unites us.
 
 Republicans are united in our desire to dismantle President Obama’s health care law and replace it with patient-centered alternatives that reduce costs, expand quality insurance coverage, and improve access to care.                                             ADVERTISEMENT

                We’re united in our desire to simplify the U.S. tax code and encourage job creation by lowering marginal rates and broadening the base.                 
                

            
                We’re united in our desire to abolish misguided regulations.

                To appoint constitutionalist judges who will faithfully uphold our founding document.
 
 In other words, what unites Republicans is far more significant than what divides Republicans.                
                

            
                The disagreements of the past month have mostly been about tactics rather than policy. But those disagreements are now behind us.                 
                

            
                Moving forward, if Republicans want to maximize our leverage and achieve conservative policy gains, we must remain united and focus on issues where President Obama and the Democrats are clearly vulnerable.
 
 For example: The administration spent more than $400 million to get the ObamaCare health exchanges up and running by October 1, but so far they’ve been a total disaster.                 
                

            
                Across the country, people have found it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to sign up. Indeed, only a tiny fraction of all visitors to the official Obamacare website have successfully enrolled.                 
                

            
                Polls have consistently shown that most Americans want to delay ObamaCare’s personal health insurance mandate.
 
 Republicans agree that, at the very least, Washington should delay the mandate for individuals and families, especially since President Obama has unilaterally delayed the corresponding mandate for employers.                 
                

            
                We also agree that health-care reform should not (1) impose a trillion-dollar tax hike, (2) discourage full-time hiring, (3) drive up insurance premiums, (4) cause large numbers of Americans to lose their existing coverage, (5) weaken Medicare and Medicaid, or (6) hamper medical innovation.                 
                

            
                ObamaCare does all of these things.                 
                

            
                In the months ahead, Republicans should continue making the case for alternative reforms that would expand quality insurance coverage while simultaneously lowering costs and improving patient access.
 
 In addition, we should continue pressing the Obama administration to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. Amid the worst unemployment crisis since the 1930s -- at a time when millions of Americans have been jobless for more than six months and our labor-force participation rate has fallen to a 35-year low -- there is no good reason to oppose an energy project that would create thousands of well-paying middle-class jobs and reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern, Russian, and Venezuelan oil.
 
 Speaking of job creation, Republicans should keep up the drumbeat for pro-growth, revenue-neutral tax reform. Americans now spend roughly 6.1 billion hours each year complying with IRS filing requirements. That represents a massive waste of time, money, and energy for businesses and individuals alike.                 
                

            
                Republicans overwhelmingly support a simpler, more logical tax system with lower marginal rates and fewer loopholes. That’s a winning message, and it’s one we should aggressively promote.
 
 Finally, Republicans should remain united in blocking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is America’s second-most-influential judicial body.                 
                

            
                Senator Reid has made no secret of his intent: Over the summer, he told Nevada Public Radio that Democrats were hoping to “switch the majority” on the D.C. Circuit to make it a rubberstamp for big-government liberalism. Republicans have objected to this power grab, and we should continue to do so.                 
                

            
                Based on its caseload, the D.C. Circuit simply does not need more judges at the present time.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, there are plenty of appellate courts that are overburdened and do need more judges. Our priority should be to fill those vacancies, not to let Harry Reid stack a single court.
 
 Republicans will always have internal debates, but -- more importantly -- we share a determination to reverse the destructive policies of the past five years.                 
                

            
                The results of Obamanomics speak for themselves: Since June of 2009, we have experienced the weakest economic recovery and the longest stretch of high unemployment in postwar history.                
                

            
                The president claims to be deeply troubled by income inequality. And yet, as the New York Times reported in late August, the trend of rising income inequality “appears to have accelerated during the Obama administration” (my emphasis).                 
                

            
                Indeed, according to one measure of the income gap, inequality has increased about four times faster under President Obama than it did under President Bush.
 
 Republicans want to restore the economic and constitutional principles that made our country the envy of the world.                 
                

            
                Conservative health-care policies would help all Americans obtain quality insurance coverage and quality care.                 
                

            
                Conservative tax policies would make it easier to raise families, start businesses, and save for retirement.                 
                

            
                Conservative energy policies would create thousands of jobs and bolster national security.                 
                

            
                Conservative regulatory policies would end “too big to fail.”                
                

            
                With President Obama sitting in the White House and Democrats controlling the Senate, these policies face an uphill battle. No question about it.                 
                

            
                Yet by remaining united behind common values and common interests, Republicans have a chance to win substantial short-term victories -- and set the stage for much bigger victories in the future.

An Old Whine In New Bottles,"President Obama gave his 28th speech on health care reform to a joint session of Congress this past week. Too bad the presidency doesn't consist solely of such ""big occasion"" speeches. The president excels in this area. Unfortunately, the basic principles he enunciated in this 28th rendition suffered from the same defects as the first 27 and explains why the public is resisting this latest version.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                There are no cost containment measures in the health care bill. If the president's latest plan is enacted, costs will go UP, not down. By adding millions of new consumers of health care to a static pool of health care providers, the simple law of supply and demand can provide no other outcome than to increase the cost. Costs will either rise or available care must be rationed. In addition, further cuts to Medicare providers will shift costs even further onto private plans. Finally, lawsuits against medical providers remain unchecked, adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to health care costs.                
                

            
                Americans' health care choices will decrease, not increase. A government bureaucracy run by an unelected commissioner will determine which services and benefits must be included in every health care plan in America. This can only reduce competition among providers. If you do not have an ""approved"" plan, the Internal Revenue Service can fine you. What does the health care bureaucrat know about your health care that you do not? Do you want the IRS to have access to your medical records? Such federal regulation of insurance providers is the ""public option"" by another name.                
                

            
                State finances will become far worse. The states currently pay around 43% of all costs for Medicaid, the government program that helps poor Americans with their medical bills. Congressional plans call for huge increases in Medicaid eligibility (up to 133% of the poverty line) and spending. States will be faced with the mother of unfunded mandates and almost certainly have to raise taxes on individuals with income of less than $200,000, a violation of President Obama's ""prime directive"" on taxation.

Job creation and economic growth will suffer. The plan will substantially increase federal spending on health care. Part of the spending will be financed by tax increases, the rest by adding to the federal deficit, which is already scheduled to DOUBLE in the next seven years. This can only inhibit job creation at a time when unemployment is heading toward double digits. Why would the president endorse a plan that would delay economic recovery at a time that more and more Americans are looking for work?

The president was eloquent as usual on behalf of his ideas. The problem is that the American public has already spoken: we do not want what the president is proposing. It is hardly heroic for congressional liberals to demand radical changes to satisfy their ideological imperatives by risking the seats of moderate Democrats. We will soon see if the moderates will cooperate in their own destruction.

How Could An American President Be So Anti-American?,"After an initial grace period in which most Americans were willing to give a new president the benefit of the doubt, what this nation has steadily watched is a man and an administration almost exclusively governing against the will of the people.  While the crux of his predecessor’s low approval ratings were in fighting an ‘unpopular war’, President Obama is watching his own approval rating plunge due to an unpopular, well, everything else.  His record has been so blatantly in contrast to the will of this nation, that it could very nearly be defined as anti-American.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The latest example of this can be seen in the president’s decision to voice his support for the construction of the Ground Zero mosque.  While CNN called his message regarding the mosque ‘incoherent’, Americans understood his initial comments quite clearly – and they’re not taking kindly to hearing their president express support for a project that they overwhelmingly oppose.  Nearly 70 percent of Americans object to the mosque being built on hallowed ground.  (Yes, the site was actively involved on 9/11 when the landing gear assembly of one of the planes used in the attack crashed through the roof of what was then a Burlington Coat Factory).                
                

            
                Why is there such opposition?  Because the people aren’t buying into the administration’s talking points on this matter.  What they understand, and what the administration fails to understand, is that this building has nothing to do with religious freedom.  Muslims are not being prohibited from practicing their religion.  They are simply being asked to display a sense of decency by building the mosque in an area not directly involved in such an emotional event for our nation; away from the site where thousands of lives ended in a declaration of war from radical Islam.                
                

            
                America understands common sense and decency.  It appears our president does not.                
                

            
                The Ground Zero mosque certainly hasn’t been the only example of the Obama administration fighting hard to ignore the voice of the people.  It is almost as if White House briefings indicate the mood of the country, and the president subsequently instructs his staff to move in the opposite direction.                 
                

            
                Observe…                
                

            
                
 The most obvious example of this has been the force-feeding of the health care reform bill down the collective throats of a nation.  With the vote looming in mid-March, the measure was opposed by likely voters by a wide margin, 54-41 percent.  Worse, the respondents who felt the most strongly about the bill were overwhelmingly in opposition.  45 percent strongly opposed, compared to 26 percent who strongly favored the plan.
 The U.S. Justice Department’s decision to fight the Arizona immigration law through the courts; a law that 59 percent of U.S. voters would like to see in their very own state.  Similar findings demonstrate that prior to last month’s ruling, 56 percent opposed the decision to challenge the legality of the law in the first place.
 It is the first victory touted by the Obama administration, it is the topic of his current ‘summer of recovery’ tour, and it was (and remains) a big mistake according to most Americans.  Just two weeks prior to signing his $787 billion stimulus bill into law, two separate polls showed citizens beginning to question the wasteful government spending plan.  It was opposed 43-37 percent, but that didn’t stop the president and his cohorts from pursuing their economic agenda at the people’s expense.  Fortunately for the unemployed, as Obama promised, the unemployment ratestayed below 8 percent and, er … well, never mind.
 In response to the oil spill crisis in the Gulf of Mexico, Obama issued a ban on deepwater oil drilling, a policy that nearly three quarters of Americans opposed.  Because the opposition to this was so massive, the administration apparently viewed it as a policy more-so in need of passage, issuing two moratoriums on deepwater drilling -- a move that fellow Democrat Mary Landrieu claimed could “cost more jobs than the spill itself.""  Perhaps the ‘summer of recovery’ doesn’t apply to the gulf coast.
 Another result of the oil disaster has been the administration’s expressed desire to move forward on the so-called cap-and-trade legislation.  The legislation, an attempt to limit the total carbon dioxide emissions allowed to be released into the environment, while also imposing a massive tax burden on the economy, is opposed by 70 percent of Americans.
 Let’s not for a moment pretend that officials in the administration are not laying the groundwork for non-legislative blanket amnesty.  You need only ask President Bush how Americans feel about the prospect of amnesty.  On a side note, if there is any question as to their motives, heed the words of a former member of Obama’s National Latino Advisory Council, Eliseo Medina, who outlined what amnesty could do for the Democrats at the polls: 
                
                

            
                ""We reform the immigration laws; it puts 12 million people on the path to citizenship and eventually voters.  If we have eight million new voters who care about, and will be voting, we will be creating a governing coalition for the long term.""                
                

            
                Despite what the media would have you believe, it was clear that a majority of the people supported the President in his initial efforts post-election.  However, the descent into failure as an American leader has been steep and steady.  And it isn’t just recent actions that are contributing to the drop in approval ratings.  Lost in the more current list of unpopular moves are some of the early attempts at implementing policies which were equally unpopular.  They include…                
                

            
                
 An early term executive order that gave federal funding to family planning organizations that provide abortions, opposed by 58 percent of Americans.
 A subsequently embarrassing mark on the president’s record involving an executive order to close the prison in Guantanamo Bay.  The goal was to shut down the prison within one year, and was opposed by a 50-44 percent margin.  It remains open, but not due to a lack of effort on the President’s part.
 On that same note, the DOJ’s decision to investigate the treatment and possible torture of terrorists during the Bush administration was considered wrong by a 49-36 percent tally.
 The announcement that terrorists, including September 11th mastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, would be tried in New York City, was roundly rejected by the American public 51-29 percent.  Up until recent developments, this move may have been the hallmark of the anti-American presidency, granting rights afforded our citizens to a terrorist with single-minded designs on destroying those same citizens, speaks volumes.
                
                

            
                Whether it was inexperienced decision making early on, or recent ignorance of what the constituency supports, isn’t it about time that the president of the United States started implementing pro-American policies?  Isn’t it about time that he listen to the people that elected him?                
                

            
                Then again, that would require abandoning his liberal agenda and start accepting what America is – a predominantly conservative nation.

                One of the reasons our political structure has become dysfunctional no matter which party is in power is that too many of us are living in the moment. The closest we get to history is the instant replay.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is as if there is nothing the past can teach us; no wisdom that might be culled from those who have gone before. We buy guidebooks, or go online for information about countries or cities we plan to visit, trusting those who have been there to tell us the best places to stay, see and eat. When it comes to more momentous things, like health care, too many people believe government does best, regardless of historical and even contemporary evidence to the contrary.                
                

            
                The well-known quote ""That government is best which governs least,"" often attributed to Henry David Thoreau, has been supplanted in our day by the notion that government is my keeper, I shall not want.                
                

            
                All of the promises about health care ""reform"" are proving dubious at best. The move from insurance exchanges to single payer to the eventual takeover of the health care industry will happen incrementally, but inevitably, unless Republicans win back control of government and have the courage to repeal and replace ObamaCare with something better.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                What should awaken apathetic Americans is a story in last week's The New York Times headlined, ""Cost of Treatment May Influence Doctors."" The story said some of the country's largest medical groups are now suggesting that physicians consider cost when treating patients. The Times says a subtle shift is taking place within medicine as ""doctors are starting to redefine their roles, from being concerned exclusively about individual patients to exerting influence on how health care dollars are spent.""                
                

            
                In other words, are you ""worth"" being treated for cancer or other illnesses that can cost a lot of money? When government pressures health care providers to accept a utilitarian view of human life, it is a short step to government deciding whose life is worth living and whose is not.                
                

            
                When the dollar becomes almighty, the Almighty who creates life takes a backseat.                
                

            
                Promises that the misnamed Affordable Care Act would reduce costs are already being proved wrong. Health care spending is surging, according to another New York Times story. President Obama promised it would decline. We heard similar promises 50 years ago when Medicare was introduced. Politicians then promised costs would never exceed a certain level, which they did in very short order.                
                

            
                Critics of ObamaCare say one of its objectives is to put insurance companies out of business. The UnitedHealth Group is one of the nation's largest. It recently reported lower earnings and said the health care law is partially responsible.                
                

            
                The ""sound of inevitability,"" to quote from the film ""The Matrix,"" can be heard across the Atlantic. The National Health Service (NHS) continues to sputter as its experiment in socialized medicine produces horror stories that could be replicated in the United States if government is ever allowed to control not only insurance, but treatment.                
                

            
                A UK Daily Mail story tells of a great-grandmother who died in agony at Manchester Royal Infirmary. She suffered from a perforated bowel and while she screamed in pain for help she was told a nearby doctor, who was playing on a computer, ""wasn't on duty."" Stories of neglect, long waits for treatment, insensitivity toward patients and unusual numbers of deaths in some UK hospitals are no longer exceptions, but are increasingly common.                
                

            
                Why do so many have faith in government when government has a track record of failure and incompetence in the many tasks it undertakes? How can government be expected to miraculously acquire competence when it comes to health care?                
                

            
                Real faith is based on something substantive, not false hope. Government is a false god that history proves can't deliver on most of its promises.

It's time to protect our rights -- and our economy -- by ending health care mandates,"The majority of state Attorneys General have pointed out a fatal flaw in Obama care that the administration refuses to acknowledge: the administration has claimed a power that the Constitution does not grant.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                 
                

            
                The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the Attorneys General in their assertion that it is unconstitutional to force individuals to purchase health insurance. It didn’t matter which President appointed the judges who concurred with the AGs, be it Clinton or one of the Bushes.

                ‪A year ago, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had a moment of accidental clarity. She spoke with a reporter from The Hill about temporary waivers she was providing — more than 1,000 — to give certain groups a pass from complying with provisions of the new health care law.                
                

            
                “We don’t want to take away people’s health insurance before they have some realistic other choices,” Sebelius said.                
                

            
                Many of the waivers she’s talking about go to employers offering “mini-med” plans: those that offer a small amount of inexpensive coverage for low-wage workers. The plans will be banned under the new health care reform law.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Of course, during the debate about health care reform, Americans were promised that their current coverage wouldn’t be taken away. “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,” the president repeated. He also said Americans would ultimately save up to $2,500 per year on their health care coverage. In their wisdom, Americans never believed it, which is probably why ObamaCare has never found favor in the polls.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                ‪A troubling aspect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) touches on your constitutional protections, along with your health care coverage and costs.  Beginning in 2014, every American will be required to own a health insurance plan approved by the federal government. Attorneys generals and governors representing 29 states believe that the so-called “individual mandate” is an unconstitutional expansion of federal power that asserts near total control over your health care coverage. The mandate also demonstrates how the federal government, when it assumes powers it was never intended to have, micro-manages the personal decisions of every American.                
                

            
                Federal Judge Roger Vinson, in his ruling which struck down the individual health care mandate, pointed out that Congress ignored warnings from the Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office that the mandate would be unprecedented and constitutionally problematic. Congress essentially invited litigation.                
                

            
                Congressional staffers were likely troubled about the mandate’s legality because of questions about whether the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to compel all Americans to purchase a product in the private marketplace.  Under the clause, Congress has the limited power to regulate commerce among the states. It was originally intended to allow the federal government to eliminate trade barriers put up between states.                
                

            
                ‪A clause meant to spark trade and economic opportunity shouldn’t be used to the opposite effect when it comes to health care.  With the mandate in place, gone will be most policies that, for example, allow healthy people to buy inexpensive, catastrophic coverage.  Such policies prevent bankruptcies related to extended hospitalizations. Instead, Congress and the president require that every American have a plan that offers “free” preventative care, along with a long list of other minimum benefits. Resist and face an IRS fine.                
                

            
                What does it mean for you? You will pay more – not less, as promised – for your health care coverage. As the National Center for Policy Analysis reports, it costs less than $3,000 a year to cover the medical expenses of most Americans under 50. Yet, under the ACA, the minimum benefit package allowed will cost about $4,750.  Where will the $1,750 annual difference come from? If you’re lucky enough to be employed, it will come out of future raises. If you’re one of the 14 million unemployed Americans, there’s an even bigger price: when the cost of labor increases, employers think twice about new hires.                
                

            
                As has been widely reported, uncertainty about the economy, and how federal activism will play into potential growth, has companies sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash and other assets instead of investing in job-creating activities.  Congress exacerbated the problem by remaking one-sixth of the economy through a partisan process. Now, as the  constitutionally-questionable new law makes its way through the courts, other provisions – including billions in new taxes and government spending – roll out over a period of six years. And before that, another national election will decide control of the U.S. House, Senate and the White House. It’s no surprise that investors are waiting it out.                 
                

            
                A better approach would have sought bipartisan reforms. Make health care plans portable. Allow price competition by letting plans be sold across state lines. Create tax incentives for purchasing insurance instead of deploying IRS agents to seek out stragglers. These are some of the ideas supported by clear majorities of both parties. They leave constitutional protections in place.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                It’s not too late to change course and clear away at least some of the economic uncertainty caused by the ACA.  Congress should cancel individual mandate, resolving the biggest aspect of multi-state lawsuit.  It should focus instead on encouraging a stronger, less encumbered, national market for health insurance that provides consumers and employers with a greater array of affordable insurance options.                
                

            
                ‪                
                

            
                Our Constitution limits federal control, reserving certain powers for the federal government and leaving the rest reserved to the states – and to the people.  It’s a system that created the freest, most prosperous nation in the world. To bolster that freedom and prosperity, Congress and the president must act to pass health care reforms that respect our Constitutional rights, while providing more choices of affordable, portable health care plans. Our pocketbooks, and our health, will benefit.

                Remember how President Obama and the Democrats who passed Obamacare were going to “get” the insurance companies? Rhetorically, Obama set out to target big insurance companies—making them the bad guy was central to selling Obamacare as a plan that would help middle and lower class families.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But one of the dirty little secrets of Obamacare is that the biggest insurance companies were willing allies in the fight to pass the law, knowing that they stood to add hundreds of thousands of new members to their networks. And they have. The central part of Obamacare, the individual mandate, may be the most disliked component among the American people, but it is precisely what guarantees insurers new customers.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Today 95 percent of Bayonne [Medical Center's] patients are covered by some type of insurance payment, a very high percentage compared to other urban hospitals.

                Of course, these new customers have brought with them profit growth for the insurance industry in leaps and bounds. In 2013, the value of the S&P health insurance index gained 43 percent. Major insurers have seen their revenues rise by billions every year since the passage of Obamacare.                
                

            
                And yet, this comes as middle class and working families continue to be squeezed by rising health care costs. As illustrated last week, “government data show that health care costs are the biggest driver of income inequality in America today.” Pay increases are being eaten up by rising healthcare costs, including higher insurance premiums, and the shrinking American middle class suffers.                
                

            
                Some in the insurance industry appear to not be content with the advantage that they won under Obamacare, which obscures prices for the average consumer/patient even more than before the law was passed. Insurance companies and providers are incentivized to use artificially high price points to start, and end up negotiating a “discounted” middle-ground.

                These pricing schemes just add to string of hits on middle and low income families. Providers who dare to look at better ways to implement sound business practices in order to remain operationally viable can find themselves under attack.                
                

            
                For example, one urban hospital in New Jersey, Bayonne Medical Center, has found itself in the crosshairs for seeking to negotiate a more sane pricing structure.                
                

            
                Policy expert Ryan Ellis provides his assessment:                
                

            
                Two recent screaming headlines from the U.K.’s Daily Mail (“That’s painful! New Jersey hospital charges man nearly $9,000 to treat a CUT on his middle finger”) and the New York Times (“New Jersey Hospital Has Highest Billing Rates in the Nation”) were clearly planted as a negotiating leverage tactic by Big Insurance. The hope is to cow providers into charging less in the fake first bill so that the “discount” results in lower payments to providers/bigger profits for insurance companies.                
                

            
                Not long ago, Bayonne Medical Center was on the verge of closing its doors after decades of financial struggle—no surprise when one considers just how much strain medical facilities face in underserved areas. In fact, Hudson County, where Bayonne is located, has the highest rate of uninsured, underinsured, and Medicaid patients in New Jersey.                
                

            
                Bayonne is now on more solid financial footing thanks to new investment, restructuring of management practices, and the negotiation of a more fair reimbursement plan with insurers. Bayonne reached contract agreements with all of the nearly all insurance providers, including the New Jersey’s largest. Today 95 percent of Bayonne's patients are covered by some type of insurance payment, a very high percentage compared to other urban hospitals.                 
                

            
                But as Ellis have points out, suddenly there appears to be a coordinated attack designed to pressure Bayonne into giving in to insurance providers with whom they have yet to reach a pricing agreement.                
                

            
                In the current health care environment in which working families are being subjected to strains on their budget and ultimately their well-being, it would seem that health care providers who operate in underserved communities, especially those that are efficient and price effective, could be held up as a model of success. Instead, they face sensationalist headlines designed to create pressure on them to succumb to pricing demands.                
                

            
                All of this just adds to the long list of reasons why the American people need health care reform that puts patients and families in charge of their health care, as opposed to politicians, bureaucrats, and third-party payers. The sooner that real health care reform is passes the better for all of us.

Challenges and joys facing America's small businesses,"A new small business starts with an idea, but in between that first dream and the first sale there are lots of obstacles. Still, millions of Americans open their own business every year. This creativity and persistence of small business owners fuels our economy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                According to the Census Bureau, 99.7 percent of U.S. businesses are small employers and these small businesses employ about half of all private sector employees. Small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of net new jobs in the last two decades.                
                

            
                Yet in recent years small employers have faced a host of new hurdles to overcome before they can open their doors or make their website go live. They add up quickly, blocking attempts to start up or forcing some longtime owners to close their doors.  Among the hardest for small businesses to clear are federal regulations, federal taxes and the rising cost of health insurance.                
                

            
                No one goes into business because they like filling out government paperwork, yet Washington has been engaged in a great effort to pile up new regulations. In fact there are currently thousands of proposed rules awaiting approval and many will affect small business directly.                 
                

            
                One such proposal would drastically expand the Clean Water Act, for the first time giving the federal government jurisdiction over private ponds, seasonal streams, usually dry creek beds and other bodies of water.  If the White House approves the rule, farmers and local business owners will have to apply to the EPA to do anything on their own land that might affect a nearby water source.  It’ll add tens of thousands of dollars to small projects and lead invariably to potentially devastating lawsuits brought by activists.                
                

            
                The complexity of the tax code, which now exceeds 70,000 pages, is another major barrier to growth. NFIB research calculates that tax paperwork costs small businesses $74 an hour. That’s 67 percent higher than what the average cost of compliance is for big businesses.  And according to the IRS the typical small business now devotes 24 hours per year just on tax preparation.                  
                

            
                Of course, high tax rates inhibit growth, too, by siphoning away money that small businesses would otherwise invest.  President Obama and some members of Congress have proposed a cut in the corporate income tax rate.  But that would exclude three quarters of small businesses who file as individuals.  Those small businesses, many of which pay the top rate of 39.6 percent, create more jobs than corporations and they pay a larger share of federal taxes.  Cutting small business income tax rates would free up capital, stimulate demand and strongly encourage job creation.  It would also simplify the process for small business owners and give them time to focus on growth.                
                

            
                Among the barriers for small business perhaps the most worrisome is the spiraling cost of health care.  In the last decade, average health insurance premiums for small firms have increased 63 percent.  Small business owners hoped that health care reform would reduce the cost of insurance.  Instead, Obamacare made it more expensive.  Sixty-two percent of small businesses we surveyed claimed that per employee premium costs were higher in mid-2014 than in mid-2013. Statistics for the previous year were similar too. In 2014, only 40 percent of small employers offer employer-sponsored health insurance, down six points from the previous year.                
                

            
                Obamacare created 21 new taxes, new mandatory coverages and new red tape that has reduced the choices available to small business owners. One of the worst of these new taxes is the Health Insurance Tax. This tax falls on the fully insured market, where 88 percent of small businesses purchase their coverage. While the tax is on the insurers, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has stated that this increase will get passed on to customers in the form of higher premiums. Our own research shows that private sector employment could by more than 262,000 jobs in the next seven years. Nearly two-thirds of these losses would be at small businesses.                
                

            
                Despite all these obstacles, there is still much to celebrate during Small Business Week. Millions of small business owners are working hard to provide for themselves and their families. They are contributing to their communities by doing things like sponsoring sports leagues, keeping their neighborhood clean, and so much more. There is incredible fulfillment in watching something that you started grow and thrive. As long as this country lets individuals profit from their creativity and industry, there will be people who sacrifice to make their dreams come true. We are all better off because of them.

Will Obamacare's 'Bottom Up' Growth Make America Go Belly Up?,"If the health care reform and its aftermath mean anything, it is the calculated attempt to address inequality in the nation, a matter that surfaced during the presidential campaign and an issue that goes to the heart of this administration’s game plan.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The presumptive gap between rich and poor has been the catalyst for the Obama obsession with the redistribution of wealth. Mr. Obama claimed that health reform would “mark a new season in America.” He added, “We have now just enshrined…the core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care.”                
                

            
                Leave aside for the moment whether the health care legislation provides this basic security and, of course, its effect on the quality of care, the notable portion of the money to pay for this bill will come from payroll taxes on households making $250,000 or more. On average, the annual tax burden for households making a million dollars will rise by $40,000. Another source of financing will come from cutting Medicare subsides for private insurance, ultimately affecting their executives and shareholders.                
                

            
                By contrast, the benefits of the bill flow mostly to households making less than four times the poverty level. Those without insurance in this group will become eligible to receive subsidies or to join Medicaid.                 
                

            
                Of course, many of the poor are already covered by Medicaid, but this bill extends coverage dramatically. The bill will also suggest that healthy people will be coerced into buying insurance, thereby subsidizing those who heretofore did not have insurance or had preexisting conditions that militated against coverage.                
                

            
                While Mr. Obama has commended President Reagan for “changing the trajectory of America,” this bill has changed America, period. From the trickle down view of the economy, Obama has instituted bottom up growth, a theory without an empirical basis. As the president now sees it, class warfare is not only desirable, it is a way to redress economic disparities. Presumably the laissez-faire foundation that Reagan commenced will be undone brick by brick with Obama led redistributionist schemes.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, class warfare of the kind President Obama has in mind cannot possibly generate the goals for which he is aiming. Raising taxes to extortionate levels does not produce additional revenue for the government.                 
                

            
                Beyond a certain point, wealthy people work less, and earn less or put their assets offshore, but they will find a way to avoid the coercive reach of Uncle Sam.                 
                

            
                What the Obama administration seems to ignore are the incentives that drive economic growth. As Abraham Lincoln noted, “You can’t make a poor man rich by making a rich man poor.” How can an economy grow when the catalysts for growth are thwarted by the extensive reach and policy orientation of government?                
                

            
                Establishing the proper balance between the market and government is never easy. But in the case of President Obama, we have a leader motivated by ideology to tilt the equation in the direction of government control. If the prescribed way of dealing with unemployment and unfunded liabilities is economic growth, the president’s polices insure the opposite.                 
                

            
                It is not coincidental that the nation’s founders put a premium on opportunity and free markets recognizing full well that a market dominated system will invariably result in disparate rewards that encourage inequality. Economic equality can only be achieved by political engineers who take from some and give to others.                
                

            
                Should one parse the language of President Obama, this egalitarian agenda is his goal. Health care reform is merely one manifestation of his plan for the future. Surely he is not the first to attempt this quasi-Marxist economic vision. But we know from vast experience in Europe and the Soviet Union that the result of this quest is a stagnant economy, invidious comparisons and slow to non-existent economic growth.                
                

            
                Frederick Brown, writing in Harpers magazine, in 1981, said, “It could be said that each leftist generation reinvents, with such material as the age suggests, a lost utopia, an ancien regime, and a new order: each one finds its soul in evangelical distinctions between a ‘before’ and an ‘after’.”                
                

            
                President Obama is apparently searching for his lost utopia unwilling to recognize what came before and willfully shopping for a new tomorrow.

Don't Let Debate Over Money Destroy Health Care Reform,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                What will health care reform cost?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This question has become the obsession distracting us from the moral imperative to provide health care to all Americans.                
                

            
                The richest, most powerful, most amazing nation in the world should treat its citizens who fall ill better than some broken Third World country. If we can afford to try to rebuild Afghanistan with little hope of success, then arguing about paying for Americans to have health coverage seems petty.                
                

            
                Yet no topic has gotten more ink during the health care debate than cost.                
                

            
                Just like the Iraq war debate where everyone was up in arms about how it was going to cost us billions of dollars a year. . . . Oh, wait -- that never happened.                
                

            
                Why? Because the people who supported the war -- at the time the majority of Americans and Congress members -- believed that our very lives were at risk and that invading Iraq was imperative to protecting American lives.                
                

            
                Anyone suggesting that we should consider costs is met with complete derision. Cost doesn't matter when Ameri can lives are at stake, was the mantra.                
                

            
                I actually agree with that sentiment. I just didn't agree that Saddam Hussein posed a threat to America.                
                

            
                But now there is extensive empirical evidence that tens of thousands of Americans lose their lives each year from lack of health insurance -- yet all we hear is whining about the cost.                
                

            
                You think I'm exaggerating?                
                

            
                The non-partisan Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences, estimated in 2002 -- when fewer Americans were uninsured than are today -- that 18,000 adults age 25-64 died in 2000 because they were uninsured. Based on the IOM's methodology and later Census Bureau estimates of insurance coverage, the Urban Institute finds that from 2000 to 2006, 137,000 people died due to lack of health insurance -- 22,000 in 2006 alone.                
                

            
                A Harvard study published in the November issue of Archives of Surgery found that uninsured patients with traumatic injuries (like car crashes, falls and gunshot wounds) were almost twice as likely to die in the hospital as similarly injured patients with health insurance.                
                

            
                Elmer Huerta, oncologist and the president of the American Cancer Society, says the uninsured are twice as likely as the insured to have advanced cancer when they first see a doctor. And if you don't catch cancer early, things rarely turn out well.                
                

            
                The Bush administration felt no compunction about brushing off the rare inquiries about the potential expense of the Iraq war with vague comments about Iraqi oil revenues covering the cost. Instead of getting mired in a losing argument, it focused on the big picture: Americans will die if we don't do something about Saddam.

Romney for President? What's a Tea Party Voter to Do in 2012?,"Having spent the last several days in the Granite State I am even more puzzled now than I was late last week when I began pondering this new reality: ""The Tea Party is dead.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I don't know what happened between November of 2010 and January of 2012. Does anyone?                
                

            
                How else do you explain it?                
                

            
                Rewind to November of 2010, race after race, congressional seat after congressional seat, governorship after governorship.                 
                

            
                Only a little more than eighteen months after President Obama had packed the mall in Washington for his historic inaugural, The Tea Party held it's historic event in which nearly the same size audience--according to maps supplied by the USA Today--had attended. That event catapulted a state by state tsunami-like momentum where grassroots, low tax, small government, pro-founding principles, pro-life, pro-national security, and pro-God forces aligned and an election victory of historic equivalence shook America in 2010.                
                

            
                The driving force of that agitation then as it is still today was the effect of a poor economy, government intervention, federal overreach, bureaucratic mandates, and punitive taxes on the nation's beleaguered small business community. Entitlements, bail-outs, and criminally reckless spending ensued.                
                

            
                The Tea Party believed that the buffoons authoring the mess should be dealt a blow. And in 2010 they leveled power in the Congress.                
                

            
                The single biggest example of this overreach was for Washington politicians, behind closed doors, with no transparency, to take a health care reform law--deem it as passed--and force upon the American people the worst piece of legislation to be passed since World War II.                
                

            
                ""ObamaCare"", as it would soon be called, was and is at this very moment--in this election cycle--the singular most visible sign that this nation must take a different course.                
                

            
                Some very good people got elected in 2010 to attempt to help lay the groundwork for the complete repeal of ObamaCare. Rising star Governor Nikki Haley in South Carolina, and Senator-soon-to-be-the-next-Vice-President Marco Rubio rode the shoulders of these Tea Party votes, and pledged with their victories to return power to the voice of ""We the People."" The failed candidacies of Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell were also propped up almost entirely by the support of these first amendment patriots who simply wished to keep government in check.                
                

            
                Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin rallied these troops, showed up and helped them raise cash, enthusiasm, and enlistments.'                
                

            
                 The numbers of the Tea Party were tens of thousands of times bigger than the largest Occupy Wall Street gatherings--combined!                
                

            
                Yet only a little over a year later and the goal of the Tea Party to complete it's work and overturn ObamaCare is all but dead.                
                

            
                In 2010 Ann Coulter was making speeches at CPAC warning that if we chose the candidate who had authored ObamaCare to become the nominee, then President Obama would be easily re-elected. She was right of course.                
                

            
                But somewhere along the line instead of being bold, defiant, grassroots, and in control, someone started feeding voters the meme that the man who saw to it that $50 state-subsidized abortions were included in his vision of mandated government health care, was the best of the available choices.                
                

            
                Even Ann Coulter 2.0 drank the Kool-Aid.                
                

            
                Worse yet the choices that are left in the race are establishment folks who feasted on earmarks for a living in Pennsylvania, embraced government involvement in the biggest hoax of our time--man-made global warming, or finally the man that as governor of Massachusetts raised taxes on everything from gasoline to ""certificates of blindness."" (No it's real... Look it up.)                
                

            
                Your humble correspondant has predicted an easy path that Obama's forces will take to pummel him the candidacy of Mitt Romney into tapioca.                
                

            
                My sources, campaign strategists who consult for the Obama team, confirm that the White House is getting the GOP candidate it wants most.                
                

            
                I need to remind you that the win in Iowa meant strategically nothing. Those delegates will go to whoever the likely nominee is, and won't even be assigned until the convention.                 
                

            
                New Hampshire has a puny amount of delegate votes--but at least they will be genuine delegates.                 
                

            
                This year South Carolina is where the battle truly begins. South Carolina has more delegates than Iowa and New Hampshire combined and Tea Party strongholds from Virginia all the way around the coast to Texas are delegate rich battlegrounds.                
                

            
                The two biggest priorities for primary voters are to decide which candidate can make Washington as inconsequential to the life of the average American as possible, and who can challenge President Obama directly on the worst legislation of our time--ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney has no track record that would point to being able to accomplish either of these. Even a small whiff of a challenge on ObamaCare by Romney will be followed up with an Obama ""thank you"" note for writing the health care law for him.                
                

            
                It is almost impossible to believe and downright sickening to accept that in light of the clear mandate of the Tea Party that the GOP stands on the cusp of returning to ""establishmentarianism."" But it appears that for all the big talk, tens of thousands of local rallies, and the single largest non-inaugural event to ever occur on our nation's mall, the Tea Party has died.                
                

            
                Which is sad. And it's sad for me personally as a supporter, because I believed in the movement and I even addressed those patriots, on that mall, that cloudy Washington day.                
                

            
                That first tea party in Washington took place exactly three days after President Obama's address to a Joint Session of Congress, where he had instructed his supporters on ObamaCare to go ""get in people's faces"" if they disagreed with the policy. He told his critics that he was calling them out.                
                

            
                I remember bringing that little point to the attention of the close to 1.2 million gathered on the mall that afternoon. The chants of ""Here we are, Here we are, Here we are"" rang in my ears for days.                
                

            
                Sadly now I wonder, ""Where'd we go?""

Lessons for Romney's Rivals As 2012 Presidential Campaign Heats Up,"At the GOP debate last week in New Hampshire Mitt Romney issued a school-yard, bad-ass, you-want-some of-this challenge to President Obama.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                “I can’t wait to debate President Obama on health care” he declared.                
                

            
                Then with a distinct cockiness, Gov. Romney added that he wants to ask the president: “Why didn’t you give me a call and ask what worked and what didn’t?”                
                

            
                That is pretty extraordinary given that President Obama’s Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) operates on the very same principles as the plan that Romney put in place during his time as governor of Massachusetts. Not a single Republican voted to support the president’s national version of Romney’s Massachusetts plan. And Republican opposition to the Romney-like plan set a political fire to the Tea Party movement and led to the GOP gaining the majority of the House in the 2010 mid-terms.                
                

            
                All of that is enough to create surprise at hearing Romney boast to Republicans that he wants to engage the issue. But it is even more stunning for people who know Romney’s checkered history with political debates.                
                

            
                As the sportscaster Warner Wolf says – “Let’s Go to Videotape!”                
                

            
                The climax of Romney’s 1994 Senate campaign against the late Massachusetts Sen. Teddy Kennedy was a televised debate between the two candidates in Boston’s historic Faneuil Hall.                 
                

            
                Heading into the debate, polls had Romney and Kennedy in a tight race and some political analysts said out loud Kennedy was in real danger of losing the Senate seat that he had held for three decades.                
                

            
                In the debate, Romney attacked Kennedy with charges that some of his family’s real estate holdings had benefited from government subsidies. Kennedy somberly replied: “Mr. Romney, my family did not enter public service for the money. And frankly, we’ve paid too high a price for it.”                
                

            
                Kennedy was of course referring to his two older brothers – President John F. Kennedy and Senator Bobby Kennedy – who were both assassinated.                
                

            
                Romney was caught flat-footed and he ultimately lost the election by 17 points.                
                

            
                And that was not the only moment when the debate went badly for Romney. As abortion was discussed, Romney professed to be pro-choice and at the same time pro-life in his personal beliefs. Sen. Kennedy walloped Romney by saying: “I am pro-choice. My opponent is multiple choice.”                
                

            
                Later, as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, Romney tried to maintain a precarious balance between his personal pro-life beliefs and pro-choice policies in his administration.                
                

            
                That is, until he was running for the 2008 Republican nomination, when he stressed his pro-life credentials to anyone who would listen.                
                

            
                Political consultant Dick Morris termed his position a “flip-flop-flip” adding that in politics, “you only get to change your mind once on abortion.”                
                

            
                Also in that 1994 debate that Romney vowed he would do more to promote gay rights than Senator Kennedy. But later as governor, Romney was one of the earliest and most ardent opponents of same sex marriage.                
                

            
                Though Romney has undoubtedly grown and matured as a candidate since that debate performance, the lesson for his GOP rivals – and President Obama (if Romney wins the GOP nomination) -- is that debating does not appear to be one of the former governor’s strong points.

And that's why it was surprising that in last week’s Republican debate Romney’s challengers for the nomination treated him if they were in a boxing ring with the young Muhammad Ali.                
                

            
                Moderator John King gave former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty a perfect opening to attack Romney on his Achilles heel – health care. Pawlenty did not take it. Instead, he reverted to Obama-bashing rather than criticizing Romney.

Pawlenty had previously described President Obama’s health care reform package as “Obamney-care” – referring to the similarities between Obama’s health law and the one enacted by governor.                
                

            
                Pawlenty later said he regretted not taking the opportunity to engage Romney.                
                

            
                President Obama is not likely to be so deferential. If the president ever does get the chance to debate Romney and Romney asks why he did not call him before passing the health care plan, Obama need only reply: “Because I wasn’t sure which Mitt Romney would answer the phone.”                
                

            
                And then President Obama may well be on his way to another Kennedy-style landslide victory.

Pelosi's Arrogance Knows No Bounds,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Several public opinion surveys over the last ten or eleven months make it clear the American people do not want the health care reform legislation currently before Congress to pass. It’s a sea change in the public’s attitude since from the days immediately following the 2008 election, when Democrats from the newly-elected Barack Obama on down universally proclaimed that the people had given them a mandate, that they had embraced the idea that the government should increase its control of the health care system and, with it, nearly one-sixth of the U.S. economy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Those claims were smoke and mirrors then and they are smoke and mirrors now. Utilizing a process that, contrary to the claims of leading Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has been anything but transparent, a bill has been produced full of special interest carve outs, tax increases and pork-laden political payoffs that, according to those who have studied the bill closely, will only make matters worse.

The American public has grown cynical about the whole business. Who can blame them -- especially when a majority of those in Congress will not even promise to read the bill before voting on it? Unfortunately for the people’s interests, the trickery appears to be getting worse. Nothing exemplifies the contempt that Speaker Pelosi has for the public and everyone outside her little circle of intimidated puppets better than her arrogant assertion that “we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.” What she calls the fog of controversy is actually the process of painstakingly deciphering 2,700 pages of arcane obfuscation. The bill contains one simple reality that Pelosi and team desperately want to conceal: it will dramatically expand government’s reach into the private sector of our economy and dramatically reduce individual liberty.

Up to now, political analysts on both sides of the aisle believed the only way to get a bill to President Obama’s desk for his signature was if the House voted to approve, without amendment, the health care bill that passed the Senate last Christmas. And enough votes could be secured to do that only if the House and Senate leadership -- in order to win the votes of Democrats who continued to have concerns about provisions included in the Senate bill like the infamous “Cornhusker Kickback” and its lack of sufficient protections to block federal funds from being used to pay for abortion and abortion-related services – promised to fix the issues that caused them concern through a legislative process known as “reconciliation.” But that may no longer be the case.

In another arrogant display of legislative power and contempt for the ordinary citizen, Rep. Louise Slaughter – the Pelosi ally who chairs the all powerful House Rules Committee – is said to be preparing the way for the Senate health care bill to pass the House without ever being voted on in order to overcome the fact that they don’t have the votes to pass it.

According to National Journal’s Congress Daily, Slaughter is giving serious consideration to a plan that would "" usher the health care overhaul through the House and potentially avoid a direct vote on the Senate overhaul bill” by manipulating the rules of the chamber in such a way that the Senate bill would be “deemed” as having passed once the House approves a bill that would make the corrections certain members want.                
                

            
                It is now more apparent than ever that Pelosi and Reid are the White House are committed to passing the health care bill by whatever means necessary, even if they have to pull the wool over the public’s eyes to do it. In essence, members of the House are being asked to base their next vote on health care on a bill they and the American people have not read and which has not, as yet, been written.

Congress’s arrogance has been on full display throughout this debate, making clear that it will pass a healthcare bill that a majority of Americans oppose by any means necessary. Now, more than ever in this debate it is important that the everyone say “no!” to this kind of political chicanery in a loud, clear and united voice. What the Democrats are doing is no longer simply a matter of passing a bill; they are threatening to undermine 200 years of legislative process and Democratic traditions in order to get their way.

GROVER NORQUIST: We Don't Need Another Post Office,"Last fall Barack Obama campaigned promising change. Many Americans wanted change. They wanted to change Washington. But Obama meant something very different. He wanted to use Washington to change America. Having the government take over hospitals, doctors, health insurance and life and death decisions is not what most Americans thought they were voting for.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                President Obama began his presidency with very high approval ratings.  But as Americans watched him take over the banks with bailouts, and take over the car companies with bailouts and spend almost a trillion dollars for a Ã¢â‚¬Â¦stimulus spending package of expensive earmarks and sign a budget with another trillion in new spending-- with some nine trillion dollars now to be added to the national debt--the idea of having government take over health care began to look less and less wise.                
                

            
                When Obama said Ã¢â‚¬Â¦""reform"" he clearly meant Ã¢â‚¬Â¦""take over."" Reform the auto companies. Reform the banking system.  Obama would use our tax dollars so he could buy and control whole industries.                 
                

            
                When Americans began questioning what Obama and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi were doing they found themselves insulted by the politicians who didnÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t like the rabble asking pesky questions.  Barack Obama doesnÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢t like his inferiors asking questions like--will the Democrat Congressmen who vote for a Ã¢â‚¬Â¦public option on health care actually live with that public option--or is the public option just for little people?                
                

            
                President Obama was brutally honest when he said the government run Ã¢â‚¬Â¦public option would be like the Post Office.  We have, Obama pointed out, a government run post office and privately run UPS and FedEx.  Therefore you have choice.  Sort of.  The federal government taxes UPS and FedEx.  The government-run post office does not pay federal or state corporate income taxes or local property taxes.  FedEx and UPS do.  And it is against the law for you to try and send a first class letter through anyone other than the post office.  Well if the government option can tax its competitors and can pass laws to create a monopoly--how is this real choice?                
                

            
                Obama also has a problem because many Americans have friends or relatives with some experience with government run health care in Canada or Britain where the government rations care by making citizens wait to see a doctor, take a test or use a CAT scan or MRI.  In Britain, one waits an average of 70 days for cataract surgery, 68 days for bypass surgery, 99 days for hernia repair (ouch), 113 days for tonsillectomy.  Median wait times in Canada from general practitioner to seeing a specialist is 9.4 weeks for gynecology. It is on average another 7 weeks between seeing the specialist and getting treatment.                  
                

            
                Would the U.S. government ration health care if they ran the health care system? Well, president Obama has already given us the answer. The post office, his model for a public health care system, is losing money (Interesting question how a monopoly loses money). What is the post office response to losing money?  Becoming more efficient? No. They will ration post office care by closing on Saturdays. Years ago they rationed by ending twice daily delivery of the mail.  Now when you get sick, the government may be closed on Saturdays. Rationing. No fun if you are sick.                             
                

            
                Obama promised that health care reform would reduce your insurance costs. And give insurance coverage to 49 million folks with no insurance.  Sounded good. Sounded painless.  If you were happy with your insurance nothing would change.  But now we learn that the government needs one, two or maybe three trillion dollars to give us this new lower-costing health care.  If it costs less, what are all the trillions of higher taxes going towards?   And now that we read the fine print, we find that there are four general tax hikes in the House of Representatives health care bill.  Not just taxes on the rich but on those making less than $250,000 a year, a blatant violation of Obama's central campaign promise not to raise Ã¢â‚¬Â¦""any formof taxes on these families.  And new regulations will prevent 30 million American families with flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts from purchasing over the counter medicines.  And Medicare will be raided by taking away choices for seniors. You and I are going to pay through the nose for this experiment.                
                

            
                All this pain for what?                
                

            
                For the past eight years Democrats have been voting against and filibustering two important reforms that would help all Americans.  First, allowing you to buy your health insurance from any of the 50 states. Right now you are stuck buying insurance from businesses in your state, often with expensive mandates pushed on you by the state legislators and lobbyists for special interests  This reform alone, known as the Shadegg bill, would drop the cost of health care an average of 15%.  Not bad.  Democrats have spent years opposing this fix.                
                

            
                Second, we need to reform tort law--stop the trial lawyer billionaires from suing your doctor and hospital to push up the costs of your health care.  Obama, Reid and Pelosi owe the trial lawyer billionaires a great deal. They cannot say no to them. So no reform there.  Some suggest that such reforms would save billions in legal fees but also tens of billions in lower costs of so called Ã¢â‚¬Â¦""defensive medicine"" forced by the trial lawyers.                
                

            
                And lastly, Republicans are putting forward legislation that would require all hospitals to post their actual prices for operations on the Internet so we can shop around--like we do with everything else in life.  That would generate real price competition that does not exist in today-- highly regulated health care.                
                

            
                Health care is too expensive in America. That is because it is taxed, regulated and sued too much.  We need less government in between us and our doctors. Fewer parasitical trial lawyers and more competition free from government created monopolies.                
                

            
                One government run post office is already too many.

Gambling With Our Very Lives -- A Senior's Take on ObamaCare One Year Later,"The one-year anniversary of the passage of ObamaCare arrives Wednesday and as I reflect on the battle that gave us this bill and everything that’s happened since, I am reminded of the game liar's poker. Liar's poker is a game of chance made famous by Michael Lewis’ book of the same name, where players use any tactic to convince their opponent they have a stronger hand than they really have.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                So why am I reminded of liar's poker? President Obama came to office promising to better our health care system and fiscal discipline but instead has played “liar’s poker” with the American people. Desperate to substantiate claims that his trillion-dollar health care entitlement plan would somehow save taxpayers money, the White House fudged the numbers.                
                

            
                Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius’ recent admission that the administration “double counted” Medicare savings in order to pass health care reform was just one example of the duplicity that was conducted to ensure the bill became law.                
                

            
                This is upsetting and insulting particularly to America’s seniors. As a senior citizen myself, I can tell you that life changes with aging. Even those of us in the best of shape begin to ache in odd places and find that we can’t do everything we could a few years ago. Health and health care are no longer abstract concepts. They are parts of our daily lives. For many, access to health care is a question of downright survival.                
                

            
                That’s what makes this game of liar’s poker so frustratingly frightening for millions of seniors. To politicians and policy wonks, health care is an ideological issue. And the president’s health care scheme is a grand experiment. But seniors understand the real world impact this experiment will have if the ObamaCare numbers don’t work —and it is now painfully clear that they never will. Inevitably, care and treatment will be rationed because denying access to care and treatment is really the only way government can “reduce its costs.” It’s that simple.                
                

            
                This is not the stuff of B-grade horror movies. These types of decisions about care and treatment are made everyday in countries with a government-run health care system. And experience has repeatedly demonstrated that when care is rationed, the elderly and the sick are hardest hit.                
                

            
                To those who say that this could never happen in America, I would point out that it already is.
In the fall of 2010, a senior breast cancer patient in South Carolina told me about the impact that a devastating decision by the Food and Drug Administration will have on her life. Avastin is an expensive life-extending drug that she depends on, literally to keep her alive. In order to “bend the cost curve,” as the president has demanded, the FDA wants to allow Medicare and insurance companies to deny coverage for the drug in order to save money. Medicare would save millions of dollars if it doesn’t have to cover the cost of Avastin but it would be a death sentence for this woman in South Carolina and thousands of breast cancer patients like her. This is the sad reality of government-run health care and the Avastin decision appears to be only the opening crack in the rationing door.                
                

            
                The sick are being targeted as well. The president of the AIDS Health Foundation blasted President Obama's 2012 budget proposal for ""rationing"" lifesaving drugs, even though the community he serves has historically been among the President's most ardent supporters.                
                

            
                If one of the president's most loyal constituencies is up in arms over rationing, you can bet we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg, and just a taste of how rationing will become the norm as it is in countries with socialist health care systems.                
                

            
                So while some may be wishing ObamaCare a happy first anniversary, those who are paying attention are wishing it good riddance. Unless common sense returns to our nation’s capitol, ObamaCare is repealed and overall spending is brought under control, seniors will inevitably find their drugs and care are rationed. And that makes the current health care and budget fights more critical than ever – not only for breast cancer and AIDS patients who have become the Guinea pigs in an experiment to “reduce the cost of health care” – but for future generations of Americans who will be buried in an avalanche of debt.                
                

            
                Jim Martin, 75, is Chairman of 60 Plus Association and worked on Capitol Hill in 1965 when Medicare passed. 60 Plus is in its 19th year and relies on more than seven million seniors for support."
"Mr. President, Please Press Pause","AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Reading the health care reform press coverage today and over the weekend must have been very frustrating for Democrats and encouraging for Republicans. Despite pulling out all the stops, including a rushed-looking presidential statement in the Rose Garden late Friday afternoon, America just isn't buying it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Sometimes presidents have to stick to their principles and lead by making decisions that might not be popular, but I don't think that this version of health care reform fits such a scenario. ""We need a win"" is not a principle, and the Democrats would have been better off if they'd not let that narrative gain the substantial ground it now enjoys.                
                

            
                President Obama holds considerable good will with a majority of Americans, though as they learn more about the policy details they are resisting most of his suggested changes. It strikes me that he should consider asking the State Department to make him a new button -- one that would allow him to hit pause. Then he could regroup and encourage a bipartisan healthcare reform bill that could perhaps go somewhere besides the potential for it to go down in flames.                
                

            
                I know this wouldn't be popular with a lot of people, but it could prevent further erosion of support for the general consensus from both parties that the status quo is unacceptable.                
                

            
                
To me, it's like they're trying to pound a square peg into a round hole. It will not fit. And if you force the peg through, everything around it will break -- making other important issues harder to fix.                
                

            
                My advice is to stop pounding...we're all getting headaches. Pull back and either square the circle or circle the square before trying again.

Three Reasons Why This Republican Is Optimistic,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Optimism. It is a sentiment that has been missing from the ranks of the Republican Party since before the 2006 midterm elections and one which is primed for a comeback.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Notwithstanding the negative commentary about the state of the Party, I am optimistic about the outcome for the Republican Party in both the 2010 Congressional elections and the 2012 presidential campaign.                
                

            
                First, I am optimistic based on a personal experience. Recently, I attended a fundraiser for Gov. Pawlenty's Freedom First PAC in Washington, D.C. The event brought out Republicans of all ages and backgrounds to a venue located just a stone's throw away from the Capitol. The over-capacity crowd, ranging from McCain campaign veterans to high school students who are interested in getting involved in politics for the first time, was full of energy, enthusiasm and determination. The conversations centered not just on Governor Pawlenty and his future, but also the good chances of Republicans in this week's governors races, as well as optimism about 2010 and 2012 and conviction that the Republican ideals of small government and personal responsibility will bring the Party back to power. A downtrodden party does not have gatherings like this one. -- A party that is ready for a comeback does.                
                

            
                Second, I am optimistic because history and the Democrats' most recent job performance are all working to the Republican advantage. The last two presidents to come in with their party controlling both houses of Congress were Jimmy Carter in 1977 and Bill Clinton in 1993. In 1978 Republicans made strong gains in both Houses of Congress and in 1981 Ronald Reagan moved into the White House. In 1994 the Republicans swept to a majority in both Houses led by Newt Gingrich and his Contract for America. The Democrats' performance in Congress and the White House should not give them any comfort that history will not be repeated in 2010. Without any tangible successes by Congressional Democrats in the last year, it is safe to say, and many Democrat strategists agree, that Democrats will lose seats in both Houses in 2010, and may lose control of said Houses if their performance and approval ratings do not improve dramatically.                
                

            
                Third, looking ahead to 2012, President Obama has followed the lead of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi by making a lot of speeches and announcing drastic changes in every area ranging from financial system overhaul to health care reform. But any actual achievement by the president is hard to pinpoint and a 25 point drop in approval ratings is the result of such dearth of successes. What in February looked like a signed, sealed and delivered reelection is now tenuous at best. The president has to succeed on two out of three fronts â€“ the economy, Afghanistan/Iraq and health care in order to have a strong chance to stay in the White House, and if the first nine months are an indicator, that will not happen.                
                

            
                While some point to a lack of a clear front runner for the Republican nomination for 2012 as a problem, I believe a wide field with candidates ranging from strongly conservative to moderate will energize all the various wings of our Party, and that energy from the whole Republican spectrum will be channeled into winning the general election based on a coalition similar to those enjoyed by Reagan in 1980 and 1984.                
                

            
                The last four years have not been easy for the Republican Party but it is important to remember that just because elections have been lost, that does not mean that the main principals of conservativism have been defeated. After all, the latest Gallup poll states that conservatives outnumber liberals in this country by 20%, and that is another reason for optimism as we look to 2010, 2012 and beyond.

18 Ways of Looking at Obama,"Fri, 15 May 2009 01:25:46 +0000 –  By Jon KrausharCommunications Consultant                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                
                

            
                In his commencement address at Arizona State University on May 13, President Obama said that, ""building a body of work...is about the daily labor, the many individual acts, the choices large and small that add up to a lasting legacy.""                
                

            
                As he fulfills this definition in his presidency, let's look at eighteen hard and soft positions belonging to Barack Obama and his administration to evaluate whether--so far--the results are good or bad for the country.                
                

            
                1. ENEMIES LIST

 Softon condemning radical Islamic terrorism (even to the point that Obama's Homeland Security Secretary avoids the term, preferring ""man-caused disasters"").
                
                

            
                2. TERRORISM

 Softon explaining what will happen if released terrorists do more harm at home or abroad and also explaining how easing up on captured terrorists helps prevent future attacks that are as bad as or worse than September 11, 2001.
                
                

            
                3. MIDDLE EAST

 Softon justifying why more money should be given to those who pay little or no taxes (while assuming they'll pay back ""spreading the wealth"" by voting for Democrats).
                
                

            
                5. GOVERNMENT

 Hardon the need for growth in new businesses, jobs and investments.
                
                

            
                 
 Softon a willingness to cut taxes on capital gains, corporations and personal income, which would bring that growth, plus produce higher government revenues.
                
                

            
                7. BLAME

Chris Dodd, whose policies caused irresponsible lending and speculation, set off a debt bomb, caused a credit crunch, led to home foreclosures and finally an economic implosion.
                
                

            
                8. ETHICS

 Hardon attempts to use the tax code and government regulation to limit the use of carbon energy (one plan to tax oil, coal and natural gas use would cause the largest tax hike in American history).

 Softon reducing Big Government's waste, abuse and mismanagement in areas such as special interest/pork spending and entitlements, while putting more people on government payrolls (or the dole).
                
                

            
                12. DISCLOSURE

                15. IDEOLOGY                
                

            
                 
 Hardon warnings about ""right wing extremism,"" suggesting that this includes opponents of abortion, illegal immigration, gay marriage and some returning military veterans.
                
                

            
                 
 Softon worry about ""left wing extremism.""
                
                

            
                16. POLITICS

 Softon allowing Republicans in Congress access during the shaping of legislation.
                
                

            
                17. CHANGE                
                

            
                 
 Hardon insisting that all of Obama's sweeping reforms must be passed quickly.
                
                

            
                 
 Softon forecasts of the economic consequences of those reforms on future generations (aka ""inter-generational theft"").
                
                

            
                18. AMERICA'S IMAGE                
                

            
                 
 Hardon apologizing for America's actions (emphasizing guilt, regret and other forms of hand-wringing).
                
                

            
                 
 Softon disparaging America's detractors (who seem to forget that the USA, while not perfect, has liberated and lifted up more people than any other country in the history of the world).
                
                

            
                But every test eventually gets graded and when it comes to our president cataclysmic events may also hasten the report card. In any case, by Election Day 2010 we'll get an update on whether voters believe ""the body of work"" of President Obama and his administration is properly moving our country to where it should be hard and where it should be soft.

Obama One Year Later -- He's Just Not That Into You,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                It’s a year since Barack Obama’s election and an intriguing question is what have we learned and what has he learned?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The answer is the same in both cases. Sadly, it’s still all about him even while he pretends that it’s all about us. The phenomenon of Barack Obama—the appeal that helped elect him and the charisma he still generates, although with much less heat these days—stems from his audacity, his hope and his promise of change.                
                

            
                Last fall, it was sold as “change we can believe in.” But let’s not kid ourselves. Even a year ago he just wasn’t that into you or me. His star quality derived not from “Yes, we can!” It came from “Yes, I can!”                
                

            
                Obama’s brilliance as a candidate was that he made a sufficient number of people believe that despite his lack of experience, despite the little we knew of him as an individual (some of it troubling, including his longtime associations with radical figures), he had the glow about him of a winner. It was the glow of FDR, JFK and even, some said, of Ronald Reagan. It was all about him.                
                

            
                But as with all unrealistically inflated expectations this one—The One—has bumped into inconvenient truths. The same depressed economy that lifted Obama’s boat is causing it to sink.                 
                

            
                But because he is so much into himself and just not that into you, Obama persists in obsessing about a government-run health care program rather than focusing on the one form of change most Americans want now: jobs and economic development.                
                

            
                These times call for a leader who is more of a “hedgehog” than a “fox.” The hedgehog, described by historian and philosopher Isaiah Berlin, knows one big thing and concentrates on it. The fox knows many things and craftily plots about them.                
                

            
                A major reason that the air is going out of the Obama balloon is that his priorities are those of a fox and ours are those of a hedgehog. This disparity is lowering him in our regard. Obama is determined to remake one-sixth of our economy—health care—into a government-run program while we worry more about the other five-sixths of the economy. “It’s the economy, Mr. President.” And if you were more into us rather than you, you’d make jobs your number one job (instead of health care reform).                
                

            
                He is also dashing around, like a fox, chasing policy rabbits such as climate change. Mr. President, we can argue about global warming later. Let’s achieve economic warming first. “Green jobs” sound great. But how about some rust-colored ones in America’s Rust Belt? How about some red, white and blue jobs all across the rest of the country?                
                

            
                And, Mr. President, we appreciate your sensitivity to your critics. But that’s all about you. How about us? Did we mention jobs and the economy, Mr. Obama?                
                

            
                On that subject, with all due respect, please be humble enough to concede that while you are intelligent, the brilliance of America isn’t in its government, filled with technocrats and bureaucrats. It has been (and remains) in its people, especially those who are bold. Not the boldness of politicians like you; but the boldness of entrepreneurs and risk takers, of job creators and new business developers. Unfortunately, under your influence, the largest growth area for jobs is in government—not in the private sector. Government can serve. But it is people outside government who do the major creation and innovation in society, especially when it comes to the economy and jobs.                
                

            
                A year after your election, it is time for you to stop blaming your predecessor, George W. Bush, for the economy, the war in Afghanistan, public and political incivility and everything else you say you have to “mop up.” Put away the mop, Mr. President. Pick up a broom. Let’s have a clean sweep to a new model: our agenda, not yours.                
                

            
                If you really want us to be more into you, just get more into us.

                Politico provides a list of the attendees at the Blair House Summit. We see 38 names of Senators and Members of Congress, and yet only two of them are doctors: Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                So far, we have heard President Barack Obama, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pelosi, who just quoted an American asking, ""When is something going to happen on health care? We can't hold out much longer.""                
                

            
                But again, we might ask: What does it mean, ""something is going to happen on health care?"" What is the essence of health care? Is it having health insurance, or is it getting treated and cured? As I've have noted, you don't go to the doctor to show off your health insurance card, you go to get better.                
                

            
                Pelosi also just said, ""Health care reform is entitlement reform."" Oh, so it's not about health, it's about savings. No wonder the American people are turning off.                
                

            
                And then she added, ""I want to talk about it what it means to the economy."" But no mention of the jobs created by health care, to say nothing of medical research and medical technology.                
                

            
                And she cites the ""job lock"" because a child is sick. Well, ""job lock"" is a problem. But what if the child were not sick in the first place?                
                

            
                But of course, if we're going to think our way out of medical problems, we can't rely just on politicians. We need scientists, such as Dr. Jonas Salk, or Dr. Anthony Fauci, or Dr. Francis Collins. That's how to bend the curve.

Obama Needs A Pro-Growth Care Package,"When President Obama decided to make health-care reform his number one domestic priority, he did so knowing that one critical element of this decades-long debate has changed; namely that we are in the midst of the worst economic recession and job market since the Great Depression.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Unfortunately, the critical issues of health-care R&D, job creation and the need for pro-growth strategies as a prerequisite to generating revenue, combating rising sector inflation and contributing to America's economic recovery have largely gone unaddressed. Instead, the administration's focus is on what role, if any, the federal government should play in insuring Americans without coverage. House Democrats introduced legislation with an unprecedented $1.5 trillion price tag last week including a ""public option"" to compete with private plans, paid for by taxing wealthy Americans and imposing penalties on small businesses with payrolls of $250,000 or higher that don't provide health insurance to their employees.                
                

            
                Douglas Elmendorf, director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, said about draft legislation, ""We do not see the sort of fundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount. And on the contrary, the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility for health care costs.""                
                

            
                When combined with crippling job forecasts, the stakes couldn't be higher. Without a bi-partisan compromise, he risks a political and economic catastrophe that will threaten his larger domestic agenda and drive away the very investment communities that fund life-saving innovations and treatments.                 
                

            
                President Obama needs to bring all sides together by prioritizing three equally important objectives:                
                

            
                First, making economic growth the centerpiece of a bi-partisan reform package. Unfortunately, Democrats are giving the impression that quantity supersedes quality. By contrast, they could score points on the economy, alleviate growing fears over ""government-run health care"" and help solidify a bi-partisan compromise by tabling the radioactive options - higher taxes, cuts to Medicare, etc. - that will only exacerbate our nation's already precarious economic situation. As President Obama made clear in his speech earlier this year to the American Medical Association, ""this is a test of whether we - Democrats and Republicans alike - are serious about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal discipline.""                
                

            
                Second, encouraging private capital investment that will not only drive growth, but help cut costs, restore fiscal discipline and fight chronic diseases. Representative Rangel's (D-New York) idea of increasing taxes during a period of economic softness is a job-killing strategy; instead, we need incentives that give businesses the confidence necessary to both create jobs and invest in next-generation drugs.                
                

            
                Case in point is the debate over establishing an approval pathway for follow-on biologics, the generic version of drugs developed biologically. Policymakers remain divided over the period of data exclusivity during which a follow-on patent applicant could not rely on the innovator's data for approval. The White House, now at odds with Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), favors a seven-year period. Kennedy recently helped push through a 12-year exclusivity period in the Senate Health Committee, consistent with what many economists believe is not only the minimum necessary to help innovators capture a sufficient return, but will encourage long-term investment in a sector that contributed $88.5 billion to the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006 alone. A seven-year time period, economists contend, will only dry up investment at a time when it is badly needed.                
                

            
                Third, proposing new policies that take the focus off of public vs. private and prioritize small businesses. The notion of giving small business owners a much-needed payroll tax holiday and providing other meaningful incentives to help them achieve the ultimate goal of covering more Americans has surprisingly taken a backseat role. So has the need to bring our nation's health-care system into the 21st Century through greater investment in information technology, arguably one of the most non-partisan and pro-growth elements of the health-care debate.                
                

            
                Even a bi-partisan idea put forth by former Senate Majority Leaders Tom Daschle, Howard Baker and Bob Dole that would create state and regional health insurance exchanges, which have the potential to give individuals and small business owners greater purchasing power, has been pushed to the back of the shelf.                
                

            
                ""If you want to stop this thing dead in its tracks, or dead on arrival, in my view you put the public plan in it,"" Dole said in announcing the idea.                
                

            
                We shouldn't have to make a Hobson's choice. While Congress may decide to raise taxes to increase the number of insured Americans, without a pro-growth agreement it will ultimately fail all of our citizens by further adding to our nation's unemployment woes and eroding the high quality of medical care necessary to ensure that we create jobs and remain competitive in the global marketplace. Stated simply, Democrats and moderate Republicans running for re-election next year cannot afford to accomplish anything less.

5 Things to Watch As We Get Closer to Health Care Reform,"The Senate Finance Committee is voting on health care today. After five months of vigorous and often acerbic debate, lawmakers in Congress are still managing to get it wrong. Not only that, they're leaving many concerns unaddressed and lots of problems unresolved. Here’s what you need to know as we watch Congress embark on a roller coaster ride that will last for weeks:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                #1. Questions Still Remain -- What About Taxes?                
                

            
                Many lawmakers remain unconvinced that most of the plans that Congress will mandate will be affordable. The Senate and the House are also at odds on how to pay for the legislation, with the Senate preferring a tax on high-value insurance policies as the primary source of revenue, and House leaders favoring a surcharge on millionaires. Democrats on the far left want to impose fines on companies that do not provide coverage to their employees and middle of the road Democrats favoring a more toned down model.                
                

            
                #2. This Is Just the Beginning                
                

            
                Keep in mind that despite the hype over today’s Finance Committee hearing, the Baucus bill is not the final product. After the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will summon both Senators Baucus and Dodd -- the author of another piece of legislation that moved through the Senate Health Committee in July -- to his office discuss options about how to reach a compromise.                
                

            
                #3. Keep Your Eye On These Lawmakers                 
                

            
                Senator Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) and liberal Republican Senator Olympia Snowe (Maine) are the two women to watch. It’s likely they will vote for the Baucus bill, and when they do it will send a message that the principles included in the bill will likely be the ones that Democrats will be forced to defend in the 2010 midterm elections to their constituents. With 13 Democrats and 10 Republicans on the committee, Baucus can only afford to lose one member of his party if Republicans vote to block his bill.                
                

            
                #4. Speaker Pelosi's Role                
                

            
                Typically the House votes first on legislation and then sends a bill to the Senate. But this time it was different. The House needed to go second because it was unlikely that House moderates and Blue Dog Democrats would cast their vote on controversial legislation that might never make it through the Senate, let alone become law.                
                

            
                There’s no question Speaker Nancy Pelosi wanted to go first. Her liberal penchant is for the House to lead (in other words, for her to lead the charge) and set the marker by which every piece of policy is judged going forward. But the legislative reality was different. The Speaker simply didn’t have the votes. And she decided early on in the health care fight to cut the vote pool in half by making this a partisan bill, winnable only with Democratic votes (we knew that was the endgame at the beginning, but she sure went there quickly).                
                

            
                She still believes this is a ""message win"" for her party. That’s why she’s gone gangbusters. Watch her misstep on the public option since she’s so blind to public opinion on this point in particular.                
                

            
                #5. Plenty of Doubts Persist                
                

            
                Despite a public outcry for smart health care reform and less government control, the bill in consideration still reflects a move to give the government more control of one sixth of our economy and our health care decisions, along with original concerns like ballooning costs, mandates and subsidies. And guess what else awaits? Every bill put forth on health care would result in higher taxes.                
                

            
                While there is a manufactured sense of extreme urgency to get something done, it’s crucial that our lawmakers in both houses get it done correctly. Keep in mind that even if the Baucus bill passes the Finance Committee today, the fight is far from over, and Congress is still far from getting it right.

Yet Another Health Care Capitulation,"Today, advocates of true health care reform were disappointed to learn that the Kucinich amendment was removed from the latest version of the health care reform bill. At the end of the day, states may be given the option to opt out, but won’t be allowed to opt into a proven system that provides all of a state’s residents with better health care.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Many states are demanding single payer. Not only does it help people stay out of poverty and provide health care for all, but it would provide major relief for states facing budget difficulties. The Lewin Group’s financial analysis of the California single payer bill that passed the legislature twice found that “the net cost of the program to state and local governments is a savings of about $900 million” in 2006 alone. There are also strong single payer movements in Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois, Colorado, and New Mexico.                
                

            
                If a state wants better health care than can be provided by the federal government in the health care bill we are seeing today, the federal government should not stand in their way. The removal of the Kucinich amendment constitutes yet another capitulation to the health insurance and pharmaceutical industries who are already reaping billions of dollars from the bill.

The People Spoke on Saturday,"Before the start of Saturday’s March on Washington, organizers said they expected between 50 and 100 thousand people to attend. As anyone looking at the photographs of the actual event can see, their prediction was way, way off.

                The people who turned out came in groups on busses they had chartered on their own dime. They flew in from all over the country. One father and his college-age daughter drove in from southern Indiana -- it took them about ten hours – just to be part of the ""mob"" on the Mall. The 9.12 rally was a genuine expression of a very real political sentiment: that they’re not buying what Obama and the Democrats in Congress are selling. And not just on health care.                
                

            
                *There were coal miners and their families who say their jobs will go up in smoke if the “cap-and-trade” energy tax makes it through Congress.
*There were folks whose livelihoods have already been taken from them, like the auto dealer whose franchise agreement Washington voided as part of the government’s restructuring of Chrysler and General Motors.
*There were people carrying signs that showed they were worried about the corruption and potential for corruption on Capitol Hill and in the executive branch, including the proliferation of constitutionally questionable and congressionally unaccountable policy-making “czars” inside the White House.
*And, tying it all together, there were concerns expressed by many about how the president and and the Congress are spending the people’s money at previously unheard of rates, the growing national debt and how, for the first time in history, its size is fast approaching the total U.S. gross domestic product or GDP.                
                

            
                It’s easy to dismiss the crowd as the product of “AstroTurf” lobbying -- the kind of activity national organizations stage to make it appear that an issue has captured more attention out in America’s heartland than it actually has. It would be easy -- and it would be wrong.                
                

            
                Nonetheless that appears to be exactly what President Obama and the Democrats in Congress seem ready to do. Rather than work to develop a truly bipartisan approach to the problems facing America, one where all parties have meaningful input, the president has adopted, at least as far as health care reform is concerned, the “my way or the highway” approach.                
                

            
                Pretending to seek the support of Republicans and promising to develop a bill that takes ideas from all corners, despite the fact that some of them violate Obama campaign promises, senior White House aides like David Axelrod and Rahm Emmanuel are telegraphing the administration’s willingness to jam major changes to the U.S. health care system down everyone’s throat on party lines using a parliamentary device known as reconciliation.                
                

            
                To Axelrod and Emmanuel and others of their kind, the bipartisan approach consists of pushing the Republicans in Congress toward the edge of a cliff until they agree to do what the White House wants. It may be interesting politics but it’s not the best way to make policy. They refuse to acknowledge, as the marchers made plain, that while America may indeed want some kind of health care reform and a host of other issues, they don’t want the reforms Obama and the Democrats are offering.

                Here are really big questions for the big presidential debate on domestic policy on October 3rd in Denver.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Let’s begin with three humongous questions for President Obama. That will be followed by three terrifyingly large questions for the challenger Gov. Mitt Romney. Here we go:                
                

            
                1. President Obama, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has given you an “F.” They say the failure is based on your “lack of leadership” the gun control issue.  In your first term, we have had three of the worst mass shootings in US History, (Tucson, Arizona, Aurora Colorado, and Oak Creek, Wisconsin) Could you have done more to stop the spread of assault weapons and gun violence over the last four years?
 
 Will you make gun control a priority in your second term? Are you paralyzed by the National Rifle Association’s political clout?
 
 2. President Obama during the debate over health care reform you said that a “Public Option” -- where the government can compete with private companies to offer low-cost health insurance “should be part of reform.”  A CBS/New York Times poll from earlier this year found that 27 percent of Americans feel your health care reform “did not go far enough.” We already have a form of the “Public Option” for seniors in Medicare. The Veterans’ Administration health program is also a government run option.
 
 Why didn’t you push harder for a “Public Option” for all Americans in your health care reform? Is this something you plan to revisit in your second term?                
                

            
                3. Here is one final question for you, Mr. President. In 2008, you campaigned on a promise to close the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Four years later, the facility is still open. Dozens of suspected terrorists are still being held there. And some intelligence reports suggest that an inmate released from Guantanamo in 2007 may be involved with the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya last month.                
                

            
                Are you prepared to now admit that the prison at Guantanamo Bay is too important a tool in the War on Terror to be closed?                   
                

            
                Now that President Obama has been left dazed by those big questions, here are three monumental inquiries for Romney.                
                

            
                1. Gov. Romney you have promised to reduce the deficit and cut the size of government. That’s great. But you refuse to say how you plan to do that without throwing the economy back into recession. Can you tell us tonight which federal programs you will eliminate right away; which tax deductions and subsidies you plan to eliminate?                
                

            
                2. Gov. Romney, if elected President under what circumstances will you keep US troops in Afghanistan after the end of this year? You are on record as agreeing with President Obama’s timetable for withdrawal by the end of 2014? So, how does your Afghanistan policy differ in any way from President Obama’s unless you secretly believe there might be good reasons for keeping American forces there?                
                

            
                3. Gov. Romney, Israel is America’s top ally in the Middle East. So, do you think American policy in the Middle East should always be based on Israeli concerns and demands? Or should U.S. interest in maintaining stable alliances throughout the region guide U.S. policy in the region?                
                

            
                Don’t leave yet.  Here are two bonus round question for you, governor.                
                

            
                You caused a lot of heartburn among conservatives this summer when you said there are parts of President Obama’s Health Care Reform law that you like and that you would keep in place.                
                

            
                You specifically pointed to two central tenets of the plan: First, requiring that insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions. And second allowing children to stay on their parent’s health plans until they are 26. Please tell us now what are the other parts of the president’s new health care law that you would keep in place?
 
 And one more for you, governor: You have repeatedly accused the People’s Republic of China from manipulating its currency and violating U.S. Copyright and Patent Law. You fault President Obama for not being aggressive in stopping China from practicing unfair trade. Realistically, how will you get China to change its policies? Would you be willing to risk damaging the U.S. economy with a trade war with China?
 
 Gentlemen, please pick your jaws up off the floor. We’ll let you know how you did with these questions on Election Day.

              President Trump caused some head scratching when he told a plane full of journalists en route to France that “what I’d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan.” But as the Russia investigations drag on, the prospects for health care reform are on hold, and tax reform continues to be a work in progress, this seemingly far-fetched plan may in fact be the most likely opportunity for the president to land a signature legislative victory during his first year in office. 
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s not the conventional bet, but this is not a conventional time nor a conventional president – and, this is not the first time we’ve seen him lay some groundwork for such a pursuit. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The travel ban and aggressive enforcement have been the face of the administration’s immigration policy thus far, but the facts on the ground have changed of late. The president just announced the number of illegal border crossings has dropped by 75 percent since his inauguration.  This may create the opportunity to do more.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Getting to yes on immigration would be a legacy-making move for President Trump – his Nixon-goes-to-China moment.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
               Even before his comments on Air Force One, President Trump had signaled a desire and willingness to go beyond enforcement to fix the broken visa system and address the fact that 11 million people live here without legal status. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A couple weeks ago he told Apple CEO Tim Cook and a gathering of tech leaders that he would put “more heart”into the immigration debate and pledged to work on comprehensive immigration reform, a sentiment he had expressed a couple months earlier to a room full of broadcast journalists. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These comments may be far from setting administration policy – indeed, Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly just indicated he may not defend Obama-era protection for DREAMers and Politico is reporting that some in the Trump Administration are advocating for cutting legal immigration in half – but they do make clear that a broad immigration overhaul is on the president’s mind and he is open to taking on the issue that has stymied every president since Reagan.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              I’ll be the first to acknowledge reasonable skepticism, but working on this issue from a nonpartisan vantage point, I believe there are three compelling reasons to believe immigration reform is and should be at the top of the agenda:
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              First, this is how President Trump can fulfill his promises on immigration enforcement. On its own, a bill to build a wall is dead on arrival in the Senate. However, in 2013, a comprehensive bill passed the Senate with votes from 54 Democrats and 14 Republicans. And it passed because instead of focusing solely on enforcement, it overhauled our outdated legal immigration system.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
               The bill didn’t skimp on the border, either. It included $46 billion for security and enforcement, double what President Trump is requesting for his wall now. It mandated hundreds of miles of walls and fences, doubled the number of border patrol agents, and funded aircraft, watchtowers, ground sensors, and mobile surveillance to further monitor the border, while also cracking down on employers who hired undocumented immigrants.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Second, and in contrast to many of the administration’s other legislative priorities, overhauling the immigration system already enjoys major bipartisan support in this Congress. Since the 2013 bill, new Republican supporters like Senator Thom Tillis have joined longtime Republican stalwarts like Senators Flake and Hatch in calling for broad immigration reform. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In this Congress, Republicans in both chambers have already introduced four distinct bills that would provide undocumented immigrants with legal status. (One such bill in the House has attracted more than 200 co-sponsors, including 99 Republicans.)
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Finally, despite all the political rhetoric, immigration is actually one of the least controversial policy issues out there.  Americans don’t want open borders and amnesty, but they also don’t want to deport 11 million people, the vast majority of whom are not criminals, are working, and are active members of their communities. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Multiple polls show that Americans of all political persuasions, including a clear majority of Trump voters, overwhelmingly support immigration reform that would secure the border, grant legal status to non-criminal undocumented immigrants, and bring the visa system into the 21st century by increasing protections for American workers while also allowing companies to recruit the top talent and necessary workers to fill gaps in the American workforce.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
               Importantly, popular support for these policies is only growing – but to enact them, we’ll need a dealmaker who can succeed where so many others have failed. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To get a deal, President Trump needs to sweeten the pot by adding broadly popular reforms that would grow the American economy. According to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, such comprehensive reform would cut the deficit by $900 billion over 20 years because of tax revenues from the millions of people who would be able to formally enter the workforce, and would actually result in a 0.5 percent wage increase for all American workers. It would go a long way toward supporting the administration’s economic growth and job creation goals – the president’s own chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has written extensively on the large gains immigration reform can bring – while also creating the budget room for other major priorities. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Of course, the loudest voices might insist on an enforcement-only approach, and decry anything they suspect to be “amnesty.” But balanced against such a challenge will be the enormous political, historical, and economic upside of passing comprehensive immigration reform. Getting to yes on immigration would be a legacy-making move for President Trump – his Nixon-goes-to-China moment, one that would put his deal-making skills on a level with the last president to sign immigration reform, Ronald Reagan.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              After decades of gridlock on immigration, political necessity and popular demand seem to have aligned. Now it’s in the power of the Dealmaker in Chief to make immigration reform a reality.

                Ask students how long they can stay on their parents’ health insurance because of ObamaCare, and they will likely know the answer is until age 26.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But how about asking them when the individual mandate goes into effect, how the age rating restriction will impact premium costs, or what perverse incentives ObamaCare creates for employers to cut hours and paychecks?                
                

            
                Too many will be surprised to learn that the individual mandate penalty goes into effect on January 1.

                Too many don’t know that the Affordable Care Act limits insurers’ ability to adjust premium costs based on factors such as age.

                The ACA mandates that insurers can only charge older people as much as three times the rate charged to younger people, so insurers have less flexibility to charge lower premium costs for younger people.                 
                

            
                Too many young people haven’t yet realized that ObamaCare will shift more costs to them to pay for older, generally less healthy people.                 
                

            
                One study, for example, predicts those between the ages of 21 and 29 will be hit with a 42 percent premium cost increase under ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Similarly, young people aren’t likely to know that ObamaCare requires employers with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time workers to provide coverage or pay a penalty.                 
                

            
                Many businesses struggling in this economy have chosen to cut employees’ hours or keep the number of employees under 50.                 
                

            
                Who often suffers? Young workers and job-seekers.                
                

            
                During a recent speech on campus, I asked the crowd about some of these issues. They were indeed quick to recognize that they could stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26, but they were unaware of the increased costs they would face once they had to buy insurance for themselves.                 
                

            
                This is a problem.                
                

            
                According to research cited in a recent report from the College Republican National Committee, “Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation,” 41 percent of the young people surveyed thought the overall impact of ObamaCare would be positive, and young people preferred how Democrats handled health care by a 63-37 margin. But do they really understand what the Democrats did?                
                

            
                Republicans and other critics of ObamaCare must more effectively make the negative impact of the law known to young people and do so in a compelling way.                
                

            
                This month, the Republican National Committee launched ObamaCareCosts.org, a website dedicated to showing the costs of ObamaCare.                 
                

            
                One video begins with the president touting the positive aspects of his reform effort and ends with a woman challenging his claims by complaining about the costs she faces. The website includes media clips, polls, and an interactive tool that visitors can use to find articles on the negative impact of ObamaCare in their local communities by entering their zip codes.                
                

            
                This puts the effects of this reckless legislation into human terms, and it’s a good demonstration of the real impact the law will have on people. We need more of this.                
                

            
                In 2010, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it….” It has been over three years since ObamaCare was signed into law, but too many people -- especially young people -- still don’t know what’s really in it.                 
                

            
                The administration knows it is important to win over young people.                 
                

            
                This summer, for example, Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the president, convened a meeting of celebrities to recruit them to sell the ACA, which included actor Kal Penn (a former Obama administration official), comedian Amy Poehler, Funny or Die’s Mike Farah and YouTube’s Daniel Kellison, among others.                
                

            
                If critics of ObamaCare want to undo the damage of this legislation and pursue health care reform, they must make an even greater effort to make the true costs and consequences of ObamaCare apparent to young people.                 
                

            
                Young people must know more about ObamaCare than “Age 26.”

Who Is Blocking Health Care Reform Now?,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Could President Obama be obstructing health care reform? Is it possible? I never imagined writing these words. Yet, after watching the president deliver his State of the Union address on Wednesday night, this question lingered in my mind. Driven by ideology, could President Obama now be the one obstructing real patient-centered health care reform?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Without question health care reform lay at the center of the president’s domestic agenda. But with the election of Senator Scott Brown, he no longer has the votes needed to push universal health care reform through the Senate. Driven by pork, pay-offs, and dirty backroom deals the public has lost trust in Washington and their plan for government-run health care. Last week’s Rasmussen poll revealed that 58% of Americans—a record high—now oppose his plan. At this point, it looks like even getting health care legislation through the House is an uphill climb.                
                

            
                Yet, President Obama remains determined to press on with his full agenda. He firmly believes in the expansion of government to care its citizens. On Wednesday night we saw no course correction. There was no change in tone or willingness to compromise on simper measures. There was no acknowledgement that independent voters have swung heavily toward less government and more fiscal responsibility. It seemed as if the president had missed the Massachusetts Senate race—and its implications—altogether.                
                

            
                This raises the question, if President Obama is unable to pass comprehensive health care reform, will he keep smaller, separate measures (such as letting businesses purchase insurance across state lines or ending frivolous litigation) off the table?                
                

            
                Fixing Complex Systems                
                

            
                Americans understand our health care system still needs serious reform. Twenty-five percent of the patients in my emergency room do not have coverage. The skyrocketing cost of health care now consumes 17% of our GDP. These concerns clearly need to be addressed.
However, Americans also understand that fixing a system as complex as American healthcare must be done in small, well defined, fiscally responsible steps. This is where President Obama’s health care reform efforts went seriously wrong.                
                

            
                The president and Congress attempted to revamp the entire system with a single, 2,000+ page bill, the bulk of which was put together behind closed doors. Even more worrisome, the overt “pay-to-play” deals with Senator Landrieu (D, La.) and Ben Nelson (D, Neb.) permanently tarnished the public’s perception of the legislative process. If the bill was so bad that Senators required bribes for their vote, the public understandably lost confidence in both the policy and in the process.                
                

            
                Seizing the Mantel                
                

            
                On Wednesday night President Obama offered an open invitation: “But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.” Plans that use free-market solutions to cut health care costs, stimulate the economy, and increase jobs already exist. I briefly outlined such a plan last week in the Fox Forum piece earlier this month: “Five Health Care Solutions that Make Sense.”                 
                

            
                With competing plans on the table, whoever most clearly outlines a series of common sense, step-wise reforms will own the issue of health care for decades to come. The political stakes could not be higher given the winner takes all nature of the debate.                
                

            
                For example, President Obama never explained how he could cut $500 billion from the program without compromising care for seniors. This is of particular concern for seniors given that a Mayo Clinic in Arizona just closed its doors to Medicare patients due to government underpayment. This highly emotional issue could shift the entire senior citizen demographic.                
                

            
                Free-market, patient-centered solutions run counter to President Obama’s understanding of effective “health care reform.” However, the primary difficulty for these ideas is they threaten the Democratic power base. We saw this in the recent Massachusetts election when independent voters elected a Republican in a deep blue state. Given this, the question becomes, if the We the People choose step-wise, patient-centered, fiscally responsible reforms, will President Obama stand in the way?

What President-elect Trump should do now: Ten suggestions,"FILE -- 
	                        
	                        	 (AP Photo/Richard Drew )
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                For nearly seventeen months now, I presumed that Donald Trump was playing an elaborate game of chicken with the American people.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Sure, Trump was running for president. But there’s no way it would last until Election Day. The moment another Republican embraced the border wall, or Trump tired of the candidates’ debates, or voters tired of Trump, he’d quit the race and return to business as usual: developing real estate and fostering his cult of personality.                
                

            
                But Trump kept going – through the primaries, then the general election, to a stunning Election Night upset that earns him a four-year stay in a white, albeit less ornate mansion that’s a short stroll from the fancier hotel he recently opened in the nation’s capital.                
                

            
                Now Donald Trump will be the nation’s 45th President.                
                

            
                Repeat, exhale . . . then say it again.                
                

            
                Donald Trump will be the nation’s 45th President.                
                

            
                The trick now: solving the Bill McKay question. That’s the fictional politician Robert Redford played in the 1972 movie “The Candidate,” which ends with the senator-elect asking: “What do we now?”.                
                

            
                Here are 10 suggestions for President-Elect Trump.                
                

            
                1. Seize the Moment. I was going to start this by suggesting Trump spend a week in Palm Beach seclusion for some much-needed R&R. That can wait until Thanksgiving and beyond, when it’s time for the big transition decisions that can be done behind the scenes.                
                

            
                If I were Trump, I’d travel back to the unlikeliest states that delivered for him on Election Day and hold large rallies – both to thank the voters and explain the greater mission ahead to change Washington’s culture. I’d add in a couple of rallies in states that didn’t vote for him, just to underscore that he wants to be a president for the entire people.                
                

            
                Trump should invite Hillary Clinton for a private lunch. He should also let it be known that he wants to sit down with President Obama and discuss an amicable transition.                
                

            
                2. Read Up on Andrew Jackson. This was only the second time in the history of the nation that an election was held at the end of three consecutive two-term presidencies.                
                

            
                In 1824, it was John Quincy Adams staving off a populist challenge from Andrew Jackson, the man who statue sits in Lafayette Park, across the street from the North Portico of the White House.                
                

            
                That race was bitter and ended with talk of a rigged system (a “corrupt bargain” between Adams and House Speaker Henry Clay). Four years later, Jackson rode the revolution into Washington, the tip of the spear of voter resentment against a political class that had dominated the first 50 years of the republic.                
                

            
                This could have been the scenario in 2020. Much to everyone’s surprise, the revolution came four years ahead of schedule, with the unlikeliest of generals leading the charge.                
                

            
                I don’t know if Trump is one for history, but someone in his world should introduce the man to Jackson and the roots of American populism. After all, it’s now Trump who gets to write the next chapter.                
                

            
                3. Time to Let Go. Assuming Trump is able to be a gracious winner (and his speech Wednesday night was a good start), it’s time to pivot out of campaign mode. He’s now tasked with acting as a statesman, not a showman treating presidential political like a reality TV show.                
                

            
                It’s time to bid adieu to “Crooked Hillary” and “Lying Ted” and the “corrupt media”.                
                

            
                For Trump to have any semblance of dignified leadership, he has to let go of the petty insults and juvenile denigrations that are simply unbecoming of a president.                
                

            
                That includes the dead-of-the-night tweeting.  Yes, I’d let the incoming president hold on his Smartphone – so long as he limits it to crowd selfies.                
                

            
                4. Meet With GOP Thought Leaders. Can Trump work with a Republican Congress? Some members will be on board right away; for others, it will take time (hint: handing out presidential goodies has a way of healing wounds).                
                

            
                The more immediate concern for Trump would be getting Republican thought leaders on board – the commentary class whose support will come in handy when it’s time to rally the party behind a first-term agenda.                
                

            
                There’s nothing stopping Trump from holding a series of dinner salons with influential conservatives in New York (The Wall Street Journal editorial board, for example) and in the District of Columbia (Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, George Will, to name just a few).                
                

            
                Presidents tend to do this at the end of their presidency – courting historians in an attempt to spin their first draft of history. Trump needs the ideas merchants sooner than he may realize.                
                

            
                5. Put Someone in The West Wing Who’ll Challenge You. Throughout the saga that was the Trump campaign, there was always the question of adult supervision: an aide, a confidante who could tell Trump things he didn’t want to hear and convince him to moderate bad habits.                
                

            
                Kellyanne Conway came closest to achieving disciplinary influence over Trump. At best, she’ll divide her time between Washington and her home in northern New Jersey.                
                

            
                This is a job for the new chief of staff. Who has the stature to pull this off? New Gingrich? Rudy Giuliani? Would either be willing to be the West Wing’s bad cop, confronting Trump when they think he’s wrong on policy, strategy or execution?                
                

            
                This is a time when it pays to have wise counsel from a long-time Washington insider. We’ll see if Trump lets anyone of that ilk inside the tent.                
                

            
                6. Build a Cabinet of Insiders and Outsiders. Are we in store for talk of another “Team Of Rivals” approach to building a presidential cabinet (in reality, the gang Barack Obama assembled wasn’t all that Lincoln-esque).                
                

            
                Trump could import some rivals from the GOP primaries – Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee tuned out to be loyal surrogates. And there’s the deep bench on Republicans in Congress and in running states nationwide. What Trump does about Chris Christie – leading the transition effort, perhaps coveting the Attorney General slot, but tainted by last week’s “Bridgegate” convictions – will be interesting to watch.                
                

            
                A reminder for Trump: in addition to promising to drain the Washington, D.C. swamp, he began the campaign vowing to bring a business sensibility to the federal government. If he doesn’t sprinkle his cabinet with secretaries possessing a private sector, outsiders’ perspective, then the president-elect has broken his first pledge.                
                

            
                7. Reboot Press Relations. If you think the Chief of Staff will have it tough, try being the new White House Secretary.                
                

            
                Most new administrations get a period of grace before the press starts turning the screws. Not Trump – certainly not after months of demonizing his press entourage.                
                

            
                Trump won’t receive the same fan-boy coverage that characterized Obama’s first year on the job. At best, he plays for a draw by being more transparent than his predecessor (not a high bar to clear).                   
                

            
                Just as stressful for the press secretary will be dealing with the new president when there’s bad press – that’s not an if, but a when. We know Trump can be overly sensitive to negative coverage. If he’s smart, he resists the urge to storm into the Briefing Room and tell the press corps what’s on his mind.                
                

            
                8. Deliver a Humble Inaugural. It took Ronald Reagan 2,427 words to deliver a moving inaugural in 1981. JFK did his in 1,366 words. Abraham Lincoln, in 1865, was even terser: a mere 700 words.                
                

            
                For Trump, this first big speech is more than the opening act of his presidency. It’s about making a good first impression with a skeptical public. He foes that by demonstrating the enormity of the vow he will have just taken.                
                

            
                Trump has an advantage here: a bench of talented speechwriters from the past three Republican presidencies who may be willing to help with the historical (my Hoover Institution colleague Peter Robinson, author of Reagan’s “Tear Down This Wall” speech, would be a good place to start).                
                

            
                Trump should task a team to study how past presidents approached their first address, pair it with some solid polling and focus groups, and keep the rhetoric to a minimum and the style muted. If so, Trump just might get off to a good start.                
                

            
                9. Strike Fast with the Stroke of a Pen. For all the talk of what he can pull off with a Republican Congress, consider what Trump can do on his own, thanks to the use of executive orders.                
                

            
                Here is a list of 13 things Trump could do in his first day on the job:                  
                

            
                Cancelling the Paris climate accord, scrapping energy regulations, approving the Keystone pipeline, reversing coal leasing moratoriums on federal lands.                
                

            
                And maybe the biggest blow of all: he could kill the Iran nuclear deal.                
                

            
                10. Offer a Pragmatic Agenda. Those three consecutive two-term presidencies were marked by consistency and comity, the final stretch of the run dubbed the “Era of Good Feelings”.                
                

            
                Bill Clinton and Barack Obama almost didn’t get that second term because they bit off more than they could chew once they took office. For each, a big reach on health care reform would have devastating consequences I midterm elections.                
                

            
                Trump doesn’t lack for bold, provocative ideas – most notably, building that wall along the southern border. But can he do that, tax reform, and set a new course on defense spending and national security, not to mention repealing and replacing ObamaCare? Of course not.                
                

            
                So where should Trump start? I’d choose tax reform. There’s arguably more bipartisan consensus on that than anything else he’s proposed. And the promise of new revenue will help justify any extra dough Trump wants to spend on a Pentagon buildup or an infrastructure blueprint.                
                

            
                Can Trump succeed at all of the above? It helps that the media will usher him into office with brutally low expectations. If he gets to work, takes the job seriously and begins to make headway in a horribly divided town, that bar has nowhere to go but up.

OK. Interesting, but no revelations.
Fair. Checked out the beginning, but now it’s just politics as usual.

"Hey, GOP Candidates -- Bring Your 'A' Game to the Iowa Debate or Stay Home","Like many Americans across the country, I will be watching Thursday’s Iowa presidential debates with keen interest.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Watch the GOP debate on Fox News Channel at 9 p.m. ET or watch it streaming live on FoxNews.com from 8:30 p.m. ET.                
                

            
                There is no doubt this debate will make or break the campaigns of one or two candidates. So, if the candidates have been holding anything back, now is the time to bring it. The Iowa Caucuses are only 20 days away, followed shortly by New Hampshire.                
                

            
                As the newest frontrunner, Newt Gingrich is facing criticism for blemishes on his very long political record. His opponents will seek to exploit his past support for an individual health care mandate, bailouts, and climate change. And to be fair, Americans deserve to know how Gingrich has changed, not only on these policy issues, but on past personal and moral choices.                
                

            
                It’s no secret Gingrich is receiving disapproval, especially from evangelical Christians, for his three marriages. But as Christians, we desperately desire forgiveness and grace, and we believe it exists for all who ask for it from God, even our leaders.                 
                

            
                The real angst centers on the question of true repentance, which is essential for change but, alas, only God sees our hearts. And we have to give Gingrich credit for going above and beyond this week to confront his past personal and public woes.                
                

            
                I was impressed when last week Gingrich drafted his own marriage pledge, which committed his loyalty to his wife, conservative values, the Constitution, and the American people, in response to the Family Leaders’ “Marriage Vow.” -- Yes, we want it in writing.                
                

            
                Besides moral character, America’s current economic crisis is, and will continue to be, the greatest factor in the 2012 election.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney has the best professional background in business and has been a steady candidate throughout the race, although Gingrich and Perry cleaned his clock in last week’s debate. But despite his experience, Romney’s big-government views will likely frustrate voters who are tired of the country’s huge unemployment rates and a mounting $15 trillion national debt. Further, it will be hard for the former Massachusetts governor to explain why his state health care reform cost the state $4.3 billion, sacrificed over 18,000 jobs, and did not include protection for the unborn. Yes, we know Romney blames the state courts, but in the end, he signed the law.                
                

            
                Rick Perry did much better in the last debate and, by now, the campaign has acknowledged that he had serious back surgery that many believe severely impacted his performance early in his campaign. His exceptional record as governor of Texas, and his dedication to his evangelical faith, gains him support from Iowa Christian conservatives, but is it enough? Perry’s super PAC, Make Us Great Again, has spent over $2 million on campaign ads in Iowa alone. As a result, his poll numbers may be improving.                 
                

            
                This debate may truly make or break him. If he does well, he may have a chance to resurge; if not, he should probably pack it up and think about future career opportunities.                
                

            
                Michele Bachmann did a great job in the last debate explaining more of her personal background and how it shapes her strong Constitutional principles. I had no idea her father deserted her and left her  Godly, single mother to raise the family.                 
                

            
                It is also essential for Michele to hit a home run this time around, but if it is anything like last week, she is up to the task. The congresswoman used her consistent conservative record to decimate Newt and Romney, and she will be a fierce threat to them again on Thursday.                
                

            
                And why on earth has Rick Santorum’s passionate social and fiscal platforms not gained more support? He is the real deal. A father of seven, including a daughter named Bella who was born with Trisomy 18, a seriously disabling and usually fatal disorder, he’s got an amazing record in the Senate for carrying the pro-life and pro-family torch. It makes no sense why he has had to fight for even a shred of media attention. My advice to Santorum: master the art of knee-capping your opponents while smiling like you just offered them a cookie.                
                

            
                Ron Paul has done a great job of changing the debate over the Federal Reserve’s heavy hand in citizen’s lives, but he isn’t serious when it comes to foreign policy. Does he really not believe that Iran is a threat to national security? And where does he stand in support of Israel if, God forbid, Iran makes an attack?                
                

            
                Is Jon Huntsman in this debate? I honestly believe he made a mistake and meant to sign up for the next Democratic presidential race. Based on his social and fiscal policies, I can’t see him as the next GOP nominee. (Although, I do see him selling me my next used car when this race is over.)                
                

            
                Yes I know, ANOTHER debate. How many does this make? Fifty? Regardless, folks, this is the one to watch. Don the jammies, grab the popcorn, and figure out who should lead the free world.

A blueprint for creating better accountability from government,"(Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                I will never forget the mom who approached me at a congressional field hearing on education in Cleveland years ago.
 
 “Mr. Congressman, I need your help,” she said. “Five years ago I wanted to enroll my son in a different school because the school he was assigned to was terrible. School officials told me, ‘don’t worry, we have a five-year plan to fix the school.’ Congressman, it’s now five years later, the school is worse than it ever was, and I still can’t enroll my son in another school. Now all I hear is, ‘We have a new five-year plan.’ Mr. Congressman, if I can’t get my son into a school that works I will lose my son.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I went numb. There was nothing I could do. Nothing she could do.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                I often think of that mom and her son. She had no immediate recourse for holding a failed government school accountable.                
                

            
                Much of the public similarly believes that ""government accountability” is an oxymoron, that it just doesn’t exist.
 
 They see the long lines at TSA checkpoints, ObamaCare websites that don’t work, and economic policies that drive up unemployment. There is no simple process for citizens to demand better service from their government.
 
 Contrast that with the free market, where consumers have a say.
 
 Millions of Target’s shoppers are holding the retail giant accountable for its massive data breach. They're shopping elsewhere. Target competes daily with other big box stores on price, quality, and service, and they know that their customers have a choice.
 
 Consumers hold auto dealers accountable for bad experiences by choosing to shop elsewhere.
 
 Restaurants know that unhappy customers have choices.
 
 Choices abound in the free market. Choice creates real and immediate accountability.
 
 It is why government’s “customers” are so palpably exasperated with the government monopoly on so many products and services that impact our lives. They often have nowhere else to turn.
 
 Any customer of government – whether it’s with education, taxes, housing, or health care – understands the frustrations when they have a bad experience. They're stuck and can't go anywhere else.
 
 They also see that government does not hold itself accountable. Unacceptable performance is tolerated indefinitely. Nobody loses their job over such failures as ObamaCare websites, Benghazi, the IRS targeting certain groups for extra scrutiny, or the Justice Department spying on reporters.
 
 Citizens have only have one recourse: voting elected officials out of office. It is extremely difficult to hold lawmakers accountable – especially in the House with tightly drawn congressional districts designed to benefit incumbents – and elections are held on a predetermined schedule once every two (House members), four (presidents) and six (senators) years.
 
 It is not immediate or easy, but voters ultimately do have the final say.
 
 Short of success at the ballot box here is a simple blueprint for implementing better accountability in government.
 
 First, whenever possible, products and services should be delivered in free market environments and not by government. Consumer accountability drives quality and efficiency.
 
 Second, where it is unavoidable that government provides goods and services such as with schools and public transportation, private sector competition to government delivery systems should be facilitated.

                Health care reform is probably the best and most recent example of where less government rather than more government would have resulted in the best possible outcome.                
                

            
                Finally, when there are no alternatives to government-driven products and services, strong leadership at government’s highest levels should demand that “the public – our customer – will be served. Any failure to meet that standard, or failure to meet the highest ethical and criminal standards, will result in heads rolling.”

Obama Must Fix Health Care AND Create Jobs,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The Obama administration released their plan for health care reform this morning. It is great that the president has finally done this but the White House waited too long. It is understandable that they did not want to repeat the HillaryCare disaster of the Bill Clinton years by writing a plan that was mocked by everyone from members of Congress to “Harry and Louise.” However, given the dysfunction that we now know is rampant in Congress the president needed to be a leader in this process. Now he has finally done it. Releasing his own plan will insure that the discussion on Thursday at the health care summit has some real meat to it and is not just a rallying point for either Democrats or Republicans to keep hammering away at their well-defined positions.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Many of the president’s critics are saying that jobs should be his main focus right now and that Democrats should simple table health care reform. While that argument might make sense on the face of it, but if we do not make some changes to an area that now comprises one sixth of our economy it ruin all of us. The president has not choice but to continue his quest to solve some of the more glaring problems in our health care system. With a nationwide unemployment rate of almost 10 percent and our country’s real unemployment hovering near seventeen percent, not fixing health care will cost states more in Medicaid and also ramp up the cost to the federal government in Medicare disability. Like the old television comedy routine, when you close one drawer the other one will open unless you fix the entire cabinet. -- It can't be just jobs or health care, it has to be both.                
                

            
                The president's plan incorporates some of the Republican’s suggestions for reform and sets up a system to reduce premiums so that people can afford to purchase insurance. It allows a competitive health market so that people can get the same plan that Congress has and it will end the problem of pre-existing conditions as a barrier for people who can't purchase policies. The president's plan for health care reform claims that it will reduce the deficit by $100 billion over the next ten years. Assuming the Obama administration’s numbers are accurate, how could the president not continue to press for health care reform? It makes all the sense in the world. Jobs and health care are not mutually exclusive.

We Can't Lose Our Global Leadership In Medical Innovation,"The health care reforms President Obama recently signed into law have been put forward as the culmination of the U.S.’s moral obligation to provide health care for those who cannot afford it. Advocates of this view embrace the European vision of social insurance, or “solidarity,” in which government-financed health care is the cornerstone of a civilized society.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As a European with dual U.S. citizenship, I’m skeptical about whether European social policies truly benefit those they are intended to help. And I’m deeply concerned that America’s embrace of the European solidarity model will come at the expense of another, ultimately a more valuable brand of solidarity: solidarity with the young and with future generations, who depend on continued medical innovations. If the U.S., in the name of funding a new universal health care entitlement, abandons its global leadership in medical innovation, we’ll be selling our future short.                
                

            
                European nations have set price controls or other restrictions on new drugs, diagnostics, and medical devices that limit patient access to those technologies – and limit profits for the companies that make them. Partly due to these government controls, Europe manages to spend significantly less than the U.S. does while still maintaining fairly advanced medical systems.                
                

            
                Has Europe found some new way to have their cake and eat it too – enjoying both lower costs and high levels of innovation?                
                

            
                In a word, no. Solidarity is cheap in Europe, but only because it is expensive in the U.S. The United States generates the lion’s share of global profits for medical innovators, because so far U.S. policymakers have rejected explicit price controls on private markets. For example, more than half the world’s sales of drugs occur in the U.S., even though the U.S. represents only about one-fifth of the world economy. Profits generated in the United States allow innovators across the world to fund the expensive R&D efforts that are critical for bringing innovative new medicines to market.                
                

            
                Countries like the United Kingdom, with just 3% of world drug sales, face very different incentives. In fact, it is in their self-interest to provide solidarity through government-controlled prices, because such a policy does not significantly affect the flow of new medicines into Britain. As long as the U.S. underwrites world innovation, E.U. member countries can “free ride” on the new flow of treatments largely paid for by American free-market policies.                
                

            
                However, if the U.S. were to start acting like a European country – as seems likely in the wake of health care reform and the resulting fiscal pressures to come–innovation would lessen world-wide, reducing the flow of new and valuable products both to Americans and Europeans. The U.S. faces real innovation tradeoffs in creating new health care entitlements; European countries don’t.                
                

            
                Proponents of American reform may still claim that it merely aims to eliminate wasteful spending. However, the consensus in the research community is that new technologies are the main source of cost-growth in the U.S., but they also generate far larger health benefits than increased spending. Waste does need to be eliminated, particularly in public programs, but it is not the primary factor driving health care inflation. Put differently, insurance plans offering 1980s technologies with the corresponding lower premiums would not survive today.                
                

            
                Because of the economic value of innovation, by moving toward the European government-based model of care the U.S. faces a choice between two forms of solidarity. One is the most commonly articulated version of solidarity with those who currently cannot afford care: universal coverage. It’s all about the present and the near term. The other version is solidarity towards the younger population and future generations, who will inevitably suffer from U.S.-based reforms that reduce medical innovation. It’s about the long term. In effect, American solidarity with the less affluent today risks shortchanging the young tomorrow.                
                

            
                This does not have to be the case. Not all consumers require equal help in accessing affordable health care. By focusing taxpayer subsidies on the poorest and sickest patients (called “means testing”), innovation can be stimulated while still offering effective care for those who cannot afford it. Government subsidies for poor people will even raise innovative returns by stimulating demand for non-existent markets, as has been the case for innovation in new treatments for HIV, largely paid for by Medicaid.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, the recently enacted health care reforms are taking the U.S. in the opposite direction, offering large subsidies (starting in 2014) to uninsured middle class families making up to $90,000. The subsidies will cover both private insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs. In addition, the reforms impose more price controls by making cuts in the Medicare Advantage program that allows private insurance companies to set prices freely. These new, European-style, open-ended commitments will become unsustainable in the long run, just as some predicted (correctly) would be the case for Medicare. More importantly, the stifling of innovation will make for massive amounts of increased mortality and morbidity in the younger population as they age.                
                

            
                Because the most significant components of Obamacare do not take effect for several years, there is still time to reshape it, both to expand affordable safety-net coverage and encourage innovation. But first we must reject the common assumption that the only form of solidarity worth pursuing is universal coverage – the “right” for all citizens, regardless of their means, to access low-cost medical care. Instead, we must emphasize our solidarity with future generations. Whatever short-term benefits in coverage reforms might bring, our children and grandchildren will inevitably pay the price if the U.S. adopts European-style price controls at the cost of the medical innovations that have done so much for the world.

Obama's Health Care Endgame,"Debate on the controversial Senate health care bill has begun and almost everyone has an opinion. Well, not everyone. Ironically, the administration has yet to go public with its views on what is arguably its most controversial principle in the plan: the public option. It’s a deal breaker for many Democrats in the middle – and even some on the left – and will ignite a civil war in the Senate for the left wing, as I’ve repeatedly predicted.

For months, administration officials have perpetuated the myth that a public option may be best hope when it comes to lowering costs and spurring competition among insurers. However, they’ve declined to say that a public option is a ""must-have"" piece of the legislation.

Budget Director Peter Orszag held a conference call with reporters last week to discuss what he referred to as the “four pillars” of a fiscally responsible health care reform bill – but the public option wasn’t even mentioned.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Why the crickets? Because there’s a good chance that’s it’s dead (we can only hope) and President Obama doesn’t want to marry himself to a losing component of the Senate's overhaul. But if it does pass, he’ll be the first to spike the football. Despite their suspicious silence, we know which team he's really on.                
                

            
                He has sent Senate leaders in to do his dirty work. Amid all this talk that a public option will spark competition, the end game is a single payer system and Obama, and the far left, know it.                
                

            
                “There is a transition process. I can envision a decade out, or 15 years out, or 20 years out,” Obama has said, referring to the possibility of eliminating employer insurance plans entirely.                
                

            
                This means that when they say you can keep your insurance if you like it, you really can’t. Many small business owners will be saddled with such high costs that they’ll force their employees into the government plan.                
                

            
                Senators Joe Lieberman (I) and Blanche Lincoln (D) are opposed to the public option and their votes are needed for passage. Senators Mary Landrieu (D) and Olympia Snowe (R) favor a trigger option.                
                

            
                Keep your eyes peeled for a compromise, but hope that it doesn’t involve the public option or the trigger. Remember the thing about triggers – if they don’t shoot you now, they’ll shoot you later.                
                

            
                Perhaps most ironic, is that the same week that the Senate begins debate on a costly health care restructuring, Obama will also deliver a prime time address to the nation on Tuesday outlining his plan for Afghanistan -- a strategy that will likely mean spending billions more dollars. Watch the liberals howl about cost when it comes to rooting out the Taliban and preventing another attack on American soil, but adding trillions to the national credit card for a government run health care plan? Hey, it's an investment, no matter how unhealthy it is for our fiscal state. -- Oh, the irony.                
                

            
                What could be healthier than the safety of our nation?

A Real Solution for Covering the Uninsured,"Speaking about health care reform in his State of the Union address, President Obama said “But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know.” Now, as America knows, he wants to meet with Congressional  Republicans and Democrats on February 25 to discuss health care reform.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                On February 25, Republicans should seize the opportunity to broadcast the best kept secret of health policy: the uninsured can be covered at relatively modest additional net cost, without a government takeover of health care, rationing, new health care bureaucracies, or any of the other central components of Obamacare.

The lack of a clear safety net for the uninsured is what gives Democrats the political clout to keep coming back for socialized medicine. Republicans should advance the modest reforms necessary to establish a true safety net that will ensure that no one who needs it will be denied essential health care. Only these reforms will permanently protect the health care of the American people from government takeover and control.                
                

            
                Reform should start with Medicaid, which already spends over $400 billion a year providing substandard coverage for 50 million poor Americans. Congress should transform Medicaid to provide assistance to purchase private health insurance for all who otherwise could not afford coverage, ideally with health insurance vouchers.                
                

            
                This one step would enormously benefit the poor already on Medicaid. The program today pays doctors and hospitals only 60% of costs for their health care services for the poor. As a result, 40% of doctors and hospitals won’t take Medicaid patients. This is already a form of rationing, as Medicaid patients find obtaining health care increasingly difficult, and studies show they suffer worse health outcomes as a result. Health insurance vouchers would free the poor from this Medicaid ghetto, enabling them to obtain the same health care as the middle class, because they would be able to buy the same health insurance in the market.                
                

            
                Ideally this would be done by changing Medicaid financing to provide the federal assistance to the states for the program through finite block grants, which would not vary to match increased state Medicaid spending as it does today. States that innovate to reduce costs can then keep the savings. States that operate programs with continued runaway costs would pay those additional costs themselves. Such reforms worked spectacularly well in halting the runaway costs of the old AFDC program when Congress adopted welfare reform in 1996.                
                

            
                The block grants should provide states with increased federal funding that is sufficient, counting state Medicaid funds, to give assistance to all who truly cannot afford health insurance. The voters of each state can then decide how much assistance for the purchase of health insurance to provide families at different income levels. This would, rightly, vary with the different income and cost levels of each state.                
                

            
                Done right, this would ensure that no one would lack health insurance because they couldn’t afford it. But to ensure a complete safety net, federal funding should also be provided for each state to set up an uninsurable risk pool. Those uninsured who become too sick to purchase health insurance in the market for the first time, perhaps because they have cancer or heart disease, would be assured of guaranteed coverage through the risk pool. They would be charged a premium based on their ability to pay. Federal and state funding would cover remaining costs.                
                

            
                Such risk pools already exist in over 30 states, and they work well at relatively little cost to the taxpayers because few people actually become truly uninsurable. This works far better than forcing insurers to cover everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions, or regulations such as guaranteed issue (requiring insurers to cover everyone who applies regardless of health condition) or community rating (requiring insurers to charge everyone the same regardless of health condition). Such regulation naturally causes health insurance premiums to soar. That is because it is akin to requiring insurers to provide fire insurance for houses that are already on fire. With the above reforms, such cost increases would be avoided, while ensuring that everyone has somewhere to go to get essential coverage and care.                
                

            
                The law already provides that insurers cannot cut off existing policyholders, or impose discriminatory rate increases, because they become sick while covered. That would be like allowing fire insurers to cut off coverage for houses once they catch on fire. If this law needs to be modernized, it should be.                
                

            
                With these reforms, those who have insurance can keep it, those who can’t afford it are given help to buy it, and those who nevertheless remain uninsured and then become too sick to buy it still have a back up safety net in the risk pools. Notice that this completely solves the problem of the uninsured without any individual or employer mandates, which are burdensome, unnecessary gateways to enormous trouble. Republicans must also be careful to reject any reform involving health care rationing in any form.

                In his own words, “the shadow of crisis has passed and the state of the union is strong.”                
                

            
                Amongst the areas that we are doing well, President Obama highlighted the fact that we are creating jobs at fastest pace since 1999, that the unemployment rate lower than before the crisis, more Americans are insured than ever before and that we are not dependent on foreign oil for the first time in 30 years.                
                

            
                If only the American people felt that way. The speech was out of step with the wishes of the American people and the realities we are facing at home and abroad.                
                

            
                New Rasmussen polling numbers show that 61% of voters believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction. So even though we have seen economic growth and an unemployment rate under 6% for months now – a lower rate than before the financial crisis – yet most Americans still feel squeezed, short on money and not optimistic about the future.                
                

            
                And they’re afraid. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris, on the heels of the hostage situation in Australia and the slew of ISIS beheadings, have rattled Americans – and for good reason.                
                

            
                Over 80% of the electorate believes that there will be a terrorist attack on American soil. And, unfortunately, in light of what we now have seen is possible in Western nations, it is my belief that they may not be wrong.                
                

            
                In light of this, the president’s claim that we are stopping ISIS’s advance is not only wrong in real terms, but shows an administration that is out of step with American sentiment.                
                

            
                I am not an advocate of another ground war. And I am sympathetic to those that are concerned that if we send troops back to the Middle East, we will end up with another drawn out conflict.                
                

            
                But there is no doubt in my mind – and in the minds of many military officials both serving and retired – that our approach isn’t working.                
                

            
                I wrote last week that it was my hope that the president would be specific and focused in this speech. And that it would be specifically focused on our plan to counteract the threat from radical Islam that is very real.                
                

            
                Needless to say, I didn’t get my wish.                
                

            
                Further, there was almost no talk of policy conciliation in President Obama’s speech, despite ample opportunity for areas of compromise including immigration reform, health care reform, debt, deficit and fiscal reform as well as tax policy and infrastructure.                
                

            
                We heard him reassert his threat to veto any bills that come to his desk that stray from his agenda even while he also argued that “policies work as long as politics don’t get in the way.”                
                

            
                Veto threats are politics. Plain and simple.                
                

            
                And while the president may have to use his veto power – and I do understand it as a presidential right and, sometimes, an imperative – it doesn’t help to advance the state of the union, as it were.                
                

            
                It follows that President Obama’s plan for the next two years is to continue down the road that he has been going down for the first six years. He will focus his policies on middle class families and lowering taxes for working families; ensuring that Americans get universal childcare and paid sick leave and that women earn the same as men and that we raise the minimum wage; closing tax loopholes and raising taxes on the rich.                
                

            
                These are important goals and policies that by and large I agree with. But redistributionist policies are not the only solutions that are worthwhile to explore.                
                

            
                We need to do more and to combine both the Democratic and Republican agenda. And while President Obama ended his speech with the type of language we heard after the midterms – “we need debate without demonizing each other,” he said – it is still not clear that the president is willing to practice what he preaches."
Will Obama Take 'Responsibility' For the Baucus Bill?,"Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) will make one more attempt this week to get Republicans to join the Democrats health care reform plans. Some breathed a sigh of relief that his health care bill does not include a government-run insurance program. Those who listened to President Obama's health care address to Congress last week noted that much. But the proposed regulations will destroy private insurance, guaranteeing another debate in a couple of years to fix the disastrous shape that these regulations will leave health care in.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The most striking part of the plan is that it is partially paid for it with taxes on different health care companies. Health insurance is thus taxed at the same time Democrats are claiming they want to encourage more people getting private insurance. Democrats seem to think that taxes (or ""fees"" as the bill calls them) won't raise costs and thus prices for insurance. But of course it does. Yet, an anonymous source in the Senate told Politico: ""If insurance companies pass this fee along to customers, they run the risk of losing out in a newly competitive environment."" Unfortunately, taxes would raise prices no matter how competitive insurance markets are. Furthermore, the proposed regulations will reduce competition by driving insurance companies out of business.                
                

            
                Regulations would eliminate any caps on the benefits insurance companies provide. It sounds wonderful, whether your health care costs total a million or ten million dollars, insurance companies will be required to cover it. Right now people have a choice over how much coverage they want. The more they pay in premiums, the more coverage they receive. But Democrats are promising that we can get these unlimited benefits as well as tax the insurance companies and enjoy lower insurance premiums at the same time.                
                

            
                On CBS's ""60 Minutes"" this past Sunday, President Obama promised that these reforms will stop insurance premiums from going up. ""And if people look and say, 'you know what? This hasn't reduced my costs. My premiums are still going up 25%, insurance companies are still jerkin' me around,' I'm the one who's going to be held responsible,"" Obama said. His claim that he is going to be ""held responsible"" seems debatable because the safe guess is that he will continue to blame the insurance companies for any future problems.                
                

            
                There are even worse provisions in the Obama/Baucus plan. One of them prevents insurance companies from charging more to those with pre-existing conditions before they bought insurance. If people are not required to have insurance, this rule would encourage people to wait until they were sick enough to get insurance. Since it would primarily be those who were already sick who would chose to get insurance, premiums would soar. And even if people are required to have insurance, people would initially get the lowest benefit plan. Once they are sick, they would then switch to the best insurance plan available. Pretty soon only the lowest benefit plans would be left.                
                

            
                The Obama/Baucus plan doesn't force people to buy insurance; it requires them to pay a tax if they don't. But the tax is so low that the end result will be the same as not requiring people to buy insurance. The tax for those who don't buy insurance ranges from $750 for the poorest single people to as high as $3,800 a year for families. Even without unlimited insurance benefits, the average insurance cost today is much higher: in 2008, it was on average $4,704 for individuals and $12,682 for families. But with no penalty for having a pre-existing condition, people will pay the tax and wait to buy insurance once they get sick. If people only buy insurance once they are already sick, insurance premiums will soar dramatically. In short order there will be much higher insurance premiums.                
                

            
                Of course, the bill also imposes taxes on pharmaceutical manufacturers, medical device makers and clinical laboratories. Obviously that would simultaneously raise health care costs and lower the return to developing new drugs and medical devices. Yet, we keep on hearing that Democrats want to lower health care costs, not raise them. If Democrats really think that all these other taxes also won't raise prices, we suggest that they try consulting with an economist or two.

Even without a public option, this bill will create massive problems for private health insurance. The regulations will decimate private insurance and make it easier for Democrats to then pass their government-run insurance bill.

Follow Your Doctor's Advice,"Last week, as President Obama explained health care reform was ""a core ethical and moral obligation,"" America's physicians said his proposed reforms would challenge the ethical and moral obligations embedded in their professional standards.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In a poll commissioned by the American Society of Medical Doctors, 70 percent of specialty physicians who responded said they opposed current Congressional and White House proposals for health care reform. And 66 percent of those doctors said a government-run health insurance plan would restrict doctors'ability to give the best advice and offer the best care possible to their patients.                
                

            
                Physicians have also begun citing their Hippocratic oath when expressing opposition to current health care reform proposals. This creates an interesting juxtaposition to the president's call for what he sees as a moral obligation. For physicians, their ethics are deeply grounded in that oath and anything that interferes with the oath interferes with their moral obligations to their patients.
They are not to be taken lightly; their understanding of moral issues in the practice of medicine is highly developed. Furthermore, their support and involvement in any reform effort is crucial for its success.                
                

            
                Consider this: specialty physicians' view of government-run health insurance is so strong that they would rather reject patients carrying that insurance than attempt to treat them through a bureaucratic barrier. In the ASMD poll, more than 60 percent said they would not accept new patients with government insurance. More than a quarter (27 percent) said they would not accept any patients on the new government plan -- that's new OR existing patients.                
                

            
                These numbers also highlight the other side of what the president has said about ""if you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor."" You actually can't keep your doctor if he/she won't see you anymore. And if you're one of the people who gets stuck with government insurance, that could very well end up being the case.                
                

            
                Furthermore, if you are looking for a new doctor -- say, a specialist like an ophthalmologist, dermatologist, OBGYN or orthopedist -- and you have that government insurance, well, your pool of choices could be reduced by 60 percent. If you live in a rural area with limited choices to begin with, you might be really stuck.                
                

            
                How is that a moral victory for anyone?                
                

            
                It is clear that America's doctors overwhelmingly believe that the health care reform proposals being pushed by Congressional Democrats and the Obama administration violate their most fundamental principle: first, do no harm.                
                

            
                If Congress and the president want to hear informed, moral opinions on health care, they'd do well to listen to doctors.

                One motivation for all this outreach is economic. ObamaCare will work better if young people sign up, because they are relatively healthy. The Obama team wanted youth to vote in 2008 and 2012 and now hopes they will make a financial decision to join the health exchanges.                
                

            
                But the White House would also like young people to support ObamaCare as a policy. That would help the president’s sagging poll numbers, which may be a drag on his party this November. And it would address the really serious and long-term political question, which is what lessons Millennials draw from this era in our history.                
                

            
                As someone who directs and studies the political and civic participation of our nation’s youth, I find that the political orientation of each generation tends to be set in young adulthood.                 
                

            
                The generation that came of age under Franklin D. Roosevelt decided that Herbert Hoover’s minimal government had failed and that federal programs could help them. They formed the New Deal Coalition for half a century and still fight for Social Security today.                 
                

            
                The generation that reached voting age with Ronald Reagan remains skeptical of government and relatively libertarian.                
                

            
                Thus the stakes are very high: the next fifty years of American politics and policy will be strongly influenced by the conclusions that the Millennials derive from the present moment.                
                

            
                In 2008, polls showed them strongly supportive of government action to address issues like health and education. Analyzing polling data going all the way back to the 1960s, we find that Millennials were the most pro-government generation on record, as of 2008.                
                

            
                But it is clear that their enthusiasm has been shaken since then.                 
                

            
                Politics has been an ugly business. Even though many youth would blame Congress more than the president for the bitter stalemate in Washington, it’s still hard to be enthusiastic about a federal program if you despise the institutions that oversee it.                
                

            
                Quite a few Millennials peeled off from the Obama coalition because they stood to the left of the president on the health care bill itself (preferring a single payer system or at least the “public option”), not to mention issues like Afghanistan and the NSA surveillance debate. These young people are not likely to vote Republican unless they are drawn to GOP candidates who stake out strongly civil libertarian positions on issues like surveillance. But their enthusiasm for mainstream Democrats is very much in question.                
                

            
                I have never seen persuasive evidence that media outreach and celebrity appeals can change fundamental opinions about policy and politics. Obama’s visit to “Between Two Ferns” will not be the turning point in the administration’s efforts.                 
                

            
                So what should they do to get young people involved in health reform?                
                

            
                First, they could try to alter the design of ObamaCare to encourage more engagement. Critics say that the Affordable Health Care Act “socializes” medicine, but in fact, individuals must buy their own health insurance plans from private vendors on an exchange, albeit with a subsidy if they qualify.                 
                

            
                You are supposed to sit alone at your computer screen deciding which option is best for you and your family.                 
                

            
                The bill could have been written so that various kinds of organizations and groups could participate together. For instance, unions and churches could have been allowed to enroll, and people could have been given opportunities to found new groups that would sign up together. Then young people would have had the chance to help build organizations.                
                

            
                It is not necessarily too late to change ObamaCare in this direction. In fact, the Affordable Health Care provides $11 billion for community health centers that are governed by local residents. A broad coalition called Health Access California has signed up millions for ObamaCare and also worked on other aspects of public health since 1987. Health Access California was not created by the law but has used it effectively. Few know about these efforts.                
                

            
                If the participatory aspects of the law were strengthened and publicized, many young people would take part and see themselves as agents of change. Our research consistently finds that when Millennials are offered opportunities to address public issues, they step up.                
                

            
                Second, the administration could engage young people to advocate for health care reform. We estimate that in 2008, more than 4 percent of all young adults volunteered for a political campaign--the highest number ever recorded, and higher than the rate for older people that same year.                 
                

            
                Some worked for John McCain or for state and local candidates, but the lion’s share volunteered for Obama. They represented a potential mass movement to support health care reform in Congress and to sign people up for the new program once it was enacted.                
                

            
                But since then, the administration has taken only token efforts to engage these young people. Young voters basically ended up on the email list of Organizing for America, which morphed into Organizing for Action. Neither organization has been a movement or even a space for discussion.                
                

            
                The 2008 Obama campaign was creative and courageous about engaging young supporters. Youth were encouraged to develop their own messages and build local organizations in support of the candidate.                 
                

            
                Since then, neither the Obama administration nor the Democratic Party has innovated very impressively or shared much power with their grassroots allies. They have created some public online forums, but their main idea right now seems to be sending the president onto comedy shows, much as Bill Clinton played his sax on the ""Aresenio Hall Show"" in 1992.                
                

            
                Over the next year or so, young Americans may draw several alternative lessons from ObamaCare. The conclusions they reach will affect their view of politics for decades to come.                
                

            
                First, they may decide that health reform was a failure, even a fiasco, and draw the general lesson that the government is incompetent or untrustworthy. That would move them to the right. Republicans have every reason to drive this lesson home.                
                

            
                Second, youth may decide that ObamaCare worked.                 
                

            
                Despite all the fireworks, it was actually a rather modest tweak in the private health insurance market, a set of rules and incentives that will shift some people’s behavior. They may conclude that expert-driven reforms can benefit society and that Republicans have just stood in the way of progress. That would keep youth on the center-left.                
                

            
                Third, they might possibly decide that we (not just the government or a few experts) have improved our health care system. If young people become heavily involved in community health centers and efforts like Health Access California, they would see themselves directly improving the nation’s health. They would say that it wasn’t Barack Obama but the American people who broadened health coverage and began to cut costs.                 
                

            
                That conclusion would generate a new spirit of responsibility and creativity that would not belong narrowly to the right or the left.                
                

            
                But to get it started would take a lot more than bantering with Zach Galifianakis.

Sean Hannity: GOP must come together to save Trump agenda,"Now Playing                            Hannity: Freedom Caucus not to blame for health care failure                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                After the House Republican leadership's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare stalled in Congress, the mainstream media decided the Trump presidency is dead in the water.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Since taking office, President Trump has been checking off his campaign promises, one by one. It’s obvious that the president has been moving very fast and effectively, at what I call “the speed of Trump.” And now, there’s a danger that infighting in the Republican Party could undermine the president's agenda.                
                

            
                Trump even noted this potential problem with a Thursday morning tweet aimed at House conservatives who some blame for the health care reform debacle.                
                

            
                ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda,” Trump tweeted. “If they don't get on the team and fast, we must fight them and Dems in 2018.""                
                

            
                The president is clearly frustrated with this division in the Republican Party. It’s understandable.                
                

            
                For seven long years, the GOP ran on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.  ""Give us the House,"" they said. They got it in 2010. ""Give us the Senate,"" they said. They got it in 2014. ""Give us the White House,"" they said. On Nov. 8, they got the last piece of the puzzle.                
                

            
                Republicans should control Washington. And they should have a unified plan to implement their agenda.                
                

            
                In my opinion, it's not the Freedom Caucus that's responsible for the GOP failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The legislation put forward by the House leadership was flawed from the beginning. It was created behind closed doors, and no Freedom Caucus members saw it until it was rolled out. That made it a disaster.                
                

            
                I don't know who is telling the White House to focus its anger on the Freedom Caucus, but it's misplaced. The members of the Freedom Caucus have told me personally that they want to make a deal and they want the win for the president and the country.                
                

            
                My advice to Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of Congress is simple: Get all the differing factions in your caucus together. Get them together with senators like Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Mitch McConnell and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.                
                

            
                Get everybody in a room, lock the door, order pizza and beer. Don’t come out until you have a consensus bill like the one you've been promising the country for eight years. And when you do, take it straight to the president's desk.                
                

            
                Your mission is to keep your promise. It's not ideology. It's what's good for the American people and it is no more and no less than what you said you would do.

Analysis: Press Largely Ignored Incendiary Rhetoric at Bush Protest,"News outlets that are focusing on the incendiary rhetoric of conservatives outside President Obama's town hall meeting Tuesday ignored the incendiary rhetoric -- and even violence -- of liberals outside an appearance by former President George W. Bush in 2002.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                When Bush visited Portland, Ore., for a fundraiser, protesters stalked his motorcade, assailed his limousine and stoned a car containing his advisers. Chanting ""Bush is a terrorist!"", the demonstrators bullied passers-by, including gay softball players and a wheelchair-bound grandfather with multiple sclerosis.                
                

            
                One protester even brandished a sign that seemed to advocate Bush's assassination. The man held a large photo of Bush that had been doctored to show a gun barrel pressed against his temple.                
                

            
                ""BUSH: WANTED, DEAD OR ALIVE,"" read the placard, which had an X over the word ""ALIVE.""                
                

            
                Another poster showed Bush's face with the words: ""F--- YOU, MOTHERF---ER!""                
                

            
                A third sign urged motorists to ""HONK IF YOU HATE BUSH."" A fourth declared: ""CHRISTIAN FASCISM,"" with a swastika in place of the letter S in each word.                
                

            
                Although reporters from numerous national news organizations were traveling with Bush and witnessed the protest, none reported that protesters were shrieking at Republican donors epithets like ""Slut!"" ""Whore!"" and ""Fascists!""                
                

            
                Frank Dulcich, president and CEO of Pacific Seafood Group, had a cup of liquid thrown into his face, and then was surrounded by a group of menacing protesters, including several who wore masks. Donald Tykeson, 75, who had multiple sclerosis and was confined to a wheelchair, was blocked by a thug who threatened him.                
                

            
                Protesters slashed the tires of several state patrol cruisers and leapt onto an occupied police car, slamming the hood and blocking the windshield with placards. A female police officer was knocked to the street by advancing protesters, badly injuring her wrist.                
                

            
                The angry protest grew so violent that the Secret Service was forced to take the highly unusual step of using a backup route for Bush's motorcade because the primary route had been compromised by protesters, one of whom pounded his fist on the president's moving limousine.                
                

            
                All the while, angry demonstrators brandished signs with incendiary rhetoric, such as ""9/11 - YOU LET IT HAPPEN, SHRUB,"" and ""BUSH: BASTARD CHILD OF THE SUPREME COURT."" One sign read: ""IMPEACH THE COURT-APPOINTED JUNTA AND THE FASCIST, EGOMANIACAL, BLOOD-SWILLING BEAST!""                
                

            
                Yet none of these signs were cited in the national media's coverage of the event. By contrast, the press focused extensively on over-the-top signs held by Obama critics at the president's town hall event held Tuesday in New Hampshire.                
                

            
                The lead story in Wednesday's Washington Post, for example, is headlined: ""Obama Faces 'Scare Tactics' Head-On.""                
                

            
                ""As the president spoke, demonstrators outside held posters declaring him a socialist and dubbing him 'Obamahdinejad,' in reference to Iran's president,"" the Post reported. ""People screamed into bullhorns to protest a bigger government role in health care. 'Nobama Deathcare!' one sign read. A young girl held up a sign that said: 'Obama Lies, Grandma Dies.' Images of a protester wearing what appeared to be a gun were shown on television.""                
                

            
                On Sunday, The New York Times reported that a Democratic congressman discovered that ""an opponent of health care reform hanged him in effigy"" and was confronted by ""200 angry conservatives."" The article lamented ""increasingly ugly scenes of partisan screaming matches, scuffles, threats and even arrests.""                
                

            
                No such coverage was given to the Portland protest of Bush by The New York Times or the Washington Post, which witnessed the protest.

"1 year after Newtown, support for stricter gun control has disappeared","Now Playing                            Gun control advocates politicizing Newtown tragedy?                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Obama has pushed hard for gun control this year and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions of dollars on ads, but the administration's promise to coordinate ""a November lobbying effort and plan events to commemorate the first anniversary of the Newtown, Connecticut"" has gotten little traction.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Last year the Newtown shooting, with it horrific slaughter, lead to an immediate national movement for gun control. But that was short-lived, and opposition to gun control is currently very strong. Indeed, it appears to be the strongest in decades.                
                

            
                A recent CNN poll finds the highest level of opposition to any new gun control measures since CNN started asking about it in 1989. Rising from only 28 percent opposed to new gun control measures then to 50 percent today. And it's not the only poll with such findings. Gallup finds that opposition to stricter laws has risen from 19 to 50 percent.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                What’s more, these polls don’t reflect that most people in favor of gun control don’t have strong feelings about it. Monthly Gallup polls from June to October this year reveal it’s just not viewed as a pressing issue.

                In fact, it didn't even make the list of top 15 issues that Americans were most concerned about. In only one month, May, did as many as 7 percent of Americans say that they were most concerned about gun control (and that includes both sides of the issue), but since June it has ranged between 1 and 3 percent.                
                

            
                Recent newspaper headlines mirror these polls. Over the last couple days the Washington Post announced ""How gun control is losing, badly (in charts)"" or ""Gun-control groups are shifting efforts and resources to handful of states.""                 
                

            
                Even at the state level the New York Times paints an anemic movement, counting up the passage of state gun laws, 39 tightening restrictions and 70 liberalizing them.                
                

            
                It almost seems as if gun control advocates like the New York Times are going out of their way to make their side look weak.                 
                

            
                The more restrictive laws are going to do a lot more to reduce gun ownership than the liberalizations will increase it.                 
                

            
                Maryland is now going to charge over $350 to license and register handguns and buyers will have to undergo four hours of training.                 
                

            
                Yet, the Times viewed that as equivalent to West Virginia’s change that exempts concealed-carry permit holders who have already undergone background checks from another background check when they buy a gun.                
                

            
                A frequent claim by control advocates this year has been that 80 percent to 90 percent of Americans are in favor of expanded background-checks legislation. But the polls showing such overwhelming support really ask little more than whether people want to stop criminals from obtaining guns, not whether voters actually favor the legislation that the Senate was voting on.                
                

            
                The actual laws being discussed were much less popular.                 
                

            
                For example, a mid-April poll by the Pew Research Center provides one such illustration when it asks voters whether they were happy that the Senate bill had been defeated. While 67 percent of Democrats were “disappointed” or “angry” about the defeat, more Republicans and independents were “ very happy” or “relieved” than upset by the defeat.                
                

            
                But gun control advocates aren’t giving up. They are patient, and they have money.                 
                

            
                Mayor Bloomberg recently donated $250 million to the Bloomberg School of Public Health for 40 new academic positions, many of whom will deal with gun control issues. And that is in addition to the 8 people already doing so at the school.                 
                

            
                Similarly, President Obama met with 23 foundations in January where they agreed to shift their focus from health care reform to gun control issues.                
                

            
                As if that wasn't enough, in June the federal government’s National Research Council issued a new report supporting Obama's push for federal funding of research on gun issues. The lopsidedness of the report is just a sign of things to come, of research to be funded by the Obama administration.                
                

            
                The newest strategy by gun control advocates seems to be a stealth strategy -- sneaking in fees and taxes for obtaining guns. These are penalties that will reduce gun ownership, particular for the very people who need them the most, the most likely victims of crime, the poor in high-crime urban neighborhoods.                
                

            
                Alas, the issue of gun control isn’t going away any time soon.

Economist: Trump says he wants real growth for America. Can he deliver?,"President Trump’s economic team paints a rosier picture of what his policies can accomplish than the economics profession is willing to endorse.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                Trump’s team is formulating budget and tax proposals that project 3 percent annual growth, while the number crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate only 1.9 percent.
                
                


                
            
                How fast the economy can grow comes down to the simple sum of likely worker productivity and labor force growth. Since the financial crisis, productivity has advanced about 1 percent a year, compared to 2 percent in prior decades.
                
                


                
            
                Thanks to baby boomer retirements and a declining birth rate, the prime working age population — those aged 25 to 65 — is not likely to grow even 1 percent annually — even with well-conceived, needs-based immigration reforms and changes in entitlement programs that encourage more adults to work.
                
                


                
            
                The premise underlying Trump’s program — lower taxes, health care reform, deregulation, infrastructure spending and tougher trade policies to lower the import deficit — is to make the United States a more attractive location for investment and innovation than, for example, China or Mexico.
                
                


                
            
                There’s no doubt that cutting corporate and personal income taxes and spending more on roads and highways could give the economy a Keynesian jolt and raise growth above 3 percent for a few quarters. But Trump’s policy reforms are likely to be watered down by political infighting.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                The prospects that those proposals will carry long-term punch for productivity and growth are limited by congressional politics and, perhaps more fundamentally, by conditions limiting the efficacy of pushing up investment through tax cuts.
                
                


                
            
                As with health care, the GOP in Congress is sharply divided on tax reform. For example, should corporate reform tax imports to make the package revenue neutral, or should we accept a somewhat bigger federal deficit? Also, Trump and Speaker Ryan are unlikely to get much help from Democrats to forge a bipartisan majority.
                
                


                
            
                Similarly, using private money to improve roads and bridges has some potential, but many improvements will likely require unpopular new taxes and user fees. Trump’s promise to get tough on trade faces strong opposition even among skeptics inside his own White House.
                
                


                
            
                More importantly, though, many economists believe low labor productivity growth is baked into the cake. Led by Northwestern University Professor Robert Gordon, most hew to the notion that the faster pace of productivity growth accomplished during the American industrial era — roughly 1870 to 1970 — resulted from groundbreaking innovations like electricity, the interstate highway system and antibiotics. The effects of those innovations are not likely to be repeated.
                
                


                
            
                These days, they say, important new technologies — game machines and handheld devices that permit comparison shopping while roaming the aisles at Target — do more to entertain and enhance our leisure time than boost productivity.
                
                


                
            
                The problem is that economists are really good at explaining what just happened — in this case, the productivity slowdown of the last few decades — but are lousy at telling us much about the future.
                
                


                
            
                Our models look at recent trends, cast them in concrete and then extrapolate into the future. They can’t accurately predict GDP growth two or three quarters from now, never mind tell us much about how emerging innovations will change work and the broader contours of the economy one or several decades into the future.
                
                


                
            
                Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and robotics — from robots that perform routine tooth repairs for dentists to artificial intelligence programs that accelerate the work of automobile and fashion designers — have the potential to replace up to 90 percent of current job categories, or at least to make workers occupying most positions profoundly more efficient.
                
                


                
            
                In the decades ahead, machines that can feel and think — replacing the tactile advantages of the human hand and genuinely solving tough problems, as opposed to merely accelerating the searching and processing of information — will boost productivity in ways we can hardly fathom.
                
                


                
            
                Vision and imagination have a way of winning out over pessimism and ossified thinking. Perhaps it’s a good thing that the White House has only a thin representation of economists and other experts telling President Trump what can’t be achieved.
                
                


                
            
                Trump’s supporters keep talking about rekindling animal spirits, but perhaps they will fill America’s biggest deficit — the lack of confidence that vexing challenges can be turned to our advantage.

Has Obama Become Radioactive?,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                If you're looking to analyze Barack Obama's first year in office, look no further than yesterday's special election in the Bay State. It’s symbolic -- and very telling -- that one year after Obama’s inauguration, the Democratic candidate, Martha Coakley, was beaten by newcomer populist Scott Brown, losing Ted Kennedy's seat in a traditionally blue stronghold. More notably: twelve months after Obama was sworn into the office of the president and a sea of blue swept Washington, the Democratic Party is now on the verge of implosion.

Despite the spin that Democrats and the White House are pushing -- that the Massachusetts election has nothing to do with national issues, that Martha Coakley is a poor candidate, or that she ran a bad campaign, or that it was George W. Bush's fault she lost (according to Howard Dean last night on MSNBC) -- this race wasn't about Boston's Big Dig or Dubya. It was Barack Obama’s report card, and its outcome is a referendum on the policies and record of his first year in office.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Massachusetts translates to a failing grade for the administration and congressional Democrats led by Nancy Pelosi and the inarticulate Harry Reid, for their insistence on sticking to, and pushing through, a progressive, radical agenda that the American people overwhelmingly reject. (Note: Lady Nancy Macbeth has said she will move full speed ahead on health care. We're not exactly sure how with members defecting but let this quote be a sign of her arrogance).

If you thought infighting was bad before, prepare for some serious Dem on Dem violence and an every member for himself mentality. Senate and House Democratic electeds facing re-election in the fall will run for the hills and from the Hill—specifically Capitol Hill and the White House, while their Republican challengers begin to cut campaign ads featuring the unpopular President and congressional leadership.                
                

            
                The president is now radioactive, as Bush was in 2008. Democratic leadership will face insurmountable challenges trying to rally their troops and pass any piece of legislation going forward, while they rightly bury their disastrous 2,000+ page health reform bills.

But is he smart enough to call Dick Morris, Clinton's triangulating savior?

Unlike Clinton who bucked his base (at Morris' insistence) and moved to the middle after health care reform attempt failed, Obama is an ideologue, a Kool-Aid drinker who really believes in the ""government takes all"" mentality. (Bill Clinton also had his wife to blame for Hillarycare. The only thing Obama can pin on Michelle are some stunt vegetables used in the series finale of ""Top Chef"").                
                

            
                It's ironic that the only hope and change the country is experiencing is a hope that Obama will change his own plans.

When it comes to Reid and Pelosi, they're both in more imminent trouble than Obama. Reid will likely not survive his own election in Nevada. And Democrats may alter course on their own and oust Nancy Pelosi in the fall if more losses ensue. She has done nothing but harm to her caucus and to the President. (Psssst -- John Boehner: get the tape measure out to measure for new drapes in her office).                
                

            
                Now, across the country, any populist looking to run for office -- even in blue states -- has a renewed belief that anything is possible.

Both parties take note: Americans want open, responsible and balanced government. They spoke and they were loud and clear. The takeaway was obvious: the momentum is real and the outrage is not manufactured.

"JUAN WILLIAMS: If Capitol Hill Is High School, Michele Bachmann Is the 'It' Girl of the Moment","If Capitol Hill is really one big high school, the “It” girl of the moment is Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.).                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                A recent Gallup poll of Republicans found Bachmann had the second-highest positive intensity rating of any of the potential 2012 candidates in the GOP field. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and my colleague at Fox, came in first.                
                

            
                In the last week alone, newspapers ranging from The New York Times to The Washington Times have run profiles on Bachmann full of speculation about her next move in the GOP presidential contest. She has made numerous trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, suggesting she might make a run for the presidency as either a Republican or a third party, Tea Party-backed candidate. TV’s John McLaughlin declared on his show that Bachmann will be the 2012 Republican nominee for vice president.                
                

            
                But what about Bachmann’s current job?                
                

            
                She is the founder and leader of the 52-member House Tea Party Caucus and serves on two key committees: Intelligence and Financial Services. And in amazing fashion, she now seems to be running her own shadow Republican caucus in which she is speaker, floor leader, whip and conference chairwoman for the Tea Party passions that threaten to split Republicans on the Hill.                
                

            
                She tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up the most recent continuing resolution because of a hitherto unseen $105 billion in healthcare reform funding. She managed to corral 54 “no” votes, mostly from freshmen Republicans, and gave the impression that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) cannot control his own caucus.                
                

            
                Bachmann’s rock-star status on the far right has put the House GOP leadership in a difficult position. She is undermining the ability of the Republican majority in the House to govern.                
                

            
                She raised eyebrows by giving a Tea Party response to the State of the Union, stealing the spotlight from the official Republican respondent, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Bachmann is likely to be in the spotlight again this week with Tea Party Patriots rallying at the Capitol against Republicans in the leadership — Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Ryan — who are trying to reach a compromise on the 2011 budget and the debt ceiling. It is easy to forget that in January she lost her bid for chairman of the House Republican Conference, the No. 4 leadership spot.                
                

            
                On talk radio and conservative websites, the congresswoman is the star witness against any budget deal. She argues with fury and sparkling eyes that proposed cuts in spending have been too shallow and there is no need to fear a government shutdown. Bachmann is also livid that health care reform is the law of the land, oblivious to the fact that it is increasingly popular with the public and every effort to reverse it can be blocked by the Democratically-controlled Senate.                
                

            
                Will she attempt to derail the next continuing resolution because she deems it to be insufficiently conservative? How about the vote to raise the debt ceiling? How long will the GOP leadership indulge her antics on important votes? Can they really do anything to stop her?                
                

            
                Boehner must be careful how he deals with Bachmann and her supporters. Ohio Tea Party activists have already launched a phone campaign in his home district to complain he is not a true conservative for failing to block a possible debt-limit increase. Judson Phillips, founder of Tea Party Nation, is openly looking for a recruit to run against Boehner in the next primary. “Charlie Sheen is now making more sense than John Boehner,” a mocking Phillips wrote recently.                
                

            
                So as the next election draws closer, Boehner might need Bachmann and her Tea Party credibility as a working member of Congress to mollify those brash, uncompromising forces in the party. And the Speaker could also use her unrivaled stature to push back against Tea Party primary challenges to several vulnerable Republicans who are loyal to him.                
                

            
                If Bachmann plays her cards right and begins to pick her battles more strategically, she could have considerable leverage on the Hill. However, the business of being a serious legislator and political power broker is not always fun. It certainly cannot be as fun as going on television every night, flirting with a run for president and being talked about as the leader of a radical political movement.                
                

            
                But Bachmann is also dancing on the razor’s edge of becoming marginalized as someone who is not serious — a self-serving celebrity, in high school lingo a “Mean Girl.”                
                

            
                That is the same toxic formula that has led to Sarah Palin’s falling poll numbers. Boehner might decide the smart play is to take on Bachmann in an effort to increase his appeal to mainstream Republicans, independents and conservative Democrats.                
                

            
                The “It” girl may just be the one to bring out the tough guy in John Boehner.

                There's been a recent flurry of activities attempting to boost the Affordable Care Act. In mid-June, for example, President Obama's ""Organizing for Action"" group reportedly spent seven figures on TV ads (in California, Florida and Texas) claiming, ""Americans are already seeing the benefits"" of health-care reform.

                Also in June, the administration and an allied nonprofit, Enroll America, described how hundreds of thousands of community organizers will sign up seven million uninsured people for health coverage, once registration for subsidized insurance starts Oct. 1.

But the rule of law won't stop this White House from trying to reduce the damage from ObamaCare until after the 2014 midterm elections.

                 Are the Tea Partiers Too Late?Yes. This train’s left the station and it’s time to focus on changing Congress in November.
I’m not sure, but IF the train’s left the station I’m sure glad someone’s still yelling about it.
No. There still are enough Democrats on the fence – keep up the pressure.

Olive Garden serves up better menu of health insurance options,"(AP)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Recently, Sears and Darden Restaurants (the parent company of Red Lobster and Olive Garden) revealed plans to change how they provide benefits to their workers. Instead of selecting a plan for the workers, the two companies will give them cash directly to purchase insurance from an online marketplace. Creating private insurance exchanges is a simple but potentially game-changing approach to health insurance coverage.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Private exchanges put choice back in the hands of employees. Those who want cheaper plans with lower coverage pay less; those who want more comprehensive coverage will pay more.                
                

            
                Employees will see exactly what their plan costs and the coverage they receive, allowing them to make smarter choices with their money. And existing federal rules (pre-ObamaCare) for group insurance ensure that employees won’t be charged higher prices if they become sick and can’t be denied coverage if they change jobs and shift to the individual insurance market, as long as they keep their coverage current.                
                

            
                Though similar in name, ObamaCare, aka the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) takes the basic idea of market-based health-insurance exchanges and buries it beneath a morass of new taxes and heavy-handed regulations                
                

            
                Supporters claim that PPACA applies market principles to help control health costs. The health-insurance exchanges the law establishes allow uninsured individuals to purchase insurance using a combination of their own money and federal premium subsidies (and in some cases cost-sharing subsidies) that scale with income (up to 400% of the federal poverty line). So nominally at least, PPACA does harness market forces. But there are some very important caveats.                
                

            
                For starters, the exchanges are loaded with regulations and taxes that will drive up the cost of insurance in the individual and small-group markets. PPACA’s minimum-coverage provisions (called “essential health benefits”) include coverage for mental-health and substance-abuse services, rehabilitative and habilitative services, medical devices, and pediatric dental and vision care. This is a significantly richer and more costly set of benefits than is commonly sold to individuals and small businesses today. The CBO estimates that premiums will rise by close to 30 percent because of this.                
                

            
                PPACA also limits insurers’ ability to offer lower prices to younger and healthier applicants or charge higher prices to sicker and older enrollees. This restriction will also drive insurance prices up, particularly for the young, healthy people that we should be encouraging to buy (and keep) insurance.                
                

            
                Finally, PPACA includes billions in taxes on insurers, drug companies, and medical-device companies that will be mostly passed on to consumers in the form of higher insurance premiums. Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the insurance tax alone will add close to $400 annually to family premiums in 2016. Because the taxes require aggregate amounts to be collected from insurance companies – $14 billion by 2018 – if one insurer’s payout declines, other insurers have to make up the difference. PPACA’s tax structure will likely motivate insurers to merge—reducing competition and further driving up costs for consumers.
 
 Even its supporters admit that PPACA will drive costs up. Although he previously said that PPACA would “for sure” will lower costs, former Obama administration health advisor Jonathan Gruber now admits that the law will drive up individual insurance premiums – by 40% in Maine and Minnesota, and by 20% in Colorado. Other analysts predict increases of as much as 85% in Ohio and 95% in Indiana. Rates for small businesses are expected to rise as well, although not as much.
 
 Creating private, employer-based insurance exchanges is a great start.  Private exchanges are much better positioned to offer high quality coverage without new taxes and expensive new regulations.  And new insurance reform proposals offered by the GOP’s Romney-Ryan ticket would improve them even further.
 
 Employer-based exchange plans remain group plans, and if employees lose their jobs they’d have to pay the full cost of coverage out of pocket, without the tax benefit that comes with employer-based coverage.  Individuals may also face higher prices in the individual market later if they become sick. The rules vary by state.                
                

            
                Here’s where sensible reforms suggested by Governor Romney and Paul Ryan would improve the market while avoiding PPACA’s high costs.                 
                

            
                First, insurance policies have to be truly portable. Romney-Ryan would level the playing field by giving individually-purchased health plans the same tax advantage that employer health plans receive, making insurance much more affordable.                 
                

            
                Second, they’d also reform insurance rules to ensure that as long as you kept your coverage, you wouldn’t have to worry about paying a higher price if you got sick.                
                

            
                This would encourage more companies to open insurance exchanges and help their employees navigate them to find the best value. States wouldn’t have to spend money to open their own exchanges – although they could opt to, if it made sense in their local markets. High-risk pools could be created with relatively modest funding from Washington for the small number of people with pre-existing conditions who can’t find affordable coverage.                
                

            
                By repealing PPACA’s expensive regulations and taxes, the Romney-Ryan plan would also help lower the cost of health insurance. And by creating rules permitting the purchase of insurance across state lines, the GOP plan would help individuals find more affordable plans that fit their families’ needs – without being told what they have to purchase by lobbyists and bureaucrats in Washington.                
                

            
                Private health-insurance exchanges can serve as a model for real health-care reform – especially if the insurance they sell is made truly portable while protecting individuals from future rate increases as long as they stayed insured. It’s a simple, elegant approach that would improve American health care at low cost.

Obama's Sneaky Attack on Education,"“We seek to help an additional five million Americans earn degrees and certificates in the next decade,” said President Obama in July 2009. However, looking at the policies his administration is proposing, it is starting to sound more like “We seek to help Americans earn degrees that we think are worth earning, as we see fit, under our micromanagement.”

First, thanks to the president's health care law – not a separate education bill – the feds will now lend directly to students instead of guaranteeing bank loans as they have done, with good success, for 45 years. One can’t help but wonder: “With what money will the federal government make these loans? With money we borrow from China?” Which begs the question “Does China have enough money to finance education loans on top of government-run health care reform?”

And now there is more news on the Obama higher education agenda: Private sector institutions of higher education are in the crosshairs of federal loan program officials. And there is no bill, health care or otherwise, for this item. Instead, the Obama Education Department is doing what clever political appointees do best: adjusting regulations in order to change policy and skip that whole pesky legislative branch step.

The regulatory changes will make qualifying for a loan nearly impossible for tens of thousands of young adults who dare enroll in a school that, gasp, tries to make a profit. You needn’t worry if you are looking to enroll in a public school (i.e.: a state university or community college) or a private college (those are non-profits). But if you are seeking a vocational education, associate’s or bachelor’s degree from a school that runs itself more like a business, you might be in a tough spot very soon.

Most people know these for-profit schools as the ones that advertise on television. Their advertising targets a working class audience trying to improve their career choices. The schools’ programs encourage adults to pursue a degree, on their timeline and with their schedule, that will improve their life path in some way – primarily through the increased income that follows the earning of a degree. Programs range from certificates to bachelor’s degrees in subject areas ranging from nursing to business.

Sadly, Ivy League elites disdain these schools. They are somehow lesser in their eyes. They are “just” vocational schools, attended by people who don’t live in nice neighborhoods or drive Volvos.

So when the elites in the politically-appointed ranks of the Obama Education Department looked into changing loan regulations, they apparently decided to take a swipe at these “lesser” schools – and, in doing so, the group of people who attend them.

The path to change in this case is a shady regulatory maze that involves new interpretations of old Congressionally-approved language that has stood the test of time for more than 40 years. In short, there would be a significant reduction in the amount of loan money available to those students hoping to improve their lives by enrolling in private-sector schools.

Without enough funds from student loans, students will be unable to pursue the education of their choice. Over 100,000 degrees, education experts estimate, will not be earned as a result of this frankly sneaky regulatory change.

Perhaps the Obama appointees think that these students should attend different schools, perhaps public schools where the government plays a bigger role? Well, the truth is that these students will likely turn to community colleges – which are shrinking their operating budgets right now, not increasing them. To accommodate the students shut out from a private sector education, the government would have to expand public education to the tune of some $100 billion. Does anyone think the public has a thirst for that kind of additional expenditure right now?

The rationale behind this agenda item, buried in conference rooms at the end of long, cold hallways in Washington, D.C., is tough to figure out. Beyond elitism, or a belief that for-profit schools are somehow illegitimate, what reason could the regulators have for pushing down these schools?

If the Obama appointees behind this move don’t believe that private-sector schools should exist, they ought to say so. Let there be a public debate about whether private-sector schools ought to be shut down or lose their accreditation. Without a fair public debate and Congressional action, this major change in loan eligibility will go down in history as an egregious abuse of executive branch power that hurts the lives of hundreds of thousands of working people who dream of achieving something better through education. And here I thought that’s what the president wanted.

ACORN Story Grows But Mainstream Media Refuse to Cover It,"Bruce Springsteen once wrote: “From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come).” I doubt he expected that story of love gone wrong would become ideal political commentary for the group known as ACORN.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The small scandal showing an embarrassing video of Baltimore ACORN staffers looking like they were giving tax advice on how to set up a brothel, is now national news. -- This story has everything you could ever want – corruption, sleazy actions at tax-funded organizations, firings, government ties, sex, hookers. It is a network news director’s dream. Imagine the ratings!                
                

            
                Only almost no one is covering it.                 
                

            
                This is the news media in the era of Van Jones and President Obama. The major outlets cover what they want and create the themes they want. When they find something inconvenient, they let it pass. They didn’t like the Van Jones story, so they ignored it. The network news media liked the financial entity known as Fannie Mae, so they ignored that scandalous organization for years. ACORN is getting the same treatment.                
                

            
                But it isn’t working any more. The ACORN fiasco has now impacted three offices – Baltimore, Washington and New York – with laugh-out-loud videos reminiscent of the hookers and pimps from the 1970s “Starsky and Hutch” show. Huggy Bear returns! Four employees have been fired, with more likely to come. And the controversy was so laughably bad that the Census Bureau cut off all ties to the group known formally as the ""Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now."" -- They called it the “tipping point” to shed themselves of ACORN. More nuts for someone else, I guess.                
                

            
                And yet. And yet it’s still been ignored by the network news. Nothing on ABC, CBS or NBC. The only thing any one of the three broadcast networks has done appeared in a blog post by ABC’s Jake Tapper. It's hardly worth noting except to show that the networks know about what’s going on. They just don’t care to report it. Only FOX News has bothered to report on the controversy.                
                

            
                The video scandal is only part of the fiasco that is this Saul Alinsky-esque community group. Just last week CNN reported that other ACORN employees were arrested in Florida. “Arrest warrants were issued Wednesday for 11 Florida voter registration workers who are suspected of submitting false information on hundreds of voter registration cards, according to court documents,” said CNN.                
                

            
                That’s typical. The Web site ""Rotten ACORN"" is devoted to election fraud complaints against the organization. The site’s map shows 14 different states where complaints have been filed. The last time any one of the broadcast networks talked about that was before the 2008 presidential election. That was NBC on Nov. 1. Nothing since.                
                

            
                Yes, the newspapers have taken a passing glance at the video story. The Post wrote about the firings in D.C. The New York Times ran a story by the Associated Press. Nothing more. I am underwhelmed. At least the Times covered it this time. With Jones, the Times waited until he had resigned to report he was under fire.                
                

            
                What’s worse with ACORN is that we’re paying for all this. At least in part. The Washington Examiner writes that they “found that ACORN has received at least $53 million in federal money since 1994.”                
                

            
                For its own part, ACORN naturally blamed someone else. In this case, FOX News, calling itself “their Willy Horton for 2009.” The ACORN state reads like a paranoid’s interpretation of the videos. Here’s Bertha Lewis, Chief Organizer, for the group:                
                

            
                “The relentless attacks on ACORN's members, its staff and the policies and positions we promote are unprecedented. An international entertainment conglomerate, disguising itself as a ‘news’ agency (FOX), has expended millions, if not tens of millions of dollars, in their attempt to destroy the largest community organization of Black, Latino, poor and working families in the country. It is not coincidence that the most recent attacks have been launched just when health care reform is gaining traction. It is clear they've had these tapes for months.”                
                

            
                Yeah, all that about under-aged prostitution, corruption and government connections isn’t news. People are just out to get ACORN. No wonder their name symbolizes a kind of nut. Too bad the rest of the media don’t want us to know that.

"It's Not Just About Coakley, Stupid","Reuters
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                As the Massachusetts Senate race heads toward its final hours, candidate Martha Coakley has proved so far to be a state of the art gaffe machine. This is indisputable. Her campaign has been overwhelmed by repeated embarrassments.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Many will be inclined to blame Martha Coakley exclusively should she lose the Senate race in the Bay State. Some will rush to call the election an ""aberration"" caused by an inferior candidate.
Unfortunately for Democrats, blame for this Senate race does not rest entirely with Coakley. Responsibility also rests with her party.                
                

            
                The Democrats have developed a tin ear for politics, this coming only a year after Barack Obama ran one of the more brilliant campaigns in history. More than ever, Democrats are determined to pass a health care reform bill notwithstanding public sentiment.                
                

            
                According to the recent Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll, only 12% of those surveyed want President Obama to focus his attention on health care. Close to half of those questioned want him to concentrate on the economy. When it comes to Massachusetts, a Rasmussen poll revealed limited faith in the ability of tax and spend increases to improve the economy. And bear in mind that Democrat's plans for health care reform will increase both spending and taxes.                
                

            
                The Democrats appear to be ignoring the polls. Of late, they are focusing almost exclusively on health care at the expense of supporting sound economic policy. Even now, people are debating the effect this election will have on health care reform. No one is discussing the effect the Massachusetts election will have on economic policy.                
                

            
                It won’t help Democrats to argue that this election is about local and not national issues. If Coakley loses on Tuesday, it means that the power of President Obama’s personality and agenda may not extend beyond the gates of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Voters in Massachusetts may like President Obama, but maybe not enough to put his candidate in the Senate, and not enough to save his domestic priority.                
                

            
                The Democrats now need more than a win. They need a decisive Coakley victory to prove that the value of their president and agenda.

Rutgers rage against Rice -- why do liberals have so much hate for black conservatives?,"Now Playing                            Rutgers protests Condoleezza Rice as graduation speaker                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Have you heard the news?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Condoleezza Rice lacks “moral authority.” She fails to meet the standards of “exemplary citizenship” and she does not have what it takes to “inspire” graduating college seniors.                
                

            
                That crazy thinking comes from the New Brunswick Faculty Council of Rutgers University. They voted last week to ask university leadership to cancel Rice’s invitation to be this year’s Commencement Speaker and receive an honorary degree.

                Yes, apparently the first African-American woman to serve as National Security Adviser and the nation’s Secretary of State doesn’t have what it takes to be honored by Rutgers.

                Rice holds a Ph.D. in political science. She has taught college for decades. She was Provost of Stanford University. She worked her way up from a working-class family in the segregated South to the highest echelon of world power and politics.                
                

            
                But according to the Rutgers faculty council, all of that is negated by her service in President George W. Bush’s administration.                
                

            
                They cited her roles in pushing the false claim of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They also point to her support for using enhanced interrogation techniques to get information from terror suspects.                
                

            
                The facts are right. The conclusion is wrong.                
                

            
                I, too, disagreed with many of the policies Rice faithfully supported as a member of the Bush administration. But only partisan hatred can blind the faculty to her extraordinary level of accomplishment for herself and her country.                
                

            
                Rice is smart, disciplined, hard-working and the model of an inspiring modern American. She personifies the American Dream. She is living inspiration for a young person trying to accomplish great work no matter what the barriers. And in Rice’s generation there were some serious barriers starting with her race and gender.                
                

            
                That is why New Jersey Republican State Assemblywoman Mary Pat Angelini called the Rutgers faculty’s wrongheaded decision ""appalling and an embarrassment to our state.""                
                

            
                ""This is nothing more than a political firestorm fueled by their hatred of an opposing ideology, and President George W. Bush in particular. Dr. Rice and the people of New Jersey deserve better,"" Angelini said.                
                

            
                There is an added element at play here. There is a disgraceful double standard amongst liberals, particularly those in academia, in the hatred they direct at black conservatives.                
                

            
                We saw this last April when the conservative neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson was forced to step down as a Commencement Speaker for Johns Hopkins University (where he ably served as the head of pediatric neurosurgery).                
                

            
                Liberals on the Hopkins campus mobilized against Carson because he criticized President Obama’s health care reform law and said that he opposed gay marriage.                
                

            
                I am not a conservative but I have spoken out for years against the staggering amount blind hatred directed at black conservatives by liberals.                
                

            
                Liberals are shockingly quick to demean and dismiss brilliant black people like Rice, Carson, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Professor Walter E. Williams and economist Thomas Sowell because they don’t fit into the role they have carved out for a black person in America.                
                

            
                Black Americans must be obedient liberals on all things or risk being called a race traitor or an Uncle Tom.                
                

            
                I’ve experienced some of this vitriol firsthand when I have veered by liberal orthodoxy. I wrote about it in my book “Muzzled – the Assault on Honest Debate.”                
                

            
                This shunning of Rice is especially troubling coming from a great American university. This is the place where debate and dissenting views are to be valued as sacred.                
                

            
                Rutgers’s own university mission statement says that one of its goals is to produce students who perform “public service in support of the needs of the citizens of the state and its local, county, and state governments.”                
                

            
                How is the public served by muzzling one of the most thoughtful, accomplished and respected political voices of her time just because she happens to be a Republican?                
                

            
                Doe the Rutgers University faculty really have so little faith in the students they are about to graduate that they think are incapable of hearing opposing views and making up their own minds?                
                

            
                Before her commencement speech, I would like to see any of one of the members of faculty council debate Secretary Rice on foreign policy and then let their students see how well their professors’ critique holds up.                
                

            
                Hell, how about we invite the entire faculty council to take their best shot at Secretary Rice in a debate.                
                

            
                Rice is the most famous Republican woman politician in the country. She gave the best speech of the 2012 Republican National Convention and, despite her lack of interest in political office, still gets mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2016.                
                

            
                If she is truly on the fence about a White House run, I would suggest she go for it if for no other reason than to rub it in the faces of these pompous jackass professors.                
                

            
                Of course that is not the only reason she should run, but it sure would be a delightful bonus.

"SEN. MICHAEL ENZI: I'll Embrace Bipartisanship, If Obama Will, Too","When President Obama addresses the American people tonight to discuss health care, he has the opportunity to plot a course correction and put us on the path toward common sense, consensus health care reform.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I have said repeatedly that we need health care reform, but we need to get it right. The president has laid out clear goals for health care reform that Republicans strongly support. I still stand ready to work with the administration and Democrats and Republicans in Congress to enact reforms that meet those shared goals-- reducing costs, expanding coverage, improving quality, allowing Americans to keep the care they have, if they like it, and holding down the nation’s deficit and debt.                
                

            
                To achieve bipartisan reform, we have to set aside the most contentious pieces and focus on areas where we can reach agreement. I hope that when the president speaks to Congress and the country tonight, he too will focus on those areas where we agree on the goals and principles but need to work out the details. If he focuses on these provisions, which Republicans, Democrats and independents across the country could support, he will move us in the direction toward consensus on health care reform. In other words, the president should scrap the partisan bills that have already passed in Congressional committees and begin with a new, reasonable and bipartisan approach that the American people can believe in.                
                

            
                Insurance reforms would give the American people the health care security they need. Insurance companies should not be able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions and should not be allowed to drop people when they face serious illness or lose their jobs.                
                

            
                If we enact these common sense reforms, we will force insurers to compete on a level playing field on the basis of the value they provide to their enrollees, rather than their ability to game the marketplace and gain unfair advantages. This will boost meaningful competition and give people real choices. When companies have to compete for business and patients can vote with their feet, insurance companies will have to provide better value. By giving people access to more, better information about the costs and quality of health care services and health insurance options, we can let them make informed choices for their families.                
                

            
                We should allow small businesses and working families, who do not get insurance through their employer, to band together across state lines and use their combined negotiating power to negotiate more affordable, higher quality plans. We can also look at private, non-profit health insurance cooperatives, where people could join together to get lower rates and coverage. But we must keep in mind that affordable, accessible, quality health care lies in private competition not government control.                
                

            
                Republicans agree with the president that we have to pay for reform. Americans are greatly concerned with runaway deficits and they do not want to pass trillions of dollars in debt onto their children and grandchildren.                
                

            
                In the long-term, we can pay for reform by bending the cost curve and reducing total health care spending. President Obama has spoken frequently about the need to bring down costs and I could not agree more. One of the most significant, cost-saving steps we can take is to replace the fee-for-service model, which reimburses physicians based on the number of tests or treatments they administer, with a model that rewards quality, not quantity, of care.                
                

            
                We must eliminate frivolous malpractice cases, which not only drive up costs through malpractice insurance, settlements and legal fees, but also force doctors to practice defensive medicine, where they order unnecessary tests and treatments to protect themselves from getting sued. The current system of meritless lawsuits costs too much, does not fairly reward patients who have legitimate claims, and forces doctors to spend too much time in the courtroom instead of the operating room.                
                

            
                We also need to give people meaningful incentives to make healthy lifestyle choices, like eating healthy food, exercising regularly and giving up smoking. Safeway, the national grocery store chain tried this in 2005 when it offered lower health insurance premiums to employees in exchange for adopting healthy behaviors. -- While other companies have seen their health insurance costs go up by 38 percent since then, Safeway’s have remained constant. Health care reform should encourage other companies to establish innovative programs to bring down costs and help employees live healthier lives.                
                

            
                Even with these cost-cutting reforms, some people will not be able to afford the care they need. For these folks who truly need help, we should provide reasonable financial assistance to help them purchase health insurance and get the care they and their children need.                
                

            
                Most members of Congress, and most of the American people, would likely support these common sense proposals. If the president can set aside the polarizing issues and focus on bringing people together, he can help us take significant steps toward our shared goal-- helping more Americans get the quality, affordable health care coverage that they need and deserve.

"Barack Obama -- One Man, Two Narratives","It is no secret that conservatives aren’t enamored with the state of things in the age of Obama. But while the conservative base marshals against the president’s policies, many liberals are also not ecstatic about what they have seen so far from the president so far, either.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                How could this possibly be? Because to date, the Obama presidency is a tale of two narratives.                
                

            
                The conservative narrative sees our nation's leader as a man from the ideological left who wants to make America more like a European social democracy.                
                

            
                As evidence, conservatives point to the recently passed health care bill, which is viewed as a government takeover which was rammed through Congress with the use of unsavory backroom deals. On top of health care, conservatives highlight the government takeover of Chrysler and General Motors and the more recent government takeover of the student loan industry as signs of increasing government interference in the private sector. And, finally, no conservative can forget the gigantic $787 billion stimulus package that hasn’t stimulated anything other than the rapidly growing national debt.                
                

            
                On the foreign affairs front, the conservative narrative on Obama does not improve. Conservatives view him as an appeaser, a weakling, or worse. Visually, this viewpoint is solidified by Obama’s unfortunate habit of bowing to world leaders and a photograph of a smiling Obama and Hugo Chavez shaking hands at a Latin American conference in April 2009.                
                

            
                But conservative disdain for Obama’s foreign policy is hardly just limited to a single image. The president’s support of Hugo Chavez’s man in Honduras during the Central American country’s constitutional crisis and Obama's annoying habit of apologizing for American behavior while in foreign locales also riles conservatives.                
                

            
                Conservatives were infuriated by Obama’s failure to boldly stand up for pro-democracy Iranians protesting in the streets of Tehran after the corrupt June 2009 Iranian election. They also resent his inability to somehow persuade the Iranian theocracy to give up its nuclear program. While the president plays soft with America's enemies, conservatives say, he has presided over a cooling of relations with traditional American allies like Israel and Great Britain.                
                

            
                When it comes regard to homeland security, conservatives are outraged by the Obama administration’s pledge to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention facilities and his Justice Department’s attempt to try some of the worst terrorists, like 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, in civilian courts rather than military tribunals.                
                

            
                In sum, many conservatives conclude that President Obama is Jimmy Carter II, or worse.                
                

            
                But if this narrative is correct and Obama really IS the reincarnation of a more radical Carter, why hasn’t he attracted enthusiastic praise from liberals?                
                

            
                Enter Narrative 2.                
                

            
                The liberal narrative sees President Obama as a progressive disappointment. He has let down the ideologues who voted for him by backing the policies they staunchly oppose and not fighting harder to pass policies they desperately want.                
                

            
                Sure, the president pushed through health care reform, but it wasn’t real reform, they argue. Obama gave up the public option  too easily and he never even tried to sell single payer health care to the American people.                
                

            
                The president may have signed a huge stimulus bill into law, but to many on the left, the stimulus wasn’t nearly significant enough. And though Obama vowed to fight global warming while he was on the campaign trail, nothing meaningful has been done as we, from their point of view,  apparently race toward extinction. The president has even opened up more of America’s coastline to offshore drilling.                
                

            
                Like conservatives, liberals also find little to cheer for in Obama’s homeland security policies. While the president promised he would close down Gitmo, it has been over a year and we don’t seem to be any closer shutting it down than when Obama first took office. Though the president has made a few cosmetic changes to America’s anti-terrorism policies, he has, with a few crucial exceptions, adopted the Bush anti-terrorism plan, which he once staunchly campaigned against.                
                

            
                In the most disturbing chapter of the liberal narrative, Obama more than doubled the number of American troops in Afghanistan. He has not only continued to utilize unmanned drones against terrorist targets around the world, but he has authorized more drone attacks than George Bush did over the course of his entire presidency. Obama has even upped the ante by approving the extrajudicial targeting of an American citizen, the Al Qaeda connected Imam Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.                
                

            
                To the left, these policies are anathema to what progressives believe is just and moral. It is little wonder that subscribers to the liberal Obama narrative find the idea that our president is a socialist and a peacenik laughable.                
                

            
                So how does one square the circle? Some of the president’s supporters like to suggest that the competing narratives are proof that Obama is a pragmatic moderate without any entrenched ideology. This is hard to swallow.                
                

            
                In the end, we are forced to conclude that more than one year into the age of Obama, the president remains, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, “a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.”

                The easiest part of the Affordable Care Act was supposed to be designing a user-friendly website that prompted millions to sign up for health insurance with just few clicks. To describe the launch as a colossal fiasco is putting it mildly.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                While many feel slighted with a “glitchy” website, the Latino community has been utterly dismissed. That’s because if you speak only Spanish, the Administration didn’t even bother to fully rollout an ObamaCare website for you. Yet, something tells me they won’t have any difficulties sending us the penalty notice for not signing up – in Spanish.

                Still, while much attention is currently being focused on the mutilation of a website, those of us who mistrust Washington’s growing control and power are most distressed about the damage Obamacare’s full implementation will do to the nation’s healthcare system.                
                

            
                President Obama promised that his health reform plan would lower health costs, expand choice, and improve quality of care. Yet, as the program is unveiled – piece by broken piece – none of these promises are materializing. Americans are losing full-time employment, millions have been dropped from their employer insurance rolls, and many doctors won’t participate.                
                

            
                And worst of all, the care is not affordable. While a Bronze Plan – the cheapest insurance available under the ACA – will cost many families more than they are currently paying, they will have to cover 40 percent of their medical bills out of pocket through deductibles and co-payments — up to as much as $12,700 per year for a family. Consider also that 65 percent of Hispanics are millennials, meaning they will pay much more for a product they don’t need, didn’t ask for and cannot afford.

                But it’s not enough to cite the flaws with the law; conservatives should offer something better, now, while we are still at a crossroads. To that end, real reform should build on the best of the current system, and go back to the “American way” of doing things. Medical care must put the customer first, and allow government a limited role.                
                

            
                In replacing the president’s health law, Republicans and Democrats should work together on reforms that focus on three main principles: Empowering the individual consumer, encouraging a competitive marketplace, and providing for the truly needy.                
                

            
                Empower the Individual Consumers                
                

            
                True reform should empower individuals to make their own choices – not limit options and mandate participation. Expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) is a good first step. HSAs provide tax breaks to help people afford medical care, and to empower them to make their own health care choices – instead of leaving governments or employers in charge. They also restore market incentives to control costs, through competition.                
                

            
                Congress should also consider personal tax credits for buying health insurance. Right now employers get a tax break if they offer care to their workers. Why not allow ordinary Americans to take this credit if they choose — so that they can purchase care if they are not satisfied with what their company may offer? Unlike the president’s health care law, this would build on the current system, while creating new options for those who want something different.                
                

            
                Encourage a Competitive Marketplace                
                

            
                Overregulation stifles the market’s ability to provide innovative options, and arbitrary regulation leaves many with unmet demands. For example, right now, people may only buy insurance that meets the mandates set in their state of residence. This can make it extremely expensive for people in states with heavy regulations that protect powerful interest groups. We don’t prevent people from going out-of-state to buy a car, or home appliances, or higher education. Why should insurance be any different?                
                

            
                Tort reform must also be part of health care reform. Lawsuit abuse drives up the cost of health care, and doctors ultimately pass on the cost of frivolous litigation to their patients. Traditional tort standards for medical liability should be strictly enforced. Non-economic damages, such as compensation for pain and suffering should be limited and punitive damages should apply only in criminal proceedings. These reforms would ensure fair compensation for those hurt by doctors without inflating costs.                
                

            
                In theory, health insurance exchanges expand choice and encourage competition. The Affordable Care Act, however, eliminates these positive effects by requiring all plans sold in exchanges to meet the same federal guidelines. Private exchanges allow trade associations, civic groups, and businesses of all sizes to offer their employees and members a wide range of alternatives.                
                

            
                Provide for the Truly Needy                
                

            
                There is a role for government in health care reform, but it should be limited to providing a safety net for the truly needy. On the state-level, high-risk pools for the uninsured should be expanded. It’s important that health care reform help those who are currently unable to afford insurance. One way to do that – without hurting the tens of millions who are happy with their health care – is through the expansion of high-risk pools. Most states have these already. They provide coverage for those who cannot obtain insurance because of their health conditions, subsidizing the cost of policies through a tax on insurance companies or by general tax revenues. This is a better approach than forcing these individuals into the regular market and increasing costs for others.                
                

            
                Lastly, it is essential that reform protects Medicare beneficiaries and improves Medicaid. Right now seniors have few options under Medicare, whose funding has been slashed to pay for the Affordable Care Act. Medicaid is even worse. The program is driving up the federal deficit, and offering extremely limited care with outcomes that are no better than going without insurance. It is shameful that low-income Americans are locked into this failing program.                
                

            
                Ultimately, if we are to be a thriving and healthy society we must still be that country where entrepreneurs compete by constantly improving customer service, charging competitive prices, and innovating in order to achieve the trust and loyalty of their customer base. Putting government regulators in charge leaves too many Americans behind — including those who speak Spanish, and the millions who are losing their policies. We need a better approach.

A Doctor's Prognosis for Obamacare -- The Four Essential Problems With the Patient,"This week Dr. Howard Dean, an internist by training and the former head of the Democratic National Committee, went on the record in an appearance on cable TV and predicted that the mandate in the new health care law that requires everyone to carry health insurance would be dropped, either because it will be ruled unconstitutional or because people are just uncomfortable being told what to do.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As a practicing physician, I couldn't agree more. The mandate is one essential problem with the health care reform law.                 
                

            
                A second problem is the lack of attention to the growing doctor shortage. Many of us who are practicing medicine in the current climate are not happy with third party payers of any kind, public or private, and we are dropping out of insurance, and beginning to band together to protest.                  
                

            
                A third mistake is perpetuating the myth that hospital emergency rooms will no longer carry as large a burden when everyone has insurance.                 
                

            
                A fourth oversight is not considering how advancing technologies, which are expensive, targeted, and personalized, are going to be covered by a one-size-fits all insurance model that has no disincentive for overuse and so can only control premiums by denying services.                
                

            
                The biggest problem with Obamacare is that it is not about health care, it is all about health insurance.                 
                

            
                Dean is right when he says that people are balking at the concept of being forced to carry health insurance, which doesn't guarantee you health care.                 
                

            
                Lawsuits are underway in Virginia, Florida, and several other states that will test the constitutionality of the new law.                 
                

            
                Last week, 71% of voters in Missouri supported Proposition C, which would establish a state law that people wouldn't be compelled to pay a penalty if they failed to have health insurance. Similar resolutions are expected soon in Arizona and Oklahoma.                
                

            
                Focusing on whether the new health reform law is actually constitutional or not is not as central from a medical point of view as the question of what constitutes health care itself. Obamacare doesn't address that crucial question.                 
                

            
                If, for example, the U.S. government demonstrates an obligation to protect American society by mandating a certain vaccine and then providing it, I and other doctors would have less of an objection than if it insists that all my patients buy an insurance that doesn't guarantee them access to health care. Why should patients be obligated to buy insurance by a federal government that won't even mandate that insurance must be portable across state lines? Portability of insurance would have helped my patients more than a law that mandates that we all carry an insurance which must be purchased at the state exchanges.                
                

            
                If the U.S. government feels a responsibility to provide a rudimentary form of health care for all, the only honest way to do that would be to train and hire the doctors to administer the care and build sufficient facilities for it to be delivered in. Anything else is a cheat on the American people.                
                

            
                Mandating health insurance is not only questionable legally, it is also questionable medically. It sets up an unsustainable tautology that assumes willing participation on the part of doctors. But many of the doctors I know will drop out, even if their patients can't.

"Why Is NOW So Afraid of a Pro-Life, Pro-Family Ad?","What is the National Organization for Women afraid of? Apparently a touching story about a courageous woman who chooses life in the face of adversity is just too much to take. And when her football star son decides to share that story on Super Bowl Sunday, well, that goes too far. It’s “divisive.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                NOW and its affiliate organizations the Feminist Majority and Women’s Media Center are condemning the Super Bowl advertisement featuring Tim Tebow and his mother Pam, calling it an offensive “anti-choice” ad.                
                

            
                Could you imagine anything more ironic? The organization that purports to embrace women and “choice” is desperately clamoring to shut down the most loving choice of all: the choice for life. Yet the women of NOW can’t abide 30 seconds of a heart-warming story. What would producers at Lifetime Television say?                
                

            
                Let’s be real. What’s the worst case scenario here? That if Americans hear this message they will choose to make sacrifices in order to have a child and bring a wonderful life in to the world? That’s hardly an abhorrent message.                
                

            
                These groups are not “for” women and they don’t want them to have a “choice.” They only want women to “choose” the path of abortion. Never mind that abortion has been shown over and over to be destructive in numerous ways, both physically and psychologically. But, *please* don’t tell people that there are alternatives.                
                

            
                In their efforts to cling to the old feminist mantra that we somehow “need” abortion, NOW sells American women short. They assume that women are so weak-brained and easily manipulated that they must be protected from a life-affirming message.                
                

            
                This fracas over the Super Bowl illustrates perfectly how NOW & Co. are losing their grip as their pro-abortion position sinks in public opinion. For the first time in decades, Gallup recently reported that a majority of Americans now consider themselves pro-life. The demand by pro-life Americans, and the members of Congress who represent them, insisting that the health care reform package must not include federal funding of abortions has damaged the prospects of getting the health care reform plan through Congress. The March for Life in Washington last Friday was one of the biggest ever attended with tens of thousands of seniors, young people and Americans of every race and creed taking a stand in defense of life.                
                

            
                It is this growing American pro-life majority that has driven NOW to desperation. In an effort to remain relevant, they apparently have become experts at sports. In their words, the purpose of the Super Bowl is to “bring people together.” I’m not sure if you asked Sedrick Ellis of the Saints or Gary Brackett of the Colts if that was their mission that they’d agree. Two teams fighting to the last second to be named Super Bowl champion is a divisive event within itself. If you have any doubts, just ask the fans.                
                

            
                What is divisive are NOW’s attempts to demonize the Tebow family, CBS, and ad sponsor Focus on the Family. In a desperate attempt to keep full information from women, they are attacking the family of an American sports hero with the courage to live out his convictions.
As a mother of five, I can only say I’d much rather have my children watch the Tebow story than the hundreds of other things they might see during the Super Bowl. Somehow I think the majority of American sports fans, women and men alike, will be able to appreciate the blessings of life expressed by the Tebow family. If this beautiful story of family unity, sacrifice and triumph is too harsh on the eyes and ears for so-called women’s groups, I have two words of advice: mute button.

	Marjorie Dannenfelser is the president and an original organizer of the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List), a national pro-life group dedicated to pursuing policies and electing candidates to reduce and ultimately end abortion. Under Marjorie’s leadership, the SBA List has grown to more than 365,000 members nationwide. Since its founding, the SBA List has helped elect more than 100 pro-life candidates to the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 to the U.S. Senate, and 16 to other statewide offices across the country."
The Reconciliation Option -- Don't Do It Democrats,"On Monday morning, in advance of this week's bipartisan health care summit, President Obama posted a new plan for reform on the White House Web site. It closely resembles the Senate bill that passed in December.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                On a conference call with reporters, White House staffers told them that if Republicans refuse to cooperate with the Democrats, the president will urge Congress to move forward with the bill through the budget “reconciliation” process. This would allow lawmakers to pass the measure with just 51 votes, effectively bypassing a Republican filibuster. Many Democrats are clamoring to employ reconciliation regardless of Republican participation.                
                

            
                Passing a comprehensive health care bill via reconciliation is a bad idea. It represents just the sort of hyper-partisan policymaking Americans don't want. Democrats would be setting themselves up for big losses in November.                
                

            
                Last year, voter discontent over partisanship led to Republican victories in Virginia, and New Jersey. This year it created the upset victory for Scott Brown in Massachusetts. In 2010, at least eight seats in the Senate are up for grabs, as well as around 30 in the House. The momentum is already moving in the Republicans' direction, so that number is likely to swell as time goes in.                
                

            
                If the Democrats pass health care reform with a party-line vote, a betting man would have to give pretty good odds that the Republicans will win many of those seats. The existing bills need to be scrapped. Democrats need to start over with a fresh bill, and embrace ideas that have broad-based support.                
                

            
                That’s what Americans want. A recent Rasmussen poll found that fully 58 percent of voters disapprove of the existing health care bills -- and 61 percent want Congress to start over on reform. Plus, there are a number of substantive proposals that would bring down costs and expand coverage while attracting widespread support from both parties.                
                

            
                Consider insurance reform. Prohibiting insurers from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions is a reform that's long overdue. This proposal is included in the president's proposal, and it's popular with voters of all political stripes. Indeed, it could act as the centerpiece of a bipartisan bill.                
                

            
                But more can be done with existing insurance regulations.                
                

            
                For example, lawmakers should allow consumers to purchase health insurance plans across state line. Doing so would inject some desperately needed competition into the health care market. Insurers would face new pressure to attract patients, leading to lower prices and more choices.
A bipartisan bill should also take cost control seriously.                
                

            
                Here, there’s bipartisan agreement on the importance of health information technology. Too many hospitals still use paper records, leading to delays and subpar treatment. Instituting a modern, tech-savvy electronic records system could eliminate a lot of inefficiency. About 75 percent of the American public already wants health care providers to use electronic records, according a Kaiser Family Foundation poll.                
                

            
                Lawmakers could also trim health care costs through comparative effectiveness research, which compares different medicines to determine which ones work best. Of course, it's crucial that Americans have access to the best drugs and treatments. But money is sometimes wasted on expensive new medicines that don't deliver better results. Medical professionals should be better able to determine which treatments are worth the price.                
                

            
                Lawmakers might also consider malpractice reform. President Obama praised it in his State of the Union. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it “a good starting point” during his speech at this month’s Conservative Political Action Conference.                
                

            
                And from a policy perspective, it makes sense. Every year, one in eight physicians is sued – yet they're cleared of guilt over 90 percent of the time. The fear of malpractice suits drives doctors to practice defensive medicine, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments. This behavior costs an estimated $124 billion annually in additional health care spending.                
                

            
                Americans appreciate these costs. Nearly two-thirds support imposing caps on tort payouts.                
                

            
                Democrats need to start over with health care reform, and embrace ideas that can garner support on both sides of the aisle – like malpractice reform, eliminating denials of insurance coverage based on pre-existing conditions, cost control, and electronic record-keeping.                
                

            
                Some Democrats will surely think that such a strategy is simply capitulating to the Republicans. The opposite is true, though. Back in 1996, when President Bill Clinton moved forward with tax, spending, and welfare reform, he seized some political ground and successfully demonized Speaker Newt Gingrich.                
                

            
                So long as President Obama gives up the threat of reconciliation, he still has a chance of passing reform and helping his Party hold on to both chambers of Congress. The White House Summit is a great opportunity to start this discussion. Americans want Washington to act on health care. They just don't want a partisan bill.

GLENN BECK: Here's What I Want to Know...,"As I watch the news everyday, the math just isn't adding up. Back in May, President Obama said the U.S. debt load was ""unsustainable."" Yet here we are a few months later with proposed government health care and cap-and-trade legislation, which would only add trillions of dollars to the existing problem. We were promised an open debate on health care and it's happened behind closed doors. Politicians are asked to read bills before they vote on them, and react by calling the less agreeable 'the mob.' There is too much at stake for Americans to be left in the dark. I don't want you to wake up one day and say 'whoa, when did we do that'? That's why I'm spending this week asking as many questions as possible. We may end up with more questions than answers -- but we will be heard. Question with boldness, speak without fear, and hold to the truth -- no matter what answer you find. Here are a few of the questions we are looking into this week:                                            ADVERTISEMENT

  If politicians aren't writing the bills and aren't reading the bills, do they have any idea what these 1,000-page plus bills actually impose on the American people?
  If the ""public option"" health care plan is so good, why won't politicians agree to have that as their plan?
  If town hall meetings are intended for the politicians to learn what's on our mind, why do they spend so much time talking instead of listening?
  Politicians are refusing to attend town hall meetings complaining, without evidence, that they are scripted. Does that mean we shouldn't come out and vote for you since every campaign stop, baby kiss and speech you give is scripted?

The Time Is Now for Health Care Reform,"As I was watching the vote from the Senate Gallery at the crack of dawn Tuesday morning it became clear to me that this health care bill needs to pass. Republicans are carping about voting on Christmas Eve. Fortunately they decided not to hold the Senate in session until late in the evening.

The GOP has painted it as the Democrats ""ramming"" through health care. Senator Tom Coburn said "" What the American people ought to pray is that somebody can't make the vote tonight. That's what they ought to pray."" With Senator Byrd ailing, the Democrats are not taking any chances and are still wooing some possible Republicans. Senator Olympia Snowe met with President Obama recently and is still working with the Democrats but the pressure from her own party to vote health care down is enormous.

I am one of the people who believe that health care is a right and not a privilege. I believe that the only way Americans can compete on the world market is to offer what other Westernized countries offer; free and accessible health care. Even if you disagree with me, however, there is no doubt that we need changes and we need them fast. Senator Tom Harkin pointed out that we spend twice as much as the European's countries spend health care but have poorer results because of the lack of preventative health care.

In his time on the floor Senator Harkin pointed out that the bill has provisions for seniors to have annual wellness visits and that it includes provisions for education on nutrition and smoking cessation. Those prevention measures save tons of money. A recent study on smoking cessation in Massachusetts found that in just two and a half years there was 26% drop in tobacco usage. The drop in tobacco usage showed up in 38% less hospitalizations for heart attacks, and 18% fewer ER visits and 12% fewer claims for adverse conditions from pregnancy. -- That’s an amazing result from just one type of prevention initiative.

For the prevention programs, the money that can be saved and the quality of human lives the bill has promise. It is not perfect legislation and it should have some kind of public option. There are earmarks and giveaways but legislators of all stripes wait till their vote is needed and then take care of the folks back home. That tactic has been going on for eons. This time is no exception. The old adage still applies -- don’t watch how laws and sausage are made -- and this bill is no exception to the rule. As Senator Harkin said this bill is a ""starter home"" and not a mansion. If you don’t have a home then it is great to get a roof over your head. This is a flawed first attempt but it is a roof to provide at least minimum shelter and outside of Medicare passed in 1965 and the legislation that created HMO’s there has been nothing really new in health care delivery. The time is now and the Democrats are seizing it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT

Time for Dems to Relearn the Lost Art of Compromise,"Compromise seems to be a lost art in Washington these days. For the Democrats to regain the momentum they had in their Party when they won majorities across the board, they will need to learn how to do so quickly, especially on fiscal issues.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                With a majority of the president’s bipartisan deficit commission voting to support its report on cutting the deficit, and with the White House and the Republicans heading towards an agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts, it is clear that fiscal issues are now at the forefront of our nation’s focus.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, many Democrats are unwilling to budge on key issues that require meeting in the middle. --President Obama continues to face pressure from the left to oppose deficit-reducing cuts to programs like Medicare and Social Security similar to those outlined by the commission, and is angering the left for attempts to find compromise in extending the Bush tax cuts.                
                

            
                Polling from before and after the election shows if the Democrats wish to resuscitate their party, these are exactly the type of compromises they need to be making.                
                

            
                An examination of the data shows that voters want change from the Democrats’ taxing and spending policies of the last two years, and they want the Democrats and Republicans to work together to reduce spending and cut the deficit.                
                

            
                According to a Pew Research Center study conducted last month, a plurality (46%) say the major reason they opposed a candidate is because he or she supported Obama’s economic policies, and 42% say they opposed a candidate because he or she supported Obama’s general agenda.                
                

            
                Just like the elections in 2006 and 2008 were referendums against George Bush and the Republicans, the historic defeat the Democrats suffered in 2010 is an equally strong vote against the Democratic policies that have been implemented over the past two years.                
                

            
                However, opposition to Democratic policies does not mean that voters have embraced the Republican Party.                
                

            
                Forty-eight percent say they are happy that the Republican Party won control of the House, while 34% are unhappy. This is notably lower than the 60% who were happy when the Democrats won control of Congress in 2006, and the 57% who were happy when the GOP won control of Congress in 1994.                
                

            
                Although the American electorate clearly calls out for change, compromise and conciliation between the parties, they also recognize it does not appear likely.                 
                

            
                They are pessimistic that progress will be made under the new Congress, and expect conflict and chaos rather than results. They say relations between the two parties will get worse rather than better, 28% to 22%. Almost half (48%) say they will stay the same.                
                

            
                Further, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted last month shows that 68% of those who voted said they were ""hoping to change some things over the next two years,” but 42% expect ""just some change"" as a result of the election. Worse, about three-quarters believe that the country is in for a period of political division in which little willingness to compromise will be shown.                
                

            
                Despite high levels of pessimism, Americans want bipartisanship and compromise. They want Obama and the Democrats to work with Republicans, and they want the new Republican leaders to work with Obama and the Democrats.                
                

            
                What kind of agenda do Americans want? They want a bipartisan, centrist, pro-growth agenda that emphasizes fiscal prudence and discipline while stimulating the economy and creating private sector jobs.                
                

            
                They want to focus on balancing the budget, reducing the deficit and the debt, reforming entitlements, and cutting spending across the board, even in the defense budget.                
                

            
                In polling I conducted last month, almost half (47%) say that federal spending should be cut by 20%. Thirty-six percent say federal spending should be cut by at least five percent. Just 10% say there should be no cuts in federal spending.                
                

            
                When asked what area of federal spending should be cut first, voters say defense. A plurality of voters (29%) say they would reduce national security spending in order to cut government spending, while one-quarter says they would reduce health care, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll taken right before the election.                
                

            
                Further, voters want the tax cuts passed during the Bush administration extended, as close to two-thirds (64%) approve of extending the cuts in some form, while 28% say all the tax cuts should be repealed.                
                

            
                Additionally, voters want to stimulate the economy through fiscal stimulus initiatives that target the private sector and encourage entrepreneurship and job creation. They are seeking a rational energy policy that promotes energy independence through offshore drilling and incentives for greater development of nuclear power, while encouraging conservation by requiring utilities to produce more energy from renewable sources.                
                

            
                They want to hear practical ideas for education reform and health care reform, such as a coordinated effort at the federal and state levels to improve our science education at all levels of schooling, and investments in medical innovation and health insurance exchanges.
Thus, voters have provided a clear road map for the Democrats going forward, which begins with extending the Bush tax cuts and reducing the deficit. President Obama and the Democrats must move to the center and work with the Republicans to adopt pro-growth policies that emphasize fiscal constraint if they are to revive their party and win back some support they have lost over the past two years.

Barack Obama's Remarkable First Year,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                None of Barack Obama’s predecessors ever began his first year in office with his country, indeed the world, mired in an economic meltdown of unprecedented magnitude (with asset loses far greater than those seen during the Great Depression) and not only that, accompanied by not one but two major wars involving hundreds of thousands of U.S. forces in both theaters. To these burdens, add the inheritance of the first trillion dollar plus annual budget deficit, frozen credit markets, record home foreclosures, and a badly tarnished American reputation abroad.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As we come to the end of Barack Obama’s first year in office and the staggering challenges he has confronted (virtually all successfully) however, we find half the American public displaying, at an unprecedented level, the short attention span that is a uniquely American trait. It is the Rip Van Winkle syndrome in the extreme.                
                

            
                Millions of Americans awoke in the summer of 2009 (apparently after sleeping through the many catastrophic events of the winter) to the anti-Obama chants of tea party extremists and right-wing radio and television hosts practicing their tedious demagoguery. Republicans on Capitol Hill were doing their best impressions of Joe McCarthy, Father Coughlin and Jesse Helms, and moneyed special interests (banks and big corporations especially) at full whine.                
                

            
                Yet among this crowd of whimpering, hand-ringing, self-righteous wimps blasting the president in the summer of 2009 were many of the very people who went to President Obama during the winter begging him to bail out mega banks on the verge of implosion. These folks included the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the U.S. Bankers Association, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of America and their various Republican supporters on the Hill.                
                

            
                Now, one year later many of these same folks are among President Obama’s detractors today. But they were the same people who insisted, in the winter of 2009, that the president stem the mounting home foreclosure nightmare (virtually every GOP and Democratic member in the House and Senate begged him to do that), by pledging trillions in taxpayer guarantees for Fannie and Freddie. The Chamber of Commerce, (they were especially whiny in the winter and obnoxious in the summer and fall) and the United Auto Workers Union demanded that the government intervene to save the mismanaged GM and Chrysler auto behemoths.                
                

            
                And of course, every interest group, union, business association and elected representative begged President Obama to get the economy moving again and put people back to work. This was a bipartisan demand that included both parties on Capitol Hill, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL/CIO, minority groups, majority groups, right-wingers and left-wingers. President Obama and the Democratic Congressional leadership acted swiftly and by the end of February passed the largest ($787 billion) stimulus bill in the nation’s history.                
                

            
                Passage of the stimulus required political courage since the price tag would add to an already staggering national debt accumulated by the Bush administration over the past decade. In the Senate, every Democrat and three lonely Republican Senators voted for the stimulus. In the House the vast majority of Democrats voted for the bill, not ONE SINGLE REPUBLICAN supported the stimulus.                
                

            
                Funny how those Republican opponents of the stimulus plan reacted when projects from the plan were begun in their states or districts. The same gutless Republicans who voted against the stimulus package rushed before local cameras to take credit for delivering the federal money. – That’s real courage right there.                
                

            
                Then there was health care reform. For a hundred years the insurance companies profited mightily from predatory and discriminatory health practices by denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions, dropping people from their insurance when they became acutely ill, not to mention 40 million Americans (not illegal immigrants) who had no health care at all. President Obama and Congressional Democrats acted again and, until the Massachusetts special election, were on the verge of final passage of the most extensive overhaul of our health care system ever. ONCE AGAIN, WITHOUT A SINGLE REPUBLICAN VOTE.                
                

            
                Lost amid the sound of misguided discontent fomented by the right wing were the other significant legislative accomplishments of the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats. We’ve seen new laws to protect consumers against credit card company abuses that have cost consumers billions of dollars in the past; we’ve seen new laws protecting women in the workplace; extension of health care coverage for millions of poor children, and much, much more.                
                

            
                So for those of you in the Rip Van Winkle family who apparently (or conveniently) forgot the horrors confronting President Obama when he took office and have listened to the right wing propagandists at their full throated worst last summer and fall I offer you an observation:                
                

            
                When historians, years from now, look back on the first year of the Obama administration they will report he brought the U.S. and the world economy back from the brink of another Great Depression. He began the end of one war and took the fight to the terrorists at unprecedented levels in the other. He worked to reform a dysfunctional health care system, and he protected consumers in myriad ways. In short, I believe historians will record Mr. Obama as among the most consequential presidents of the past 100 years.

Obama Damages His Game-Changing Brand,"Politically, Barack Obama managed to pull something off with health care reform that no one had been able to do thus far. This is an achievement.

Unfortunately, it is a brand-damaging achievement. To push through this landmark legislation, the president had to align himself so closely to the Democrats that his image as an outside “change bringer” is virtually ruined.

Fact is, Obama has now cast his lot with the Democratic old guard, and the Republicans are now positioned as the hardened opposition. Forget all about bipartisanship. Even if it were possible before, that window has closed now. (With their talk of repealing the legislation, the Republicans are signaling that they risk becoming the party of “no,” which isn’t good for them either — but it’s easier to fix than Obama’s problem.)

From a marketing perspective, the fundamental problem for the president is that by turning to the old guard Democrats, he has turned his back on significant segments of his Target Market. Fiscally conservative Independents and Democrats, as well as the many crossover Republicans who voted him into office, are not seeing the man they voted for occupying the presidency. They’re not seeing Candidate Obama in President Obama. This is political bait-and-switch, and it alienates a wide swath of those who were supporters of Candidate Obama.

Bottom line, the die has been cast. Obama and the Democrats are joined at the hip. What’s next?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                President Obama needs to put the pedal to the metal if he wants to have a chance of re-election in 2012. This means that he might as well start pushing every piece of partisan legislation he can, because he won’t be getting his reputation as a new kind of politician back anytime soon. He can only hope that the legislation he passes (Wall Street regulation, immigration, etc.) works and makes those Target Markets he’s done such a good job of alienating happy again.

And, remember, things are always easier when you keep marketing and branding in mind.

How Should Republicans Handle the Health Care Summit?,"Two weeks from tomorrow the great Health Care Reform Summit will take place at the White House -- that is if the city has dug its way out of the 4 feet of snow that's shut everything down. Washington is all abuzz about the meeting with politicos asking, what does it all mean? What is the president really up to? Will the Republicans show? Which party does this benefit? Does anyone really think that this is going to lead to a bipartisan bill that can pass both houses of Congress? And who will win in the end?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Meanwhile, most Americans in the Northeast are shoveling their driveways, making up games for their kids to play indoors, and getting ready to cheer for their favorite athletes in Vancouver.                 
                

            
                Most Americans are convinced -- and grateful -- that the health care bill, as it’s been crafted is dead. They don't see how the bill can be revived and they don't think the Democrats are foolish enough to try to ram it through using obscure Senate rules.                
                

            
                But the summit will happen and it'll be on C-Span and it gives all of us something to talk about.
The posturing before the event is already underway, and I wonder if the White House, and the process, would have been better served if they had not announced the meeting and had just invited in key GOP members in for a meeting without telling the press. -- Remember, it's not that the public was upset about a lack of transparency when it came to meetings with Republicans (since there weren't any), it was that they didn't like the back-room deals struck to buy votes from the Senators from Louisiana and Nebraska. And let’s not forget, the straw that broke the camel's back was the secret meeting with the unions that kept them out of tax increases at the expense of everyone else.                
                

            
                So a private meeting could have provided an environment where members didn't feel like they'd be ridiculed or stabbed in the back for making a comment about how to improve America's health care system. They all would have been more relaxed and a path forward might have been cleared.                
                

            
                Instead, now you'll have some members of Congress who will peacock around -- there's just no getting around it -- for the cameras. They've got races to win back home, people! And while some need to tack to the left or the right to win their primaries, their constituents are more centrist. Although some might have good ideas to share they might clam up and decide to take a pass and save their comments for a moment when the cameras have stopped rolling.                
                

            
                And for the Americans who might consider tuning in to the gathering that day, the coverage leading up to the meeting will likely convince them this is just a show, that there's nothing real that will come out of the meeting and they'll just change the channel and shake their heads at the whole thing once again.                
                

            
                So, what's a Republican member to do in the time leading up to and at the meeting?                
                

            
                First, he or she should consider this a big win. They fought on the merits all of last year about making the case for their commonsense solutions - letting people take their health insurance with them if they change jobs, alleviating discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions, curbing medical malpractice reform, and encouraging competition across state lines - but they could barely get a word in edgewise, as it's always going to be the president that can lead the news.                
                

            
                Next, they should be of calm purpose. They don't need to put on any shows or be too dramatic at the summit. Listen politely, make the case for the solutions the GOP believes would help solve the problem, and don't let themselves get caught rolling their eyes or yawning because given the way things are today, that'll be more interesting to the media than any substance that's being debated.                
                

            
                Finally, as unreasonable as it is for the president to think the bill can be tinkered with and then embraced with bipartisan support, it's unreasonable for Republicans to expect them just to throw their product out the window. But take heart -- most Americans know the current bill is not fixable, and that's why they think this whole thing is over. And that's why they're much more likely to be watching the final race for the gold instead of D.C.'s race for reform.

The 500-Pound Wild Gorilla,"The first President Bush, in that time-honored tradition dating back to the beginning of time, or at least to the very first political campaign, told us quite emphatically to “read my lips: no new taxes.” Well, we didn’t need to take any special course in lip reading to know that his promise was an empty one.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Then along came his son George W. Bush, who did indeed reduce taxes for some people. But even those reductions came with a price: they were temporary and, as we have been hearing and reading ad nauseam for the months and months, they are set to expire at year’s end.                
                

            
                To demonstrate that the promise of tax reduction – or at least the absence of any tax increases – transcends political parties, President Obama vowed in his campaign not to raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 annually. Yet, we are already starting to see this promise fall by the wayside, with an increase in the tobacco tax (indeed, there are those in the middle class and working poor who do smoke), not to mention the numerous tax provisions legislated under the health care reform bill, such as a new tanning tax and the penalties for those who fail to purchase adequate health insurance.                
                

            
                The fact is that the promises made of no new taxes – or tax increases – by any individual running for office are as naked as we are during a Transportation Security Administration body scan at our local airport.                 
                

            
                Indeed, the complicated issue of taxes is like a wild 500-pound gorilla for our politicians. There are so many rules, regulations and interpretations that impact one’s final tax result, it is literally impossible for any politician to ever guarantee your taxes will not be raised.

Consider that in 2005, the Tax Foundation determined the Internal Revenue Code contained 2,139,000 words. If one were to include the Treasury Regulations that interpret the Code, there are over 9,097,000 words, all of which in one way or another attempt to determine federal tax liability. And this does not include the countless other administrative and judicial interpretations from the IRS and our courts, respectively.                 
                

            
                Is it any wonder that Albert Einstein once stated, “The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.”

Imagine for a moment, your gross income at the end of the year being fed into a highly complex machine with millions of levers, switches, buttons, dials, throttles and gears; and depending on which switch is thrown, which lever is pulled, the end result of your tax exposure differs. Well, that pretty much sums up every American’s varying annual federal tax bill.

The tax rules are littered like an overflowing back-alley dumpster with numerous provisions which may come around to bite the tax return filled out by an unsuspecting taxpayer.                 
                

            
                Here are just some of a few among the many:                 
                

            
                - The adjusted gross income (AGI) includes floors and ceilings for certain itemized deductions (e.g., only medical expense deductions in excess of 7.5 percent of AGI are permitted, only casualty loss deductions in excess of 10 percent of AGI are permitted, your total charitable deductions are capped at a certain percentage of AGI, etc.).                 
                

            
                - The phase-out or reduction of certain entitlements, such as the child tax credit and the earned income credit once you make too much money; the dreaded “kiddie-tax,” where your child’s unearned income is taxed at your higher marginal tax rate (can’t we leave the kiddies alone!).                 
                

            
                - The infamous bracketed marriage penalty, where married couples more quickly jump into higher tax brackets than two single taxpayers (if only there were a double-wide version).                 
                

            
                - And last, but not least, the notorious “alternative minimum tax,” or AMT in its acronym cloak. It may sound like an ATM machine – but unfortunately you are definitely not getting money back! Apparently, if your tax is not high enough, the AMT will make sure it is, and then there goes your deductions.

And should I dare mention when the clock strikes midnight this December 31, the New Year’s baby brings such unwelcome bundles as higher marginal rates, higher rates for capital gains, dividends treated as ordinary income, and the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes in their full splendor?                 
                

            
                As if tax law was not complicated enough, do we really need expiring or “sunset” legislation, such as the Bush tax cuts, which sometimes expire at the whim of the Congress and sometimes are temporarily “extended” or patched-up through legislative acts?

Perplexed? Ready for another bottle of Champagne to drown your sorrows? Even all those newly elected officials, and all those who have come before them, will hit the bubbly a few extra times trying to decipher it all.

The fact is that everyone’s specific tax situation is unique, like a homeland security fingerprint. We all have various tax benefit items, bracket issues, income characterization issues, credits, deductions, etc., that make us special. Dante’s particularized results await you, and only you, in his elaborate and schematic detail.                
                

            
                This means that two years from now, when you are reading about and listening to the politicians on the campaign trail banter on and on about how there will be no new taxes or tax increases when they are elected into office, read this humble accounting professor’s lips: you’ll be better served asking your accountant who to vote for before casting your ballot.

Obama Rolls Dice With Supreme Court,"President Obama is rolling the dice. By pushing the Supreme Court to decide on the legality of his controversial Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare), the president risks having his “legacy” legislation declared unconstitutional. That would be a sizeable body blow for Mr. Obama, who has long expected that voters would cheer on not only the health care overhaul, but also his reelection bid.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                At the least, the high court review will catapult ObamaCare into the 2012 campaign. Since the bill continues to poll poorly (Rasmussen recently found that 56% of registered voters favor repeal), arguing its merits anew cannot bolster the president’s prospects.                 
                

            
                Most important, the debate will remind voters that Mr. Obama spent a year and a half pushing health care “reform” instead of focusing on job creation.                 
                

            
                Also, the imminent imposition of the bill’s unpopular fees and mandates – which include a new Medicare payroll tax on investment income starting in 2012 and a whopping 40% levy on high-end insurance plans which will surely be passed onto consumers -- will loom large.                 
                

            
                The program’s estimated cost continues to soar while insurance fees are skyrocketing, as insurers offset the bill’s requirements that they cover dependent children and persons with “preexisting conditions.”                 
                

            
                In 2014 the outlook will worsen as the waivers granted to 1,472 businesses and unions expire, forcing them to provide expensive coverage or pay fees.                 
                

            
                In 2014, as well, Medicaid rolls will swell, driving up the costs of healthcare across the board. All in all, it is not a pretty picture, and it will not help the president. This was anticipated; the legislation was carefully crafted so that its darker aspects would emerge only after Mr. Obama’s presumed reelection.                
                

            
                Surely this is a decision made in desperation. A win at the Supreme Court could be touted as a victory; but what a hollow one it would be. Unless the economy surges ahead, shortening unemployment lines, the nation will not celebrate ObamaCare, viewed now as the Great Sidetrack.                 
                

            
                How could this politically canny administration have gone so wrong?                 
                

            
                Perhaps it was an acute case of grandiosity. Even before the inauguration balloons had fizzled, Obama’s supporters talked of his legacy. He seemed destined for great things – this young president who had already made history. Time magazine and The New Yorker both ran cover photos of Obama in FDR-pose, complete with iconic cigarette-holder. The American Spectator reported that the president’s staff encouraged writers to “find parallels to FDR and his first hundred days.”                 
                

            
                Sadly, the parallels exist.                 
                

            
                Like FDR, Mr. Obama used the financial crisis to push through the monstrous stimulus bill, to wage war on business leaders and to spread the wings of the federal government.                 
                

            
                ObamaCare is surely the worst manifestation of this power-grab. One lawyer arguing against ObamaCare before the court describes it as “a massive collection of sweeping changes that impose substantial new federal obligations on every corner of society and compel financial action from nearly every citizen of the United States.” That sounds about right.                
                

            
                Politically, and economically, ramming through ObamaCare was a colossal error. It ripped the barely-mended tears in our nation’s political and social fabric and created massive uncertainty among business owners and managers.                 
                

            
                Most important, Mr. Obama spent his political capital, of which each president has but a limited supply. What could he have accomplished instead?                 
                

            
                He might have actually shepherded through Congress the three trade agreements that Obama has repeatedly endorsed, and which without a doubt would have created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have proposed a public/private infrastructure works campaign that would have required only modest funding from the government and yet created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have worked with the business community, fast-tracking applications for new plant construction and providing investment tax credits that could offset the uncertainties posed by the foundering economy, and created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have embraced an all-out development of our energy resources – not investing in solar companies that go bankrupt -- but opening new territories to oil and gas drilling, and created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have sponsored serious tax reform.                
                

            
                Paul Krugman denies that the administration’s insouciant meddling with industries – autos, banks, insurers, oil companies, drug producers, mining, aerospace, credit card outfits, homebuilders and so on – the list lengthens every week- has anything to do with the failed recovery. He is wrong.                 
                

            
                Krugman insists that the lack of investment from the business community is all about inadequate demand. How then to explain the $17.7 billion that U.S. firms invested in Ireland in the first half of this year? Those companies sought lower tax rates, a well educated English-speaking workforce and, according to the Financial Times, an “ease of doing business.” All three items increasingly hard to find in the United States.                
                

            
                Once viewed as the savviest apparatchiks on the planet, the president and his team now seem clueless, consistently misjudging the moment and the message.                 
                

            
                The president’s current “divide and conquer” political approach is grating and is sapping Mr. Obama’s personal appeal. His efforts to portray high-income Americans as the problem, as opposed to the solution, are foolish.                 
                

            
                Unhappily for the country, President Obama has indeed channeled FDR, whose policies subdued our economy for the better part of a decade. Let us hope voters today are smarter than those of the 1930s, and that they judge Mr. Obama on his accomplishments, not on his promises.

"Will Republicans ever take on Obama’s id, ego and sniping?","March 1, 2012: President Obama waves to the crowd after speaking at a fundraiser in New York City. 
	                        
	                        	 (AP)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd recently wrote about the battles between Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum and the tensions between moderate and conservative Republicans. She says that the party’s “id” or “dark forces” are overwhelming the party’s “ego”—its “common sense and reason.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn warns that, “Unless the various constituencies cease their schoolyard sniping, these charges will come back to haunt whoever emerges as the GOP's presidential candidate.”                
                

            
                But what about President Obama’s id, sniping and ego? The president’s id and sniping drive him totally around the bend. For example, he claims -- without support -- that the Republicans’ plan “is let’s have dirtier air, dirtier water, less people with health insurance.”                
                

            
                Yet, for all of Obama’s vilification of Republicans, his ego is so inflated that he dares to portray himself as a unifying blend of common sense and reasonable Republicanism along with a Democrat’s dedication to fairness and equality.                
                

            
                Thus, in October, Obama claimed kinship with Ronald Reagan on closing tax loopholes for the rich: “…26 years ago, another president said that some of these tax loopholes, and I quote, ‘made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing while a bus driver was paying 10 percent of his salary, and that’s crazy. It’s time we stopped it.’ That was 26 years ago. You know the name of that President? Ronald Reagan.”                
                

            
                Conservatives knew Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was a friend of theirs. And Barack Obama, you are no Ronald Reagan.                
                

            
                But Obama’s egotistical audacity is such that he will continue to paint himself in conservative and liberal hues.                
                

            
                Obama did this in a December speech in Kansas: “I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, and when everyone plays by the same rules. Those aren’t Democratic or Republican values; 1% values or 99% values. They’re American values, and we have to reclaim them.”                
                

            
                In that speech, Obama linked himself to Republican president Theodore Roosevelt: “He believed then what we know is true today: that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. But Roosevelt also knew that the free market has never been a free license to take whatever you want from whoever you can. It only works when there are rules of the road to ensure that competition is fair, open, and honest.”                
                

            
                Does Obama plausibly represent the Republicanism of Teddy Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan? Obama’s record shows he speaks loudly but carries a cracked stick.                
                

            
                Obama’s health care reform only passed with outright vote bribery made behind closed—not open—doors. Remember the “Louisiana Purchase” and the “Cornhusker Kickback”? And ObamaCare’s “individual mandate” requiring almost all citizens to buy government-controlled health care by 2014 or face financial penalties is so anti-competitive, unfair and antithetical to a free health care market that 26 states are challenging it and the Supreme Court will decide if the whole law, with its 450 sections, is unconstitutional.                
                

            
                The same bogus attachment to Republican values is in Obama’s other vainglorious legislative “achievement”—the Dodd-Frank regulation overhaul law for financial institutions. According to The Economist magazine, Dodd-Frank’s 848 pages of “rules of the road” are “confused and bloated.”                
                

            
                The Economist catalogs the bureaucratic overreach of Dodd-Frank and writes that, “…one banker immersed in the issue speaks for many when he predicts a decade of grind, with constant disputes in courts and legislatures, finally producing a regime riddled with exceptions and nuances that may, because of its complexity, exacerbate systemic risks rather than mitigate them.”                
                

            
                None of this will deter Obama from combining his id, sniping and ego as he falsely “talks Republican and walks Democratic” in his campaigning and—later—in debates with the Republican nominee.                
                

            
                In 2004, before he addressed the Democratic National Convention, a cocky Obama told David Mendell of The Chicago Tribune, “I'm LeBron, baby. I can play on this level. I got some game.""                
                

            
                Whether it’s comparing himself to Republican superstar presidents or a basketball superstar like LeBron James, President Obama’s id, sniping and ego constitute a game for him.                 
                

            
                If the Republican nominee isn’t skilled enough to expose Obama’s fouls and outscore the president, Obama’s game will dominate for another four years—and the aftereffects will keep dribbling and rebounding for years to come.

"Juan Williams: On health care, Senate Republicans determined to ignore warning signs of political derailment","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                How times have changed on ObamaCare.
                
                


                
            
                A Kaiser Family Foundation poll late last month found that 49 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as ObamaCare is officially called, while 42 percent have an unfavorable view. That is the highest level of support the poll has found for the law since the summer of 2010.
                
                


                
            
                And then there is the GOP failure to find a palatable substitute.
                
                


                
            
                Kaiser found that just eight percent of the public think the Senate should pass the GOP House bill being advanced to replace ObamaCare, a bill the Senate is using as the basis for its health care reform plan.
                
                


                
            
                Even President Trump on a visit to Capitol Hill last week reportedly told Republican senators that he doesn’t like the House GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it is “mean.”
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Seeing Trump jump off the House plan is a very bad sign for Congressional Republicans as they get ready to talk health care with constituents over coming recesses around Independence Day and in August. Even when the president was celebrating the House bill, Republicans faced unruly Memorial Day town hall meetings, with outright protests against their health care proposal.
                
                


                
            
                But Senate Republicans are betting they can do reconstructive surgery on the framework of the unpopular House plan — which the Congressional Budget Office concludes will take insurance away from 23 million people — by making the House bill less “mean.”
                
                


                
            
                They are reported to be looking at increasing subsidies for the poor while providing more time to achieve the far-right goal of doing away with federal guarantees of Medicaid funds to pay medical bills for the poor. The GOP Senate majority also may include special grants to areas hard hit by opioid addiction.
                
                


                
            
                None of this is being done in public hearings. The Congressional Budget Office has not been given a proposal to score. No committees have met.
                
                


                
            
                Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is keeping his caucus on board this night train ride by promising bright days ahead. The dawn will bring tax reform that will cut taxes for the rich – another promise the GOP wants to keep ahead of the 2018 midterms. But they can only get there once passage of a health care deal is in the rearview mirror.
                
                


                
            
                So Senate Republicans steam ahead on this night train despite red lights warning of political derailment. Their proposals have not been vetted by their own caucus, the health care industry or their constituents.
                
                


                
            
                The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page buys into the McConnell strategy. It contends the big players know what is in the Senate bill. Also, the paper views Democrats as insincere on the grounds that nothing will please liberal critics except renewal of ObamaCare.
                
                


                
            
                Well, the proof will be in the bill.
                
                


                
            
                Let’s see if the GOP can put a plan before the public that provides medical insurance to more people than ObamaCare and lowers premiums; that offers protections for people with pre-existing conditions; that pays bills for mental health, maternity and drug problems; that does away with yearly and lifetime caps on spending; and that protects young people from being prematurely pushed off of their parents’ plans.
                
                


                
            
                To be clear, it isn’t all 52 Senate Republicans who are on board for these secret negotiations. A working group of 13 arch-conservative men led by McConnell got tickets to ride.
                
                


                
            
                Noticeably not on board are female GOP senators, including the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, Susan Collins of Maine, who has a background as a state insurance regulator. Also excluded was South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, who made his fortune as an insurance executive in the Palmetto State.
                
                


                
            
                This lack of diversity is important because smoke signals coming from the GOP’s private talks appear to include changes to health care law that will disproportionately harm the poor, the elderly, women and people of color.
                
                


                
            
                Polls show the public consistently rejecting the House plan. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found 62 percent of voters disapprove of the House bill while just 17 percent approve of it.
                
                


                
            
                Quinnipiac also found that 30 percent of voters say Trump and Congress should not repeal any part of ObamaCare. And 47 percent said they should repeal only some parts of it.
                
                


                
            
                Meanwhile, Democrats are rushing into the town square in advance of the 2018 elections pointing to rising support for ObamaCare. And they are damning the Republicans with charges of hypocrisy.
                
                


                
            
                They point to then-House Republican Leader John Boehner’s (Ohio) epic rant before the Democrats’ pushed through ObamaCare on a party-line vote in 2010.
                
                


                
            
                “Look at how this bill was written,” Boehner fumed. “Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability, without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell, no you can’t! Have you read the bill? …Hell, no you haven’t! ...Shame on this body!”
                
                


                
            
                But the Republicans of 2017 roll along, even though they are open to the very same charges.
                
                


                
            
                Even if the Senate bill gets 50 votes once the deal is public, it will still have to survive a conference committee with the House Freedom Caucus hardliners.
                
                


                
            
                Is it any wonder the Senate Republicans want to keep their plan secret?

No. Congress needs to go back to the drawing board on health care reform.

Democrats flee from ObamaCare disaster but voters will find them in 2014,"President Barack Obama pauses while speaking about his signature health care law, Thursday, Nov. 14, 2013, in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington. Bowing to pressure, President Barack Obama intends to permit continued sale of individual insurance plans that have been canceled because they failed to meet coverage standards under the health care law, officials said Thursday.

                Nearly four years ago, voters sent a very powerful message to President Obama and Democrats in Washington by electing a little-known Republican state senator to the so-called “Kennedy seat.” The message then was simple: “we don’t want ObamaCare.”
 
 Then, like now, Democrats in Washington ignored the will of the people, twisting themselves into pretzels to ram this bill through Congress using backroom political maneuvering.
 
 Back then, voters opposed this bill because they didn’t want the federal government taking over something as private and personal as health care coverage. On top of that, ObamaCare levied 18 new job-killing taxes and gutted Medicare for seniors by more than half a trillion dollars.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                [pullquote]
 
 Today, after the catastrophic rollout of the last month, the anti-ObamaCare message has only intensified. It’s more than just a non-functional web site – which is an embarrassment in and of itself, but only the tip of the iceberg.
 
 Now, we are learning that contrary to the promises made by President Obama and his supporters in Congress, Americans who like their current health care plans actually can’t keep it. In fact, millions of Americans across the country have received cancellation letters in the mail telling them their current health plans will soon cease to exist.
 
 Supporters of ObamaCare blatantly misled their constituents with this broken promise. The American people are fed up with this fiasco, and voters are ready to make their voices heard.
 
 But it’s not just President Obama who needs to be held to account. It is also every single Democratic senator and congressman that voted for the health care bill. Without their support, it wouldn’t have happened.
 
 These Democratic legislators are all on the hook. Any attempt to offer legislation to delay implementation or extend the sign-up period is nothing more than a transparent political stunt from an incumbent senator or congressman literally running for their political life.
 
 If they didn’t want this health care plan, they shouldn’t have voted for it and made it the law of the land.
 
 Everyone shares the goal of ensuring that all our people have access to affordable and high quality health care.                  
                

            
                Republicans have a much different view on how we get there.                  
                

            
                We believe health care reform should be left to the individual states so that they can come up with a plan best tailored for their citizens and their needs. What works in New Hampshire or Massachusetts may not work in New Mexico or Nevada, and vice versa.
 
 Instead of a government takeover from D.C., we should let the states experiment and be the “test tubes of democracy” that our Founding Fathers envisioned when they established our country.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, that didn’t happen and our nation now faces the prospect of a nonfunctional health care bill that will destabilize the entire market and lead to higher premiums across the board.
 
 Democrats who voted for this bill may be running for the hills, but they can’t hide forever.

                In next year’s midterm elections, voters across the country are ready once again to send an unmistakable message: if you ignore the will of your constituents, before long, you’ll find yourself looking for a new line of work.
 
 That’s the beauty of our democracy, and is exactly what the Founding Fathers envisioned."
"The Incredible, Sinking Obama","President Obama’s high-handedness is causing the public to backhand him in recent polls.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                A national uproar has followed the president’s declaration last Friday that he supports a Muslim group’s right to build a mosque and a $100-million community center two blocks from Ground Zero, where about 2,600 civilians died in the 9/11 World Trade Center attack. A Fox News poll also released on August 13  found that ""61 percent of voters think the Muslim group has the right to build a mosque in lower Manhattan. However, 64 percent think it would be wrong to put a mosque there.”                
                

            
                This fits a pattern of Obama’s sliding polls. Several of the president’s high-handed policies conflict with majority public opinion.                
                

            
                • In a Quinnipiac University poll 65% of registered voters think that “President Obama’s policies” have either “hurt the economy or haven’t made a difference.” An overwhelming 84% say they think “President Obama’s policies have either “hurt or haven’t made a difference” in their “personal financial situation.”                
                

            
                • In a Pew Research/National Journal poll of adults nationwide, 57% said they think “the economic stimulus” has failed to keep “unemployment from getting even worse” and 66% think “the economic stimulus” has “increased the federal budget deficit.”                
                

            
                • In a Time magazine poll of adults nationwide, 53% said that the economy would be “better off if the government had not spent…additional money on the stimulus program” and 67% “oppose additional government spending for a second stimulus package.”                
                

            
                • In a CBS poll 52% of Americans believe that “Barack Obama has been spending too little time trying to fix the nation’s economy and create jobs.”                
                

            
                • On the issue that the president has arguably spent the most time on during his presidency—pushing through health care reform—a Rasmussen national telephone survey found that, “57% of likely U.S. voters say the recently passed health care law will be bad for the country.                 
                

            
                That’s the highest level of pessimism measured since regular tracking began following Congress' passage of the law in late March,” and “59% of all voters now favor repeal of the health care bill.”                
                

            
                • Just before passage of the president’s second major legislative initiative—his financial regulation overhaul—an Associated Press-GfK Poll determined that “64 percent of those surveyed aren't confident that a financial regulation overhaul…will avert another meltdown.”                
                

            
                • A Rasmussen national telephone survey found that, “Voters by a two-to-one margin oppose[d] the U.S. Justice Department’s decision to challenge the legality of Arizona’s new immigration law in federal court.”                 
                

            
                Just after a U.S. district court judge (a Clinton appointee) struck down sections of that Arizona law, 59% of those surveyed told Rasmussen that they, “favor passage of an Arizona-like immigration law in their state.”                
                

            
                • In a USA TODAY/Gallup poll, “Support for Obama's management of the [Afghanistan] war fell to 36%, down from 48% in a February poll. Now, a record 43% also say it was a mistake to go to war there after the terrorist attacks in 2001.”                
                

            
                • The same poll also found that, “Even Obama's handling of the war in Iraq received record-low approval, despite a drawdown of 90,000 troops and the planned, on-schedule end of U.S. combat operations there this month.” And, “Only 41% of those surveyed…approved of the way Obama is handling his job, his lowest rating in the USA Today/Gallup Poll since he took office in January 2009.”                
                

            
                The president’s high-handedness on many other issues shows him ignoring or defying public opinion. Here’s a partial list:                
                

            
                • His pledge to shut down the prison at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.                
                

            
                • His big government agenda—out of control spending, debt, and deficits.                
                

            
                • His under the table and over the top “deal making” in Congress (i.e. vote buying) to pass legislation.                
                

            
                • His turning toxic companies like AIG and toxic “government-sponsored enterprises” like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into virtual wards of the state—eating up billions in taxpayer money each month.                
                

            
                • His showering of taxpayer money and special favors on special interests (particularly unions).                
                

            
                Even in a poll by Democracy Corps—the firm run by Democratic strategists James Carville and Stan Greenberg—56% of likely voters said that “liberal” describes Barack Obama “very well or well” and 55% said the same about labeling Obama a “socialist.”                
                

            
                One of Obama’s heroes, President Abraham Lincoln, said, “With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed.”                
                

            
                For President Obama, playing high-handed with the public is playing a losing hand.

Obama's Comeback Begins On Wednesday Morning,"Democrats appear headed for a stunning series of defeats in the congressional midterm elections.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                That is a great political result – for Obama and the Democrats.

Starting Wednesday, Americans will expect the Republicans for the first time under Obama to be partners in leading the country – and that they can not do – not with their partners from the Tea Party, big business and lobbyists in tow.

They need to go from being the “party of no” to the party of “we are all in this together.” The odds on that are pretty slim.

Tea Party enthusiasts have not worked this hard in search of compromise. Lobbyists and big business want repeal of health care reform and financial regulatory reform.

That will leave a big opening for the president. People will see what he has been up against in a sharply new and clear way. As he prepares to seek re-election, he will have something to run against, as his opponents have been so good at doing.

When the Republicans take control of the House, as they will, they will have to govern.

They show no indication that they want to stop doing “business as usual” in Washington.

If this election cycle has proven anything, it is that the political right wing is still closely aligned with the lobbyists and other corporate interests, both foreign and domestic.

It’s also going to be much harder to bend the truth while governing.

You can’t govern on a platform of “the president is a Muslim and a socialist.”

You may not like “European-style socialized medicine,” but what about coverage for pre-existing conditions. Obstructing is not governing.

And what about ending tax breaks for millionaires? Cutting government spending? I don’t think they can (or want to) accomplish either of these.

Conversely, I think the president will have been “shaken-up” enough by this election to get the message. It is time to really do the people’s business differently. You don’t have all the answers. You must be willing to listen to a broader group of people. Change means doing things differently and with different people.

So there will be a big political opportunity created for Obama and the Democrats by this Republican congressional House sweep.

Obama’s comeback begins Wednesday morning.

What Occupy Wall Street Protesters Really Believe,"President Obama and the Democratic leadership are making a critical error in embracing the Occupy Wall Street movement—and it may cost them the 2012 election.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Last week, senior White House adviser David Plouffe said that ""the protests you're seeing are the same conversations people are having in living rooms and kitchens all across America. . . . People are frustrated by an economy that does not reward hard work and responsibility, where Wall Street and Main Street don't seem to play by the same set of rules."" Nancy Pelosi and others have echoed the message.                
                

            
                Yet the Occupy Wall Street movement reflects values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American people—and particularly with swing voters who are largely independent and have been trending away from the president since the debate over health-care reform.                
                

            
                The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies. On Oct. 10 and 11, Arielle Alter Confino, a senior researcher at my polling firm, interviewed nearly 200 protesters in New York's Zuccotti Park. Our findings probably represent the first systematic random sample of Occupy Wall Street opinion.                
                

            
                Our research shows clearly that the movement doesn't represent unemployed America and is not ideologically diverse. Rather, it comprises an unrepresentative segment of the electorate that believes in radical redistribution of wealth, civil disobedience and, in some instances, violence. Half (52%) have participated in a political movement before, virtually all (98%) say they would support civil disobedience to achieve their goals, and nearly one-third (31%) would support violence to advance their agenda.                
                

            
                The vast majority of demonstrators are actually employed, and the proportion of protesters unemployed (15%) is within single digits of the national unemployment rate (9.1%).

Obama at Notre Dame -- Let the Listening On Abortion Begin,"Sat, 16 May 2009 19:41:34 +0000 –  For the first time in three decades an American politician is willing to start a conversation that others have avoided since Rove vs. Wade was decided by the Supreme Court in 1972. President Obama made a politically fearless but a politically high-risk move by accepting the invitation to speak at one of America's great Catholic universities --Notre Dame. The president gets invitations to speak at almost every college graduation in the United States and he chose to speak at Notre Dame. As Itzhak Rabin once noted -- you can only make peace with your enemies. By speaking at an institution that is part of the Catholic Church the president seeks to cross what, heretofore, has been a seeming unbridgeable divide.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                ---------------                 
                

            
                
 For the first time in decades we have an open-minded president who has announced that he is prepared to listen and learn from those who disagree with him.
                
                

            
                The two main opponents in the abortion debate standing in the corner talking to themselves will not solve the issue of abortion. Until now politicians have taken the safe route of preaching to the choir -- liberal politicians talking to pro-choice audience and conservatives talking to anti-abortion groups. President Obama is now going to where no politician has gone before. In doing so he risks alienating some important constituencies such as blue collar Catholics and others who are strongly against the right to choose.                
                

            
                But this issue goes directly to the definition of leadership. If President Obama is genuinely president of all the people then he must be prepared to address the concerns of those people who may vehemently disagree with him. There are also real compromises that can be made -- especially around the issue of late term abortions. I have always advocated for setting up a system similar to hospital transplant boards for late term abortions. These boards make decisions about who gets to receive an organs and who does not. A similar system could be set up for late term abortions. Neither side of the debate would be happy but that is the nature of compromise.                
                

            
                As a liberal I hope that President Obama opens some minds on this issue. But as a person who believes that the president must be willing to be a leader and create open dialogue it may well be that he'll learn a thing or two from those who disagree with him. The large point is that unless these conversations take place between those on opposite sides of the issue the country will go nowhere. Think of the range of issues where the country has gone nowhere: abortion, immigration, gun control, Social Security and Health care reform. For the first time in decades we have an open-minded president who has announced that he is prepared to listen and learn from those who disagree with him.                
                

            
                Remember, it was President Obama who invited Pastor Rick Warren to speak at his Inauguration despite protests from gay supporters. It was President Obama who, despite protests from anti-war activists, has recommitted to winning the war in Afghanistan. This is a president who, despite the understandable efforts of the Republicans to paint him as a liberal cannot be so easily boxed in. Democracy is really a large conversation among people who disagree. I am glad we finally have a president prepared to speak its language.

The Two Promises Obama's Managed to Keep,"Reuters
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                As President Obama’s first year in office wraps up this week, it’s a good time to review where he stands on fulfilling some of the high-profile promises he made in the campaign and as president. During the campaign, Mr. Obama seemed purposefully vague on what he was actually going to DO as president except promising that he would bring “hope” and “change.” But he did make some notable promises, about 20% of which he seems to have fulfilled.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Here, in descending order is my list of President Obama’s top 10 campaign promises. Let’s start with the two major promises the president’s managed to keep                
                

            
                PROMISES KEPT:                
                

            
                1. “Date Night.” The first husband promised to take his wife, Michelle out for a “date night” in New York City – and he did. But it came at huge taxpayer expense with Secret Service blanketing Broadway and stopping NYC traffic. An enjoyable, if expensive, time was had by all.                
                

            
                2. “Dog.” He promised to get his children a dog. Bo the Portuguese water dog and the first daughters apparently get along fine. Given the crowded state of animal shelters during the recession, Bo is one lucky pup. Not so the American people.                 
                

            
                PROMISES NOT KEPT:                
                

            
                And here are the 8 remaining promises our president hasn't managed to keep:                
                

            
                3. Unemployment. We were told that if Congress approved the $787 billion stimulus package unemployment would fall from its then-high of 7.6%, (that number already being the highest rate America had seen since 1992) and never climb higher than 8 percent. It’s now at 10% and rising; if you include in that number the number of Americans who’ve given up looking for work, the real unemployment rate is over 17%. This was entirely predictable, because the stimulus bill simply *added* to the government’s debt and didn’t help small businesses to expand and hire new workers.                
                

            
                4. Stimulus Jobs. We were also promised that stimulus projects were “shovel ready” – all they would need would be federal funds, and presto, jobs would come. Not quite. In New Hampshire, by July of 2009, $416 million in stimulus funds had generated a grand total of 50 government jobs – and 34 of them were temporary positions. Sometimes, though, the “shovel” literal did come with the job, as when The New York Times reported that stimulus funds had been used to buy a riding lawnmower for a cemetery. The Obama administration recently claimed that 2 million jobs were saved or created by the stimulus in 2009 but the administration has provided scant evidence for this claim. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton’s pollster received $6 million in stimulus funds, which produced exactly three jobs.                
                

            
                5. Lobbying. Candidate Obama promised in 2007 that “When you walk into my administration, you will not be able to work on regulations or contracts directly related to your former employer for two years.” President Obama issued new ethics regulations, but the White House has already waived them 15 times so far, not least for the Deputy Secretary of Defense and the NASA Administrator. Perhaps he belatedly discovered that he needs to fill the government with experts – but then why make the promise?                
                

            
                6. Middle-class Taxes. On the campaign trail candidate Obama often promised that if you made less than $250,000, your taxes would not go up. Perhaps President Obama doesn’t think fees or other government-imposed costs count as “taxes”. To keep this promise, the president would have to veto both the House and Senate version of health care reform bills, each of which raises fees and costs on people in this financial bracket – in other words, most Americans. The Senate bill, for instance, includes a new marriage penalty and a tax on certain health plans, often employer-provided. Obamacare would also include an individual mandate to obtain health insurance – contrary to his repeated insistence during the campaign that “there is no mandate.”                
                

            
                7. Seniors’ Income Tax. In a related issue, Obama also promised to end the income tax for the 7,000,000 seniors making less than $50,000, “saving them an average of $1,400 a year.” That hasn’t happened; he needs the money to pay for Obamacare, which will actually cut funds for Medicare on which seniors depend.                
                

            
                8. Meeting with Dictators. During the Democratic YouTube debate, Obama famously--if rashly--promised that he would meet without any precondition with the leaders of countries like North Korea, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and Cuba. Fortunately, other than a photo-op with Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, this hasn’t happened, although Bill Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il (or his stunt double).                
                

            
                9. “Card Check.” Obama promised union leaders that this attempt to overturn decades of secret ballot protections for union members would become “the law of the land” if he were elected.” Thankfully, Congress hasn’t obliged him--yet.                
                

            
                10. Swine Flu. In April, Obama said that the government was closely monitoring the H1N1 swine flu and promised appropriate precautions -- but in October HHS announced that there wouldn’t be enough supplies of vaccine for H1N1 flu as they had promised. Senators Joe Lieberman (I-CT) and Susan Collins (R-ME) have asked why the government “insisted on promoting a plan for which the federal government did not have anywhere near sufficient resources to implement.”                
                

            
                We should all be glad that Obama has put aside many of his campaign promises. But, after one year in the Oval Office, I think it’s fair to say that Mr. Obama’s supporters didn’t get the “change” that they were expecting.

Taking Aim at the College Dream -- What's Team Obama's Agenda?,"The U.S. Education Department recently unveiled some rather stunning proposed new regulations. With the publication of the draft rules, the Obama administration’s goal of putting private-sector colleges and universities on an extremely short government leash became crystal clear.

The regulations, if finalized, will severely limit the ability of students who choose to attend those schools – which are run as businesses – to obtain federal student loans. Without student loans, students won’t be able to enroll. Without enrollees, the schools themselves will contract or even fold.

But while the proposed regulation is bold, the question of why the Department is taking such extreme action remained unclear.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Many, including myself in this April column, have wondered if department officials are revealing their own elitism, their true bias against schools that emphasize vocational education and cater to working-class adults.                 
                

            
                After all, for-profit colleges and universities don’t look much like the elite schools that these officials attended when they were in their late teens and early 20s. Private-sector schools are filled with older students and more minorities than any other group of public or non-profit institutions. Most are seeking a career-focused degree, something that will help them advance beyond the blue-collar jobs they have held since high school. All of this is foreign ground for the more privileged Obama appointees.

On August 2, the elitism theory gained an interesting piece of evidence. During the question-and-answer period of a speech at the New America Foundation, Education Department Deputy Undersecretary (and former White House advisor) James Kvaal talked about the data that was used to justify the crackdown on student loans for a certain class of students. Kvaal revealed that, to show how unable these students allegedly are to re-pay their government loans, his Department used graduate income data from the state of Missouri.

Huh?

A national, sweeping regulation that is so big that it included a 70-page analysis of what its impact will be and 80 pages rationalizing its necessity was developed based on data from one state?

A regulation that will effectively deny educational opportunity to tens of thousands of working Americans in all 50 states is justified by data from Missouri alone?

This more than smacks of a rush-to-judgment and a rush-to-over-regulate. It’s the equivalent of justifying national financial industry overhaul or national health-care reform on data from one state or municipality. It’s lazy at best, arrogant at worst.

To build this type of high-impact public policy on such a weak foundation indicates an approach that is ideological, not based on facts or evidence. Specifically, it makes Obama appointees look like old-school snobs who don’t think working-class people are good investments when it comes to higher education.

The regulations’ authors are starting to look and quack like elite ducks. If the bias of privilege is, in fact, at the heart of this massive regulatory move that amounts to near-nationalization of private-sector schools, the ducks will be guilty of nothing less than an abuse of power. I sincerely hope that is not the case, but other reasons are getting harder to identify and believe.

Baucus Bill Encourages Americans to DROP Insurance Coverage,"What if you, and every member of your family, had the chance to save $4,000 each?. Would you be interested? Under the terms of what's being called ""the Baucus bill"" -- Washington-speak for the bill the Senate Finance Committee will vote on tomorrow -- that is how much you could save by dropping your health insurance.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                People might have thought that health care reform would lead to an increase in the number of people getting health insurance coverage. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office claims the Senate Finance Committee's health care bill will reduce the number of uninsured in 2019 by about 29 million,"" but the financial rewards are huge for people if they drop their insurance. Amazingly the CBO makes this prediction of 29 million more insured Americans without ever once analyzing the financial incentive for those who are already insured to drop their insurance.                
                

            
                Consider some numbers. In 2008, the average price of an individual insurance policy was $4,704 and it was $12,682 for a family of four. But the Baucus bill explicitly states that insurance companies ""would be prohibited from excluding coverage for pre-existing health conditions.""                 
                

            
                Thus, you may wait until you have been diagnosed with cancer or are pregnant or have some other problem to purchase insurance. True, there is a fine if you do not buy insurance but it is very small compared to the actual price of the insurance. The fine will eventually reach ""$750 per adult in the household. This per adult penalty would also be phased in: For 2013, $0; $200 for 2014; $400 for 2015; $600 in 2016 and $750 in 2017."" Even if the cost of insurance didn't rise by 2019, which is extremely doubtful, paying the fine and waiting until you're sick before you got insurance would easily save you $4,000 per person insured. -- Every American could save thousands of dollars, every year, by waiting to buy insurance until they are seriously ill or get pregnant. This would affect a lot of people. Although not everyone may immediately feel comfortable dropping their insurance, especially those with minor health problems, many people will. And more and more will do so as the price of the ""same"" insurance keeps on increasing.                
                

            
                Could you imagine what it would be like if you could buy auto insurance right after you have had an accident and then be allowed to immediately drop it again once the car was fixed? Everyone would understand that's not how insurance works. The ""insurance"" fee would be the price of what it costs to get the car fixed plus the administrative costs of handling the ""insurance.""                
                

            
                The same applies to health care. -- The more people who shy away from buying insurance when they are healthy, the higher the price of insurance will be for those who buy it when they are ill. -- There will be a quick unraveling of the insurance system as everyone suddenly realizes that insurance has become something you only need to buy when you are really sick. Of course, this means that insurance companies will stop insuring people and, instead, health care will be transformed into a fee for service system.                
                

            
                The proposed ""Baucus bill"" health care reform would thus both dramatically reduce the number of people with insurance and dramatically increase insurance premiums. Of course, that's just the opposite of how the program is being sold.                 
                

            
                Mr. President, if this is what you meant when you said that you wouldn't ""mess"" with people's insurance if they were happy with it, we don't need your help.

"At Long Last, Universal Health Care","The House of Representatives will almost certainly vote to pass health care reform on Sunday. For fifty years we Democrats have sought to make health care a right not a privilege for all Americans. Over that time Republicans have delayed, distorted, demeaned, and outright lied to the American people to destroy health care reform and protect the big insurance companies. There’s no doubt those insurance boys were in ""good hands"" with the GOP.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Barring some last minute “March Surprise” by the Republicans, their water carrying days will be over sometime on Sunday. Finally no more of Sarah Palins’s uninformed (nothing new there) and sophomoric “death panels” or right-wing talk radio hosts screaming about a “government takeover” of health care or the equally uninformed and uneducated screaming about “socialism.” And maybe we’ll even get a break from the tea party conspiracy crowd with their birthers, blowhards, and militia conspiracy nuts.                
                

            
                I congratulate in advance Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and President Obama who finally found his voice on health care reform in the last month. I might also suggest to the conservative commentators who are not wing-nuts that they cease fire and take time to read the bill before they comment further. I was particularly taken with a Wall Street Journal piece by the normally coherent Peggy Noonan. In her column on Saturday she berated Obama for postponing his trip to Australia suggesting that great damage would be done to what has been a strong relationship.                
                

            
                You can calm down Peggy and take a deep breath. I happened to be having lunch with the deputy Australian Ambassador who was responsible for both the logistics and substance of President Obama’s trip “down under” when the announcement was made. He was not at all upset by the delay and said he would expect Obama to see health care reform to its conclusion. As he said, “If the shoe was on the other foot Prime Minister Rudd (Australia’s new leader) would have stayed in Canberra.""                
                

            
                Like so many other Republicans, Noonan has somehow come to believe that the health care reform bill will cause the health care system to disintegrate; throw grandma out of Medicare and into the streets; and throw young people who don’t buy insurance into jail. They apparently bought into Congressional Republicans' distortions meant to scare Americans away from reform.
Their behavior was shameless, their supporters's tactics sordid, and the substance of their debate was nothing less than dishonest. I suspect Republicans will now turn to the regulation of the financial industry (the very people that took us to the brink of a Depression) as yet another important Obama reform to derail. Maybe now the press and the public will take Republican tactics for what they are: stopping Obama at any cost.                
                

            
                If, somehow, in the next 24 hours, Republicans find a way to destroy health care reform, don’t expect me to eat my words. Rather expect me and millions of others to expose Congressional Republicans for the uber-partisan, right-wing demagogues they have sadly become.

Want to ditch ObamaCare? Let's copy Singapore's health care miracle,"(Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Give how badly we’ve managed to botch up health care here in the United States, you’d probably be surprised to find out that another country—Singapore—has used forgotten American ideas to build the world’s greatest healthcare system.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As the political debate over health care reform heats up again, it is important to understand both what Singapore has built as well as the fact that everything that it has accomplished has been shown to work just as well here in the United States, too.                
                

            
                Singapore is the only country in the world that can boast of being in the top five in infant mortality, life expectancy, and maternal mortality.  Better yet, when Business Week compared countries on 21 different healthcare metrics, Singapore stood out as the world’s healthiest country.                
                

            
                By contrast, the U.S. health care system delivers mediocre results while spending more than any other nation on health care. The United States ranks 41st in life expectancy, 55th in infant mortality, and 49th in maternal mortality while spending nearly 18 percent of GDP on health care.                 
                

            
                By contrast, other developed nations deliver much better results while spending between 9 and 12 percent of GDP.  So getting our 18 percent of GDP down to the typical 9 to 12 percent would be a major accomplishment.                
                

            
                But the fact remains that Singapore is managing to deliver the world’s very best health outcomes for just 4.7 percent of GDP—or less than half of what Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom are spending.                
                

            
                How does Singapore do it? By empowering consumers and fostering competition.                
                

            
                The most fundamental way to empower consumers is by providing real health security. So Singapore provides true universal access as well as coverage for preexisting conditions. Singapore then builds on that by making sure that everyone—rich and poor, young and old—has money to pay for access to the same doctors and the same facilities.                
                

            
                This is done by ensuring plentiful contributions into health savings accounts and by providing a high-deductible health insurance plan that people can actually afford—not only the premiums, but the deductibles and copays, too.                 
                

            
                Providing people with adequate health savings balances and universal high-deductible health insurance transforms people into empowered consumers. The government then provides them with price-comparison data as well as provider-performance data so people can comparison shop both on price and quality.  The result is the world’s most competitive healthcare market—one in which providers have to deliver on both quality and price if they are going to survive.                
                

            
                The results are startling. Major surgeries cost 62 to 92 percent less in Singapore. As just one example, a heart-bypass surgery that would cost $130,000 in the United States costs just $18,000 in Singapore. Overall, Singapore spends 72 percent less per person on health care than the United States and between 46 and 57 percent less than Canada, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom.                 
                

            
                If we could cut our health care spending down to Singapore’s level, we would have annual savings of about 12.2 percent of GDP, or about $2.1 trillion per year.                  
                

            
                That’s such a huge amount of money that we could balance the federal budget, bring Medicare and Medicaid into long-run actuarial balance, and still have over $1 trillion per year left over to spend on other crucial national priorities such as infrastructure, education, and national defense.                
                

            
                A key point is that everything that Singapore has accomplished has already been shown to work here in the United States.  Whole Foods Markets has a wildly popular Singapore-style health care plan that was approved by its unions.  And the State of Indiana proved that Singapore-style health insurance works for both middle-class government employees as well as indigent Medicaid recipients.                
                

            
                Local control also creates flexibility and strength in addition to slashing red tape and administrative costs. By empowering individuals to choose and by forcing providers to compete, the healthcare system becomes bottom-up rather than top-down.                   
                

            
                That bottom-up perspective is important for policymakers looking for solutions. The decentralization that comes from empowering individuals will allow our healthcare system to cope with the size and diversity of United States far better than the central planning and rigid rules embraced by our current system.                 
                

            
                We the People is the basis of our Constitution.  It should also be the basis for totally reforming our healthcare system. We can provide the highest quality, lowest-cost healthcare in the world if we only get out of our own way and trust ordinary Americans to make wise decisions for themselves and their families.

A physician's take on Trump's health care plan,"Donald Trump finally released his position paper on health care reform this week, clarifying and strengthening what had been a liability, one that his major opponents, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, had mocked for its inconsistencies and assertions.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As a practicing physician who has studied and been victimized by the damaging effects of ObamaCare, I was glad to see Trump define his position. I am on the lookout for any plan that aims to undo the worst of ObamaCare: spiraling premiums, limited access to providers, high deductibles that hamstring poor and middle-class patients and heavy federal subsidies and related tax hikes.                
                

            
                Complex candidate position papers are standard fare, but the fact is that little or none of their detail will be utilized when the election is over. So I’m more interested in broad brush strokes at this point, and the American public should be too. With this in mind, let’s examine the essential bones of Trump’s health care plan, even if it lacks the flesh of the other candidates’. He released seven key points:                
                

            
                1. Repeal and replace. Trump has said this repeatedly, and it carries more weight now than previous threats thrown at President Obama’s veto pen. The Health Care Choices Act, authored by Cruz and co-sponsored by Rubio last year, included central aspects of both senators’ positions: the ability to buy health insurance across state lines and eliminating the mandate to buy insurance, the insurance marketplaces and federal subsidies. But it had zero chance of becoming law. “Repeal and replace” can become a reality only if a Republican wins the presidency.                
                

            
                2: Modify the law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. “The lines, the lines,” Trump says on the stump, referring to removing the ban, not to the growing waiting lines in doctors’ offices. Like Rubio and Cruz, Trump favors portability of health insurance from state to state. As a mega businessman, he knows this will introduce more competition into the system and drive premiums down. If, for example, Nevada offers a cheaper yet equally effective insurance product as New York, my patients could buy it there and use it here.                
                

            
                3: Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premiums on their tax returns. Businesses take these deductions, so why shouldn’t individuals? This will help people who previously couldn’t afford insurance to buy it. Rubio, too, has backed the idea of tax incentives to buy health insurance.                
                

            
                4: Health Savings Accounts. Trump proposes to expand this program. Contributions should be tax-free and be allowed to accumulate and become part of the patient’s estate. Health savings accounts work well in the doctor’s office, as a patients are more aware of what services they’re getting and what they’re actually paying for them.                
                

            
                5. All prices should be transparent. Patients should be able to shop for the best prices for procedures, examinations, etc. This will help drive prices down to a more affordable range. Right now, something like an echocardiogram is far more expensive at one hospital than another. xxxx                
                

            
                6. Block-grant Medicaid to the states. States know their people the best, Trump says, “and can manage the administration of Medicaid without federal overhead.” Rubio, too, recommends block grants. But Trump refused to denounce Medicaid expansion in New Hampshire when he was campaigning there. He has said repeatedly, “I will not let people die on the streets.” His plan doesn’t take into account that Medicaid is an expensive and inefficient state-administered insurance plan that has a narrow network of doctors and badly needs an overhaul. Simply expanding it, the way ObamaCare does, or handing over full responsibility to the states is not the best solution. Perhaps a more informed Trump will come to see this.                 
                

            
                7. Remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. Trump believes special interests are driving up prices, and he wants consumers to be able to import drugs, which will drive prices down. He has also said that Medicare should be able to negotiate prices, a controversial change. Since Medicare frequently sets the standard for prices in the industry, this makes sense – especially when it comes to the overinflated prices of new cancer and heart drugs. Rubio proposes reforming Medicare by transitioning to a privately funded premium support program intended to control costs while maintaining services, though prior efforts to privatize Medicare have failed. Cruz would raise the Medicare eligibility age, which I believe is a good idea.                
                

            
                In a Feb. 18 interview with CNN, Trump indicated he would keep ObamaCare’s individual mandate, which makes you pay a fine if you don’t have health insurance. But the next day he tweeted that he would remove the mandate (a central piece of ObamaCare) and install a “backstop for pre-existing conditions.” His positions on health care seem to be evolving as he learns more.  In this week’s position paper, it is clear that he intends to get rid of the individual mandate. During last week’s debate, he flatly denied Cruz’s accusation that he wants the government to pay for everyone’s health care. Perhaps Trump would have agreed with President Richard Nixon, who in 1974 proposed a comprehensive health reform plan that included cost-sharing health coverage, subsidized by the federal government, for poor Americans. This plan probably would have passed, if not for Watergate.                
                

            
                Trump’s position paper on health care goes on to say that enforcing immigration laws will relieve economic pressures. His wall would theoretically help out hospitals in the South and Southwest that are overburdened by the costs of services they provide to illegal immigrants who can’t pay for them. Meanwhile, the heroin trade is burgeoning, with 300,000 more users than a decade ago and over 10,000 overdose deaths per year. Decreasing these numbers would decrease U.S. health care costs substantially.                
                

            
                So Donald Trump has a health care plan. It needs more flesh on its bones, but at first glance it is not as reckless as his main opponents (both huge ObamaCare critics) say it is. Trump promises to reverse at least some of the damage ObamaCare has done to my patients and me. I believe that if he’s elected, he’ll try.

                Every president has his portrait painted early on in his first term. The figurative portrait of President Obama the public sees is the gilded orator who can give a great speech but fails to produce the necessary action. It doesn’t matter if that is the full truth about the president it is how he has been painted by public opinion. President Obama must address that perception in his State of the Union speech on Wednesday night. His address needs to be an action speech.

                The president must outline his plan to get America working again. It has to be bold and specific.

He needs to propose legislation and then tell the Republicans that if they have a plan, it cannot be just a “cut taxes and wait plan,” but it must be a real plan. He ought to announce that he will be holding office hours at The White House over the next four weekends. He should then invite Republicans to come over and present any plans and legislation they have.

The president also needs to speak to all of the major groups in America that are unhappy. He should tell the Tea Party supporters that he hears them. He should let liberals know that he hears them, too, and he must tell the Blue Dogs that he hears their vocal barking.                
                

            
                He needs to let voters know that he hears their anger and frustration about the state of the union and what he intends to do about it.                
                

            
                President Obama needs to explain why he decided to bail out Wall Street and why Main Street has a right to be angry. He should then announce that he is going to take a bus tour of Main Street USA to see first-hand what Americans have been coping with in the year since he was inaugurated. He needs to invite members of Congress -- from both sides of the aisle -- to accompany him and to work with him while sitting on the bus to develop legislation that is going to put America back to work.

Health care must be a central part of his State of the Union address. The president should outline what will happen to our country if we don’t have major health care reform. He should ask the Republicans to call him up if they have a plan that is going to insure another 35 million Americans. By doing this he will put the opposition on the defensive. He should let America know exactly what steps he will take if health care does not pass Congress in the next few months.

The Republicans have owned the cap-and-trade debate and President Obama must make the case for green jobs and green technology as methods to grow the economy. He needs to give examples of new technologies that are employing people. He needs to show how his plan is going to make America into a world leader again the way we were 50 years ago.
Again, he should challenge the naysayers to come up with better plans if they don’t like his proposals. “I am all ears,” he should say.

On the international front his task is to calm down the anxiety about domestic terrorism in the United States while not looking like a “mini-me” version President George W. Bush. He should appear thoughtful and outline his work with our allies to enhance our world position while at the same time coming across as tough and smart. He has to pre-empt the post speech analysis by the Republicans. He can do this by anticipating with Republican leaders are going to say and by outlining steps he plans to take to address their concerns.

Finally, he must address the budget. He want to freeze discretionary spending. However, even if he gets his way (not that likely) the overall picture of Medicare and Social Security makes the freeze on discretionary spending look like a drop in the bucket. Neither party wants to take on that debt issue.                
                

            
                President Obama must tell the American people that he was elected to not just give good news but true news. He should say he wants to be remembered as the president who told America the truth. That would be a real populist message and would win him the support and the accolades of the folks in the middle, the voters who ultimately sent him to the White House in the first place.

                Watching New Jersey Governor Chris Christie twisting in the breeze, and reading a beaten down President Obama’s interview in the current New Yorker magazine, I am reminded of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's caution that in politics, as in life, ""standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous; you get knocked down by the traffic from both sides.""

                The governor and the president aspired to break out of their respective stereotypes and attract broad bipartisan support. Both, though, have been hobbled by self-inflicted wounds. Christie crashed into Bridgegate. Obama seems lost in the Matrix known as Obamacare. Both proud, powerful men are humbled by their natural enemies’ ascendant.

                In Governor Christie’s case, despite his conciliatory inaugural speech, which called for an end to divisive partisanship, it seems unlikely that the pro-life, pro-immigration reform, pro-business conservative will ever again attract the Democrats and independents that propelled him to re-election by 22 points last November.                
                

            
                Those fair weather friends are gone forever. Six of the governor’s closest aides are implicated in a series of infuriating, possibly criminal scandals including the infamous bridge closing, and progressive partisan purists are gloating, “See, I told you so; Christie’s just another right-wing bully.”

                Instead, he was muscular in hunting down al-Qaida, and he resisted attempts to stereotype his domestic agenda; ""General Motors is alive. Bin Laden is dead,"" and all that.                
                

            
                But his goal of being a leader for all the people collapsed, in part crushed by the worst website ever launched. After jamming through his national healthcare scheme without a single Republican vote, and then lying about its consequences, he’s lost the chance to be a transformative president.                
                

            
                He wanted to be regarded as a Teddy Roosevelt or Abe Lincoln; now he’s fighting to avoid going down in history as a black Franklin Pearce or Millard Fillmore.                
                

            
                Mr. Obama's worst sin in health care reform was trying to chart a middle-course between doing nothing about the uninsured, which the right preferred, and giving everybody Medicare, which he should have done if he cared about satisfying his natural allies on the left.                
                

            
                Hosting a call-in radio show as I do isn’t like running a state or a country, but it is an excellent place to understand the difficulty of moderation, and to feel the depth of emotion on the left and right. Each extreme is hyper-vigilant to bust my chops whenever they sense I’ve strayed too red or too blue.                
                

            
                Still, because compromise and conciliation are the only way to preserve ""a more perfect union,"" here is a partial program for the next generation Obama or Christie.                
                

            
                Among many other policies, the thoroughly modern moderate must,                
                

            
                1.- Embrace the domestic policies of centrist Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who warned of the consequences of the deterioration of the traditional family. To combat the malignant trend of unwed, single mothers, implement Geraldo's Law, which mandates that there be a father's name on every birth certificate. In the case of same sex marriage, which I also embrace, the law would require two parents to be named, regardless of sex.                
                

            
                2.- In fact, emphasize personal responsibility in all policies. Example: unemployment insurance must be capped at 26 weeks. Any longer than six months encourages sloth and destroys ambition. At times of national or regional economic duress, when unemployment persists above say 6 percent, extended unemployment insurance would be provided. But it would require the recipient to work for the government in some capacity that requires him or her to show up somewhere, everyday. No show, no pay.                
                

            
                3.- Proclaim that the federal minimum wage of $7.25 is obscenely low and must be raised. California's proposal to go up to $8/hour in 2014 and $10/hour in 2016 is about right. Once set, federal minimum wage must be tied to inflation.                     
                

            
                4.- Be in favor of charter schools and universal pre-K. Be against public sector strikes and ridiculously lush pensions. Everyone would be required to contribute to their own retirement accounts.                
                

            
                5.- Abolish the cap on payroll tax, which is rising this year to $117,900. Someone making $117,900 should not be paying the same total dollar amount of payroll tax that someone making $117,900,000 pays. This reform would fund Social Security indefinitely and is a Rich Man's tax that does not punish success. Also, the retirement age must be gradually increased as life expectancy continues to rise.                
                

            
                6.- Be in favor of Stop and Frisk, and other pro-active New York City-style policing. But legalize marijuana and dramatically reduce penalties for most drug use. Abolish mandatory minimum sentencing.                   
                

            
                7.- Be for vastly broadened legal immigration. It is what makes us stronger than shrinking nations like Russia and Japan. Be in favor of a broad amnesty for otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before a certain date.                
                

            
                8.- Be against the stridency of organized protest groups including the NAACP, the Tea Parties, and the militant wings of both the Gay Rights and Pro-Life movements.                
                

            
                9.- Be against the blasphemous exploitation of tragedies like Benghazi, either by Democrats looking to protect Hillary Clinton or Republicans who keep repeating the lie that we could have saved our people there, if only Barack Obama had stayed in the Situation Room that awful night.                
                

            
                10.- Be extremely reluctant to commit to large-scale foreign interventions like Afghanistan and Iraq.                
                

            
                11.- Be in favor of state-of-the-art, but reasonable, prudent intelligence gathering with judicial supervision.                
                

            
                12.- Be in favor of tax and business policies that reward enterprise and preserve capital, not crony capitalists, who are the ultimate socialists. Proclaim a partial tax amnesty for repatriated capital currently being held abroad. Keep inheritance and capital gains taxes reduced.                
                

            
                13.- Remove defense spending from legislative control. Close unnecessary military bases, like those in Germany and those in the U.S. that were built to fight Native Americans and Mexico in the 19th century. Phase out weapons programs that a panel of real war fighters deems wasteful and ineffective. Tax lobbyists. Restrict the number of lawyers graduating each year. Vastly expand medical school enrollment. Offer free medical school tuition to all doctors and other health care professionals who would then be required to work in the community for a designated period after graduation.                
                

            
                There is much more, but be warned, because this manifesto has something to anger everyone, if you embrace it you had better not stumble or, as Christie and Obama have discovered, the partisans will seek to destroy you.

                This is not a scientific poll."
"Chief Justice Roberts, please put off ObamaCare decision until 2013","Let’s be honest: The Supreme Court makes political decisions. To many, this statement is heresy. But that doesn’t make it any less true, as Professor Barry Freidman explains in his book ""The Will of the People: How Public Opinion Has Influenced the Supreme Court and Shaped the Meaning of the Constitution.""                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The two latest cases with historic, political overtones are officially referred to as case 11-393, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius and case 11-400, Florida v. The Department of HHS. These two case challenge the constitutionality of the Affordable Health Care Act, more commonly known as “ObamaCare.”                 
                

            
                Right now, the Supreme Court’s public image is at a worrisome level ; less than 30% of likely voters rating the institution excellent or good.                 
                

            
                The High Court last waded into such political thicket during a presidential campaign back in 1936. -- President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought re-election while the justices of the Supreme Court legally gutted his famed New Deal.                 
                

            
                A recent Gallup poll found an astounding 72% of Americans believed the fundamental glue to the president’s health care reform – the individual mandate – is unconstitutional.

                Besides nearly all Republicans, many Democrats and independents are also opposed to the health care law. As legendary Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes warned in his classic book ""The Common Law,"" legal decisions defying such collective wisdom threaten respect for the law.                
                

            
                So we ask: would the Supreme Court best serve America by intentionally delaying any substantive decision about the health care law until after the 2012 presidential election?                 
                

            
                This judicial sleight of hand will not be necessary should the Justices rule that the 1867 Anti-Junction Act prevents any decision before the law is fully operative in 2015.                 
                

            
                But once Chief Justice Roberts determines this is not the majority view, then he owes the Court and the country a calculated political delaying tactic.                 
                

            
                This can be easily done by quietly rounding up the votes for additional hearings after the new Supreme Court term begins on October 1. There is already a precedent for such a move. -- Justice Felix Frankfurter used a similar tactic to help win a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). And it would guarantee no decision prior to the 2012  presidential election in November.                
                

            
                The Court’s authority to rule on ObamaCare’s legality is itself a product of brilliant legal politics by Chief Justice John Marshall. The Constitution doesn’t explicitly give the Supremes power to overrule an act of Congress.                 
                

            
                When the famed case of Marbury vs. Madison (1803), reached the Supreme Court, populists aligned with President Jefferson believed Congress was superior to the Judiciary as elected lawmakers represented the people’s will.                 
                

            
                But conservative Federalists like Marshall feared Jeffersonian Democrats would abuse legislative power. They viewed the Judiciary as a co-equal check and balance. William Marbury had been appointed by Federalist President John Adams to a judicial post. But Jefferson had taken office before Marbury’s pro forma paperwork got inked. The Virginian refused to let Secretary of State James Madison sign it. The angry Federalist sued.                
                

            
                The political irony would have delighted even Machiavelli.                 
                

            
                If Jefferson’s constitutional interpretation was right – the Judiciary lacked the power to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional – then Marbury could get the Supreme Court to force the president to give him the job.                
                

            
                But if Marshall adopted the Federalist position – the Judiciary had the constitutional authority to declare federal legislation creating Marbury’s job unconstitutional – then his long-time Virginia rival would win. However, the price for defeating Marbury would be to establish the Court’s power to overrule Acts of Congress.                
                

            
                Marshall had the perfect political case to lose the battle and win the war. So he persuaded all the Justices to back Jefferson over Marbury, thus making it impossible for the president to oppose their decision!                
                

            
                Fast forward to today -- the ‘ObamaCare” case risks a bitter Supreme Court split.                 
                

            
                The dueling sides will accuse each other of shredding the Constitution. Democrats and Republicans are already gearing up for a ""scorched earth"" campaign fueled by cash unleashed by the Supreme Court with its 2010 decision in Citizens United vs the Federal Election.                 
                

            
                The Supremes need to step back. There is no pressing need for a quick decision. Let Americans first “have it out” in the presidential campaign. It is time to trust the people for a change.

Obama Has Ignored Coalition That Elected Him,"As the country finds itself the most divided it’s been in years, the man who promised to unite us is trying to patch the same coalition that propelled him into office back together as the 2010 midterm elections approach.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Obama released a video to supporters, specifically singling out ""young people, African-Americans, Latinos, and women who powered our victory in 2008.”                
                

            
                These are demographics that Obama, ever the serial campaigner, has largely ignored since taking office. As I wrote in the New York Daily News in February, “Obama…made a mistake by not interacting with the folks who propelled him into power after Nov. 3. By the time he engaged them (in February 2009), he was asking for money, not their support in pushing his agenda.”                
                

            
                They are also groups that did not make a showing in the elections in Virginia, Massachusetts and New Jersey, forcing many of us in the punditry world to question whether or not Obama be an effective tool for anyone in his party, other than himself. But it wasn’t that he just didn’t interact with these groups – one could argue he did. Between the dozens of speeches on health care and campaign-like push for his policies, his approval ratings among all Americans – including these groups – took a hit to an all-time low.                
                

            
                In short: it wasn’t that he didn’t converse with these groups, it was that he did and the message didn’t resonate.                
                

            
                The disappointment isn’t just that the president constantly has politics on the brain (most politicians do). It’s that he’s mocked other key voting blocs (tea partiers) and sidelined others (seniors, with the slashing of Medicare reimbursements in the health care reform bill) when he’s supposed to be representing everyone, not running for office yet again with a polarizing message push.                
                

            
                Now with the release of this video, if there ever was a doubt that the post-partisan age of Obama was a farce, this cements it. The man who was supposed to preside over – as he stated – not the red states or blue states but the United States, is aiming to divide us even more for political gain, sadly but unsurprisingly, one critical voting block at a time.

"Wake Up America, Your Standard of Living Is In Jeopardy!","Old-fashioned parents know how important it is to teach their children the “value of a dollar.” Uncle Sam doesn’t seem to have learned this lesson though, which has grave implications for our future standard of living.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                For most of this decade, the Federal Reserve has pursued a policy of having a “weak” dollar, a dollar that’s cheap in relation to other currencies. Current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke prevailed on former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to adopt this policy, and Bernanke is now continuing it. And if continued much longer, a weak dollar policy—combined with overspending and bad tax policy--will irreparably reduce America’s standard of living.                
                

            
                Inherent in the idea of standard of living is the level of our present and future consumption. America’s “standard of living” is generally considered a measure of how easy it is for us to satisfy our material desires. There are many ways we might look at this--how many televisions or computers we have per household, how much health care we consume on a per capita basis and how many families in our nation live below the poverty level. But however our standard of living is measured, current monetary, fiscal and tax policies will diminish it if we stay on our current path.                
                

            
                Now, clearly some people benefit from a weak dollar. Farmers and other exporters who sell abroad benefit because their products are cheaper (and thus more attractive) on world markets. But because we purchase so many more foreign goods than we export, a weak dollar policy is very bad for consumers and decreases our purchasing power.                
                

            
                Over the last 20 years, America’s appetite for foreign goods has increased multifold. And it is not that easy just to “buy American.” In many cases, there may not be an American choice in a particular product category and if there is, the “American” product may still have significant foreign content in it. This means that as the dollar weakens, our purchases of foreign goods cost much, much more. We will see our household purchasing power decline in future years as effects of the weak dollar policy filter through our economy.                
                

            
                Another effect of a weakening dollar is that investors fear holding assets in dollars. And so the steadily weakening dollar has produced capital flight from the U.S. which harms our economy, as investors seek assets denominated in other, stronger currencies. This leads to a downward spiral as dollars become less and less desirable.                
                

            
                U.S. per capita gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen over 25% since 2000 when measured in euros (a more stable gauge of value than the weak dollar), according to top Wall Street economist David Malpass. Germany’s GDP has overtaken America’s GDP on a per capita basis. And America’s standard of living relative to the rest of the world is falling off a cliff -- with President Obama’s policies giving it a two-armed push over the edge.                
                

            
                Spending plays a major role. The Obama budget also includes record shattering federal spending increases and trillion dollar annual deficits, doubling the national debt in five years, and tripling it in ten. The Administration’s own budget numbers now show total Federal debt reaching $23.3 trillion in 2019. That debt will exceed 100% of GDP by 2011, giving us the honor of the 7th highest government debt-to-GDP ratio in the world. As Judy Shelton recently reported in The Wall Street Journal, that puts us in the company of Zimbabwe, Lebanon, Singapore, Jamaica, Japan, and Italy.                
                

            
                To put our national debt in perspective -- a country cannot even join the European Union unless its government debt-to-GDP ratio does not exceed 60%. This means that even if we wanted to join the EU, our economic fundamentals may soon be seen as too weak.                
                

            
                The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that under current policies, the federal debt will climb to almost 300% of GDP by 2040. Even during World War II, the national debt peaked at 113% of GDP. This was only a temporary condition and at least we vanquished Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in return for spike in the debt. Now, huge debts are a way of life in America. Obama’s budget busters include increasing federal welfare spending by one third in just his first two years, with total welfare spending soaring to $1 trillion by 2014 and $10.3 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Heritage Foundation.                
                

            
                Consider also the effect of taxes. President Obama’s budget provides for increasing the capital gains tax rate by 33% at the start of 2011. The top federal income tax rate would also increase by almost 30% if a health care reform bill similar to the one passed by the House this weekend becomes law. These prospective tax increases on earnings in dollars would cause further capital flight, increasing the downward spiral of the dollar and our standard of living.                
                

            
                These soaring tax rates and crushing deficits will lead to a continued decline of American living standards. Based on the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s GDP and inflation assumptions, continued declines in household wealth holdings are projected from 2009 to 2014, with real U.S. per capita GDP falling to below 2000 levels. So much for the Obama recovery.                
                

            
                But the hit to our standard of living could be much worse than even these numbers show. The economy has performed substantially worse this year than was assumed in the Obama budget, with our growth lower and unemployment at a much higher level. Economists predict that these negative trends will continue in the near future. -- This means future deficits and debt will be far higher than the administration projects.

Unlike our government, Americans have drastically cut back on their discretionary spending in response to frightening economic conditions. In some cases, Americans have done this because they are unemployed and can’t afford to spend, but many others have done this out of fear of what may be to come. We may think that it is appropriate for Americans to learn to consume less. But even if we chose now voluntarily to reduce our consumption of cars, electronics and houses, we still want to be able to afford to purchase them in the future.                
                

            
                The decline of America’s standard of living can be reversed with a dramatic change in course to pro-growth economic policies. But American voters need to wake up, or face declining standards of living far into the future. While a Susan B. Anthony dollar may be larger than a euro in size, it will take change to our fiscal and monetary policies to make the value of our dollar approach that of the euro any time soon.

Obama -- The President America Needs Now,"History books will celebrate Barack Obama as one of the greatest American presidents of all time. If we’re smart, we’ll start celebrating him more now.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                President Obama created at least 800,000 jobs and as many as 2.4 million new jobs through emergency economic stimulus, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Perhaps more importantly, faced with an economic crisis of extraordinary proportions --- brought on by failed policies under Republican leadership --- President Obama put the breaks on recession and started the slow climb to recovery. According to a survey of 50 independent economists conducted by USA Today, without the actions taken by President Obama, the unemployment rate would be even higher than it is now and a dire situation would be much, much worse.                
                

            
                But that’s not all. In addition to stopping a bad short-term recession from becoming a full-blown depression, President Obama has paved the way to a better future for all of us in the long-term. Thanks to President Obama, 32 million previously-uninsured Americans now have health insurance and all of us can stop worrying about being denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.                 
                

            
                Widespread insurance industry abuses have been curbed and the rise of health care costs, while still significant in our nation, is being slowed thanks to the president’s initiative. Unlike President Bush, who pigeonholed the government into bailing out Wall Street, President Obama has extended unemployment benefits, passed mortgage relief for struggling homeowners and created new incentives for small business while reigning in Wall Street greed and corruption.                 
                

            
                Under President Obama, new financial reform laws ensure that big banks can no longer pocket exorbitant profits while passing off the costs of risks to taxpayers. And thanks to the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, our government will rightly make sure that, just like stopping bad beef from poisoning our food supply, toxic financial products won’t trick consumers and poison our economy.                
                

            
                President Obama persuaded BP to put $20 billion into a fund to help Gulf Coast residents recover from the oil spill disaster. The president invested in one of the last bastions of U.S. manufacturing --- the American auto industry --- and rescued General Motors to the point where GM is now selling public stock and repaying the government. And the president ended the War in Iraq, a war that was not only distracting us from needs here at home but contributing to the destabilization and radicalization of the region. And those are just a few of his achievements.                
                

            
                In a slow economy where big businesses are sitting on capital but still refusing to spend and hire because of stagnant demand, the only way to get the economy going is with government spending that creates jobs and puts more money in the hands of working people. Unlike President Bush, who drove up the deficit on war spending which does not stimulate our economy in the long-term, President Obama’s spending has been wisely focused not only on short-term stimulus but also long-term economic growth, which will generate budget surplus in the future and pay down the gap.                 
                

            
                At any rate, there was no such grousing about the deficit while President Bush was running it up. In a poll conducted in early 2009 about national priorities, the deficit came in sixth --- after regulating the financial industry, ending the war in Iraq and health care reform. I actually wish President Obama had done even more, just as I wish moderate Democrats in Congress had stronger spines and Republicans weren’t so addicted to obstructionism.                 
                

            
                The fact is, in this recession we’ve seen what happens when Wall Street is allowed to write its own rules and run the economy. What worked well for the big banks (profits are still up!) didn’t work well for ordinary Americans. What we’ve needed is a strong leader who understands the role of government in making our nation and our economy work for everyone, not just those at the top --- who can unite us across our differences and inspire us, together, not just to restore the American dream but make it better than ever. Thankfully, no matter how much the Tea Party pretends otherwise, that leader is Barack Obama.                
                

            
                If your family was doing well until recently, you have Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Johnson to thank -- for Social Security, Medicare, workplace safety and collective bargaining laws, home ownership incentives, improvements in public education and access to college and more.                 
                

            
                If your children do well a few decades from now, they’ll thank President Obama -- for rescuing our economy, investing in 21st century jobs and infrastructure, reigning in Wall Street abuse, making health care affordable, strengthening education and making sure that if you work hard to make America succeed, you will share a piece of that success.                 
                

            
                History will thank President Obama. Approaching the second anniversary of his election, we should all be thanking him now.

Why Tragedy Will Be Result of Dems Rush to Victory on Health Reform,"Last Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi begged, cajoled, and threatened health care legislation to a successful vote in her chamber, albeit by a razor thin margin of 220-215. The administration and House leadership touted this as a landmark vote, which it is, but only if you ignore the fact that the bill achieves almost none of President Obama's promised health reform goals. In fact, it is very likely to explode the deficit, drive up health care costs, and inflict massive new taxes on middle-class Americans.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Watching events unfold in Washington at first hand, it’s become clear that health reform has become the Democrats version of ""Moby Dick,"" as party leaders embrace the premise that they must pass something this year and declare victory, no matter how flawed the final product is. Unfortunately, they may sink the economy along the way.                
                

            
                If clearer heads prevailed, Congress would scrap these partisan bills and start over:                
                

            
                Both the House and Senate bills will cost well over $1 trillion over the next ten years. The CBO scores the Senate bill at $829 billion and the House bill at $1.055 trillion, but only because of the most transparent budget gimmicks. The Senate Budget Committee puts the fully-implemented price tag at roughly $2.5 trillion for the first decade – demolishing the president’s promise that reforms would not cost more than $900 billion.                
                

            
                The cost curve for spending gets bent…up. The CBO says spending in both bills rises at 8 percent annually as far as the eye can see and CMS actuary Richard Foster says that national health spending gets worse, not better. So much for the president’s repeated assurances that reform would slow the rate of health care inflation.                
                

            
                New entitlements plus cost growth equals taxes, and debt, debt, debt. The CBO only scores the bills as reducing the deficit because Democrats pretend that Medicare docs will get slashed by over 20 percent in two years. Reality says Congress will borrow about $240 billion for the “doc fix”. Democrats pretend they will cut over $400 billion out of Medicare through more vigorous price controls – cuts that will never live to see the light of day. Get ready for a bubble in health entitlement debt.                
                

            
                What isn’t borrowed in these plans is inflicted on drug companies, diagnostic companies, private health insurance companies, “Cadillac” health plans, and individuals and businesses that don’t buy government mandated coverage. These taxes and fees, roughly 90 percent of which fall on families making under $200,000 a year, must grow even faster (10 percent annually) to keep up with the new spending spree.                
                

            
                Private insurance: expensive or off-limits. Taxes, fees and ill-conceived insurance reforms raise the specter of double-digit premium inflation for the majority of Americans with insurance. Millions will find their policies don’t pass muster with the bill’s insurance czar, driving them to more costly policies. The rest? Fifteen million will be thrust into Medicaid as eligibility rises to 150 percent of poverty.

It’s not too late for moderates and conservatives in Congress to force Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to chart a safer, bipartisan course. Here are five fundamental, commonsense reforms that will cost less, improve health care quality, and expand coverage:                
                

            
                1. End the tax exclusion for health care and replace it with a standardized tax credit or tax deduction. Economists from (Obama adviser) Jason Furman to Martin Feldstein know that the tax exemption for employer-provided insurance is regressive (the rich benefit more), arbitrary (why tie insurance to employment?), and drives up health care inflation. End it – the largest tax break in the code – and use the proceeds to expand private insurance.                
                

            
                2. Expand existing state high-risk pools to address pre-existing conditions. Today, 35 states have high risk pools that they use to subsidize coverage for Americans who might go without coverage because they have pre-existing health conditions that make coverage very expensive or unavailable in the individual insurance market. Federal dollars should go to states that embrace model high risk pools offering affordable premiums and disease management plans that help keep beneficiaries in better health.                
                

            
                3. Create real interstate insurance competition through a transparent national market. The president and Congress talk a lot about competition. But forcing consumers to choose among three or four expensive government designed plans – bronze, silver, gold or platinum, stacking the deck in favor of public plans, and hamstringing private insurance isn’t real competition. Could we limit consumers to four choices of cars, computers, or colleges and call it competition? Congress should allow interstate sale of insurance, but mandate transparency and standardized coverage descriptions so that consumers always know what they are buying and can easily compare different coverage options.

4. End waste fraud, and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid program. Experts estimate that Medicare alone may lose up to $60 billion (about 10 percent of total spending) in fraud annually, but the government spends almost nothing on tracking and uncovering fraudulent schemes in federal health programs. Congress should switch to the best practices models use to detect fraud in the credit card industry by relying on real time algorithms to detect fraud at the point of service and stop it in its tracks.                
                

            
                5. Enact real tort reform that will end lawsuit abuse and reduce defensive medicine. Former DNC chairman Howard Dean admitted his party’s allegiance to the plaintiff’s bar precludes backing tort reform. So the president has acknowledged that lawsuits “may” drive up health care costs – but hasn’t offered any serious solutions. Bipartisan malpractice reforms do exist – from expert health courts to a “safe harbor” for doctors who embrace best practices - that could reduce lawsuit abuse. The CBO estimates that tort reform could save $54 billion over ten years.                
                

            
                Republicans and Democrats agree that health care reform is a critical issue for the nation’s future. But the Democrats have developed deeply flawed, partisan reforms that expand coverage without fixing any of the systems’ underlying problems. Unless they chart a new, bipartisan course soon their rush to declare victory will result in a national tragedy.

Top 5 Business Blunders of 2010,"Although 2010 won’t be remembered for colossal corporate bankruptcies or bailouts, the year still saw its fair share of business failures, many due to self-inflicted wounds. My Top 5 Business Blunders includes businesses that, through every fault of their own, have failed to remember and implement core business principles.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                5. United States Postal Service: A Failure of Management –It might seem unfair to start the list with a government bureaucracy. However, the USPS is that rare government bureaucracy that performs a valuable business service (as opposed to an administrative service) for everyone and doesn’t receive any tax revenue to operate. In other words, the USPS is supposed to function like a business.                
                

            
                Facing both technological and competitive obstacles, the USPS lost $8.5 billion in 2010. Part of the problem is that the USPS has 535 CEOs, otherwise known as Congress, who stymie any serious structural reform. But the USPS is also burdened with outdated procedures, infrastructure and staffing that fail to focus on real customer needs.                
                

            
                4. Egg Recall: A Supply-Chain Breakdown -- Following the largest egg recall in history, many consumers were left wondering how and where the breakdown occurred. Somewhere from Point A to Point B the eggs allegedly became infected by contaminated feed from a supplier, unnoticed by the company’s quality processes.                
                

            
                Supply chain failures occur for many reasons: cost, complacency, relying on past practices, and focusing on the wrong metrics. Instead of treating the supply chain as an integrated process in their overall production line, businesses fall back on faulty performance metrics that don't lead to a better or more consistent product.                
                

            
                3. Toyota Recall: A Failure of Design -- The Toyota recall shares a major characteristic with the egg recall: supply-chain breakdown. Subsequent investigations, however, revealed that a major contributing cause were design issues that led to consumer error. The fault still rests with Toyota, who failed recognize the design issue, even when faced with consumer complaints.                
                

            
                The lesson for businesses is that keeping the lines of communication open between the consumer and management is almost as important as ensuring you’re building a safe product. If a product is only safe under certain specific conditions, but becomes dangerous under others, it’s back to the drawing board.                
                

            
                2. Health Care Reform: A Failure to Define Goals and Test – No, it’s not a business. But the law’s unfavorable approval ratings stem in part from its authors’ inability to articulate a clear purpose, thus holding an important message for business. Like any major company initiative, unless you’re clear on your goal, those tasked with developing and implementing the reform will fail to deliver. That’s precisely what happened with “Obamacare.”                
                

            
                This is good lesson for any CEO. The administration was never able to succinctly explain the reason behind the massive reform. Was it to reduce healthcare costs? Was it to insure more people? Was it to improve the quality of care? The administration made the case on all three fronts, leading to mass confusion with the public -- the customers. And the massive initiative is being implemented without any beta testing on a limited scale.                 
                

            
                Relying on pie in the sky promises to dramatically change a functioning system, even one that admittedly needs improvement, without any ramp-up or implementation testing on a small scale is a recipe for disaster. If you set politics aside, and look at the health care reform from the perspective of a business, it’s a great example of how not to implement transformational change.                
                

            
                1. BP Oil Spill: A Failure of Leadership and Metrics: The Deep Horizon oil rig explosion is clearly the biggest business blunder of 2010. At the most basic level, BP suffered from a failure to balance competing objectives. Tony Hayward began as BP's CEO in May 2007 with a promise to focus ""like a laser"" on safety concerns, as well as operating performance. The metaphor proved to be all too apt: A laser can focus on only one thing at a time. It appears that BP failed to focus on the right target.                
                

            
                What's likely is that BP's management believed they were meeting all safety performance targets, or at least gaining on them, because they were spending millions of dollars to improve safety. By the metrics they had created, the company might well have been making progress. The metrics they chose were the problem. The point for all businesses is that making safety a priority and throwing resources at it without appropriate metrics may lead to very bad outcomes.

Why some Democrats are turning on Obama,"Last week the three most powerful Democrats in the state of West Virginia — Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, Senator Joe Manchin and Rep. Nick Rahall – made a public display of turning their backs on President Obama by announcing plans to skip the Democratic National Convention.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The president lost West Virginia in 2008 and his polling there remains weak. So local Democrats have decided they have no problem embarrassing the man whose name will be on the top of their ticket in November.                
                

            
                The same political distancing act is on display in Pennsylvania’s 12th congressional district. Conservative Democrat Mark Critz also says he has better things to do than go to the convention. Rep. Critz said he will be working in his district instead of  “focusing on the agendas of the political parties.”                
                

            
                In the harsh, polarized world of Washington politics, Republicans take delight in opposing every legislative proposal from President Obama.                
                

            
                But when the history of Obama’s first term is written, conservative Democrats will also be remembered for regularly throwing wrenches into any plans coming from this president.                
                

            
                The conservative Democrats — mostly elected from swing states in the anti-President George W. Bush wave elections of 2006 and 2008 — gave the president headaches even when Democrats controlled the House and Senate.                
                

            
                The best example was the fight over health care reform.                
                

            
                Republicans did not give the president a single vote despite a plan that followed previous GOP proposals — most notably Mitt Romney’s Massachusetts law — and excludes a public option for insurance. That left the president in need of every Democrat’s vote. Note that liberal Democrats who wanted a public option did not abandon the president.                
                

            
                But those conservative Democrats squeezed the Obama Team for concessions and amendments that allowed Republican critics to disparage the negotiations as “Chicago-style” bribery used to win support for a bad proposal.                
                

            
                Words and phrases such as  “kickbacks” and “sausage making” became associated with healthcare reform. And they became Republican talking points that drove down public support for the healthcare deal even as most Americans praised the individual changes the bill achieved.                
                

            
                The president again had trouble with conservative Democrats in April when he said he would veto any transportation bill that included the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. Conservative Democrats walked out on the president when 69 of them joined the GOP to vote legislation that included the oil sands pipeline.                
                

            
                And in the last week, seven conservative Senate Democrats undercut the president’s negotiations with Republicans over a budget deal. They have declined to adopt the president’s negotiating position against another extension of the Bush-era income tax rates.                
                

            
                The move weakens Obama in negotiations with the GOP.                
                

            
                A weak presidential candidate at the top of the ticket does not usually help anyone on the ticket. But in this election cycle conservative Democrats obviously see their political fortunes as separate from Obama’s.                
                

            
                One of those conservative Democrats, Sen. Claire McCaskill, is locked in a tough reelection fight in Missouri, a state Obama lost in 2008. In addition to backing away from the president on the budget deal, she is also backing away on immigration policy changes allowing young illegal immigrants in high school or the military to avoid deportation.                
                

            
                “My preference would be for Congress to resolve this issue …,” McCaskill said. “I’ll be looking at the details of this announcement closely to ensure it isn’t a magnet for illegal immigration.”                
                

            
                McCaskill is distancing herself from the president in the hope of persuading swing voters that she is more of an independent than a Democrat.                
                

            
                A Rasmussen poll taken earlier this month found McCaskill losing to her likely GOP opponent by 12 points. McCaskill needs independent voters and she does not see the Obama brand helping her cause.                
                

            
                From the Obama campaign’s perspective, the conservative Democrats’ strategy is damaging.                
                

            
                Obama also wants to win over independents. He could use conservative Democrats as allies.                
                

            
                The result is the White House never punishes the turncoats.                
                

            
                The Obama campaign is too busy energizing its liberal base right now with support for gay marriage, the new immigration policy and preventing student loans from skyrocketing. Those policies may be enough punishment for Democrats seeking socially-conservative independent voters.                
                

            
                The real question for conservative Democrats now is whether any voters will think they are not actually Democrats because of stunts such as avoiding  the national convention.                
                

            
                In Pennsylvania’s 12th District, the campaign manager for Rep. Critz’s Republican opponent doubts skipping the Charlotte convention will do it.                
                

            
                Rep. Critz “can run from President Obama all he wants …,” said Jon Raso. “This is just the latest ploy … to distance himself from the president in desperation of saving his political career.”                
                

            
                Maybe Obama will throw a wrench in Critz’s plan by endorsing him.

Don't Be Fooled -- Senate Health Bill Includes Taxpayer Funding of Abortion,"For almost 35 years, the law of the land has been an explicit prohibition against federal taxpayer dollars being used to pay for elective abortions, known as the Hyde amendment, after the late great Illinois congressman. This is a policy supported by the majority of the American people.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In fact, this hard-fought explicit ban was included in the health care bill that passed the House last year. Regrettably, the Senate did not follow suit and instead passed a bill that would allow hard-earned taxpayer dollars to pay for elective abortion. That is a simple fact. Unfortunately, in a mad rush to secure enough votes, leading House Democrats now intend to take up the Senate-passed bill, arguing that the Senate language prohibits federal funding of abortion. Besides that fact that this simply not true, it also demonstrates the lengths the president and his allies will take to pass this bill against the will of the American people.                
                

            
                Just this week, Cardinal Francis George, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, issued a statement saying, “Notwithstanding the denials and explanations of its supporters, and unlike the bill approved by the House of Representatives in November, the Senate bill deliberately excludes the language of the Hyde amendment. It expands federal funding and the role of the federal government in the provision of abortion procedures.”                
                

            
                First, the Senate bill allows elective abortions to be offered through the newly-created individual state health insurance exchanges and multi-state health plans administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and through federally-subsidized plans in already-existing community health centers.                
                

            
                Second, there is nothing in this legislation that requires any of these programs to live up to both the spirit and letter of the Hyde amendment that Congress has included each year in spending bills that fund the government. This not only prevents federal funding of elective abortions, but also erects an iron-clad firewall against any private money for abortion being mixed with any federal or state health program receiving federal dollars. This applies, for example, to Medicaid, a health program for the economically disadvantaged that is funded by both federal and state governments. If any resources are used for elective abortions that money must be kept completely separate from Medicaid. This is sound policy that must be maintained.                
                

            
                Regrettably, the Senate-passed bill doesn’t include this firewall. Anyone who doesn’t earn enough money would qualify for a federal subsidy to help pay for their health plan in the state exchanges, including plans offering elective abortion coverage. Some argue that under the Senate-passed bill, federal funding would be “segregated” so no federal money would pay for abortions. But this is a violation of the Hyde amendment, which also prevents the federal funding of insurance that covers elective abortion.                
                

            
                Furthermore, it is entirely possible that there would only be one health plan in any given state that does not include elective abortion. And even if you are opposed, you may well be railroaded into choosing a plan that covers it, because you might be looking for the best plan to treat a sick child or your own health condition.                
                

            
                What’s more, passing a new state law is the only way an individual state could truly ensure that elective abortions are not included in the plans offered through a state insurance exchange. That would be easier in some states than in others, but that’s unfair to those who are morally opposed to federal funding of abortion and happen to live in states where passing such a law would be extremely difficult.                
                

            
                Lastly, under this proposal, community health centers would receive a dedicated stream of money outside the annual congressional process to fund the government which is where the Hyde prohibition is maintained. So that means that for the first time federal money could be used to fund abortion at a community health center.                
                

            
                Those are the facts, and anyone who thinks the Senate abortion language is strong enough should think again. That is because, regardless of one’s position on this controversial issue, it is entirely reasonable to expect that a person who is fundamentally and morally opposed to abortion should not have to sanction its use with their hard-earned tax payer dollars.

Trying to Prop Up the GOP by Scaring Americans,"How is it that coverage of the health care reform debate has now moved off the front pages of two of our country's major newspapers and has been reduced to nothing more than a brief summation in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times? With health care accounting for somewhere between one sixth and one seventh of our total economy, a weekend of Senators debating reform and the topic front and center as one of the major concerns cited by voters, it is amazing that the story is not at the top of the headlines. It is, however, one of the hot topics on talk radio debate and with the American public.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Headlines or not the president paid an unusual visit to Capitol Hill to help facilitate a compromise on the public option. Republicans are throwing concerns about the public option around as if it was a replay of ""The Communist Manifesto."" And at the same time they are going after the Democrats for trying to streamline Medicare. Those Republicans are made up of the same genetic material as the naysayers who were opposed to Medicare in 1965. Their debate this weekend was laughable for its hypocrisy. They are saying that granny is going to suffer by cutting $500 billion out of the Medicare budget. But the facts are different.                
                

            
                The cost savings from Medicare will be achieved by creating an annual wellness benefit, providing free preventive benefits and covering the much famed ""doughnut hole"" which was a gap in drug coverage. For those of us are coming round the age corner this makes all the sense in the world. Having lost over 40 pounds in the last several years ( I am 4'10"") I am already saving my insurance company thousands. After my weight loss, my blood pressure went to perfect and my cholesterol level went down considerably. These are the kind of savings these Medicare prevention initiatives can make. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and Senator Grassley and Senator Judd Gregg among others are just trying to torpedo any real change in health care, they are doing this to scare the American public and help get more Republicans elected in the Senate.                
                

            
                That this stance is sour grapes on the part of Republicans was evident when Senator Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) said in a conference call "" If we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo (the defeat of Napoleon)."" -- The Republicans are saying that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) numbers are wrong and they've offered up their own study of the numbers. The Democrats have a study (from the Center for American Progress) showing there are going to be greater cost savings than the Congressional Budget Office ""scoring"" shows.With two studies showing a total health care savings and one that says it will cost more I'll go with the CBO figures. The cost savings make sense in a streamlined health care system with computerized medical records and prevention initiatives.                
                

            
                The other area being floated is the so-called ""public option."" When asked by pollsters most Americans say they want the same kind of terrific coverage that members of Congress get. This weekend a proposal was made that would include private insurers in part of the public option. With a public option that includes the private insurers it would not look like ""socialized"" health care and everyone -- including the health care lobby would wind up getting a piece of the pie. This needs to be considered and it would do an end run around the majority of Republicans whose main objective is to deep six health care for the benefit of their party rather than the American citizen.

The Art of Economics,"Like any field, economics has its trends and fads. Recently, Keynesian economics has been in vogue. Based on the work of British economist John Maynard Keynes, Keynesian economics urge governments to increase their spending and to stabilize the economy in crisis periods. The Obama administration has tried to explain its response to the current financial crisis in terms of the application of Keynesian principles. But as many conclude that our government’s responses have been flawed as well as expensive, it’s time to listen to the advice of another major 20th century economist—Arthur Laffer.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                If most Americans have heard of Arthur Laffer at all, it’s probably because of the Laffer Curve, a simple chart that shows that raising tax rates does not necessarily produce greater tax revenues. Laffer first demonstrated the idea to the White House during the Ford Administration; later, it became famous as the idea behind the Kemp-Roth tax cuts that fueled the tremendous economic boom of the Reagan years.                
                

            
                Laffer is one of the most important 20th century economists, but his greatest work may actually be in the 21st century. That’s because he is warning us now that if America doesn’t change its economic course, quickly, we are in for bad times ahead.                
                

            
                To explain, Laffer looks to a few simple axioms on which the field of economics is based – rules that predict how both economies and individuals will behave when faced with a set of choices. For instance, the law of supply and demand explains a great deal of how the economy works – when demand for a particular good increases, supply and demand will eventually equilibrate at a new equilibrium price and quantity.                
                

            
                Right now, Laffer warns that simple economic principles are pointing to a potential macroeconomic meltdown.                
                

            
                First, government borrowing continues at alarming rates. The federal budget deficit is expected to top $1.5 trillion this year, even exceeding last year’s staggering deficit of $1.4 trillion, and Congress recently expanded the national debt ceiling by a similar amount. Federal spending on bank and auto bailouts and stimulus all adds up. All this spending must be financed somehow, and the patience of our Chinese, Japanese, and Arab creditors may one day run out.                
                

            
                Laffer’s second point is that the supply of money continues to grow. The monetary base, which is the narrowest measure of the money supply or total amount of money in the economy at a particular point in time, has just reached an all time high. Left unchecked, the high supply of money could fuel inflation. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve is caught in a Catch 22—if they decide to fight inflation they will have to sell about $1 trillion worth of government bonds alongside a Treasury auctioning off record amounts of bonds to finance record deficits. Given the fiscal backdrop, were the Fed to go from being a huge net purchaser of bonds in 2009 to a big net seller in 2010, interest rates would be sure to rise drastically, pushing the economy into recession yet again.

Laffer’s third point is that taxes are high and likely to go up from here. Our corporate taxes are already the second-highest among the advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. For individuals, the Bush tax cuts expire next year, which will send personal income tax rates, dividend and capital gains tax rates, and estate tax rates higher. Unless Congress passes another fix, the sharply higher Alternative Minimum Tax will snare millions of middle-class taxpayers, instead of the uber-wealthy it was originally designed to target. And that doesn’t even count proposed tax increases in relation to health care reform or climate change legislation. As the incentives to work, save, and invest are all decreased via increased marginal tax rates, economic growth is sure to suffer.                
                

            
                Finally, Laffer points to trade issues. Rather than opening ourselves to trade with the world, we are increasingly cutting ourselves off from it. It’s a basic principle of economics that trade benefits both parties to a transaction, but rather than seeking to negotiate trade agreements with countries around the world, we are not ratifying the ones we have negotiated, and we’re imposing tariffs on China – the very country we need to finance our budget deficit! Open trade will help us move toward the jobs of the future rather than inefficiently seeking to hold on to the jobs of the past.                
                

            
                Laffer is right: no economy can long prosper if it is overspending, increasing tax rates, printing too much money, restricting trade, and increasing regulations. It’s simple, really – but the potential consequences if we don’t change economic course soon could be profound. So the Lafferian response to the economic crisis is simply to take the opposite track and embrace pro-growth economic policies: reform the tax system by moving toward a broad-based, low flat-tax; address the looming unfunded liabilities crisis; decrease the size and cost of government; reinstate a sound and stable money; support free trade for all; and repeal ill-conceived regulations. By turning away from Keynes and toward Laffer, America can begin to grow again and we can all recover.

A Democrat's Advice for Both Parties,"This weekend's health care debate in the House of Representatives underscored the deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans on the issue. There were legitimate fundamental and philosophical differences on both sides that were expressed, for the most part, in a civil manner.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                If you leave out the excessive rhetoric from the extremes of both parties there was a remarkable degree of agreement on many issues. As Nancy Pelosi pointed out, despite receiving not a single GOP vote, the bill had incorporated over 200 Republican amendments in the final package.                
                

            
                The public, the press, and certainly the politicians need a break from the excessive rhetoric of the past year. Health care reform will shortly be the law of the land and the public needs time -- away from partisan rhetoric -- to determine how the new law affects them and their families.                
                

            
                To my friends on the left I strongly suggest that a degree of humility is in order. We have fought for decades for yesterday's success. But we need to be mindful that many other Americans fought just as hard to defeat universal health care. It would be in our best interest not to gloat over the outcome.                
                

            
                That said I cannot ignore the outrageous behavior of the tea party activists in Washington over the weekend. When it comes to hurling racial epithets at Rep. John Lewis, one of the greatest of our country's civil rights activists, I fully expected Congressional Republicans to repudiate these thugs.                
                

            
                To my dismay there were some Republican members who actually tried to justify this blatant racism. Couple that with the idiot GOP member, Rep. Randy Neaugebauer (R-TX) who yelled out ""it's baby killer"" -- referring to the bill -- when Rep. Bart Stupak was speaking (although he has since apologized) and you have one of the most disgraceful performances in the history of the House.                
                

            
                While I reiterate my call to health care supporters to keep their powder dry, I strongly suggest John Boehner and the GOP house leadership get their extremist members back to the zoo where they clearly belong.

"Rep. Michael Burgess, MD: Why I am optimistic about health care reform in the new Congress","(Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Twenty-two years ago, the “Contract with America” promised voters that, if elected to Congress, Republicans would advance legislation to shrink the size of government, balance the budget, and reform major entitlement programs.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Americans voiced decisive support for these conservative principles at the polls in the 1994 election—Republicans won control of the House and the Senate, and Republican governors held 31 states.                
                

            
                Congress was acutely aware of the people’s desire to return to a limited federal government, and sought to start by empowering the states. As reported in the New York Times, incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich astutely observed at the start of the 104th Session, “[t]he governors are prepared to say to us if we will radically decentralize, give them the job, they will do the job.”                 
                

            
                Within one year, the Republican Congress delivered on its promise to reform the broken welfare system. As with all major legislation that has stood the test of time, welfare reform took shape on a bipartisan basis and the governors played a lead role in identifying the problems and constructing the solutions.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, the tactics employed by the Obama administration leading up to passage of the ACA stand in stark contrast to the reforms accomplished under the Contract with America.                 
                

            
                From a position inside Congress, I had a front row seat as a brand new Democratic president and a Democratically-controlled Congress went about overhauling health care behind closed doors, along party lines, and without state input. Even as Republicans were completely shut out of the process I recall thinking, where are the governors? Why are state legislatures not involved in the discussion?                
                

            
                In the years that followed, our health care system has been plagued with problems. Patients have fewer choices and burdensome mandates, consumer costs continue to spike, and 30 million Americans remain uninsured. In 2016, House Speaker Paul Ryan convened Republican members to develop an alternative way to fix our broken health care system—A Better Way.                 
                

            
                Just as they did in the 1994 election, Americans made their dissatisfaction with the status quo clear at the voting booth, and Republicans will control the White House, House, and Senate in 2017.                
                

            
                As the 115th Congress prepares to make good on its promise to deliver a Better Way to the American people, there is understandable anxiety driven by uncertainty—will the ACA be replaced? Will Medicaid be reformed? Will Medicare remain the same? These are all important questions, but I urge the American people to take heart.                 
                

            
                I am confident that the new Congress will advance legislation through an open and inclusive process to empower states, patients, taxpayers, doctors, nurses, hospitals, and insurers to participate in discussions that so profoundly affect their lives.                 
                

            
                Republicans are already taking steps to do just this. Over the past year, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee have been acquiring a deeper understanding of the challenges in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Task Force.                 
                

            
                On December 2, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and several Committee Chairmen sent a letter to state governors and insurance commissioners requesting ideas for how to reform our health care system for the benefit of the American people. On December 13, Senate Finance Committee Republicans sent a letter to governors seeking input on potential changes to health care, and announcing a roundtable on the Medicaid program in early January.                
                

            
                In many ways I see the new Congress as the rescue squad—the first responders for citizens damaged and endangered by the excesses of this experiment in nationalizing health care. But the good news is we don’t have to do it alone.                 
                

            
                By taking a page out of former Speaker Gingrich’s playbook from over 20 years ago, we can leverage the power of the state and local governments, “those laboratories of democracy,” as a force multiplier and ally to correct the errors of the past eight years.

                As lies go, this one should be setting off alarms. But except for a Washington Post rebuke, it only raised a few eyebrows. That could be a sign of how many Americans expect routine dishonesty from politicians, including President Obama.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The issue involves the medical care of his late mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. In arguing for health care reform, Obama said in a 2008 debate that, “For my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they’re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don’t have to pay her treatment, there’s something fundamentally wrong about that.”                
                

            
                It’s a touching story, and untrue.                 
                

            
                A biographer later revealed that the dispute was over disability insurance, not medical coverage or care. And Obama must have known that because he was his mother’s lawyer, and the White House didn’t dispute the biographer.                
                

            
                Yet the story, largely as Obama first told it, has reappeared in “The Road We’ve Traveled,” his campaign’s 17-minute infomercial. As the Post describes it, the video stitches together vague statements from narrator Tom Hanks and First Lady Michelle Obama to make it seem as if the president’s mother died arguing with insurance companies over coverage.                
                

            
                “The impression left by the film is very similar to Obama’s 2008 campaign rhetoric,” the paper’s Fact Checker column concludes. It calls the sequence “misleading” and awards the video three Pinocchios, out of a possible four.                
                

            
                That’s our president, folks, for whom the end always justifies the means.

              As the end of President Trump’s first year in office nears, Republicans are desperate for a victory. Following their failure to pass health care reform, polling shows they trail Democrats by nine percentage points in a generic 2018 House race. The GOP has one last hope to save its first year agenda: passing middle class and small business tax cuts.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Recent Gallup polling shows “significant” middle class tax cuts are supported by a sizable majority of Americans. For good reason. Too many hardworking taxpayers struggle to make ends meet. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Despite modest recent improvement, median wages have stagnated for most of this century. New survey data shows that four out of five full time employees are living paycheck-to-paycheck. 
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              A recent Federal Reserve report finds that nearly half of Americans could not cover an unexpected $400 expense like a car repair or home appliance replacement. Meanwhile, health care, housing, and child care costs have skyrocketed. A tax cut is the most direct way to boost wages and provide these families some relief.  
 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A tax cut for American small businesses, over which the economic recovery has largely passed, would do just as much good. It would allow small businesses to keep more of their earnings, reversing their decades-long decline and reinvigorating Main Streets in communities across the country. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Consider the results of a recent Job Creators Network nationwide poll of small business owners: Most respondents said they would reinvest their tax cut savings in the form of employee wage hikes, new hires, and expansion.  
  
 This suggests a tax cut could address the problem of stagnating wages twice. First, by directly giving all hardworking taxpayers an immediate raise in their take home pay. Second, by allowing small business employers the funds to provide a pay raise.  
  
 Whether your politics are left, right, or center, this is something we can all agree on: More money in more Americans’ pockets is a good thing for everyone.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              More money in our communities and less shipped off to Washington D.C. would produce a major economic stimulus, helping the country get back to its historic economic growth rate above three percent. This economic growth would help offset the fiscal costs of a tax cut. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Americans have shouldered the costs of out-of-control Capitol Hill spending for too long. But rather than cut costs, Washington keeps hitting withdraw, withdraw, withdraw. The government treats taxpayer wages like a Take-a-Penny tray.  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In order to highlight the substantial benefits of a tax cut for American small businesses, families, and communities, my organization, Job Creators Network, is launching a major tax cut campaign, which includes a nationwide bus tour with a rally stop at the IRS building in Washington D.C. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The message is simple: Pass a tax cut retroactive to January 1st and give working and middle class Americans a bigger paycheck by returning some of the money the government took from them last year – hundreds of dollars a month – to their wallets today.   
 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Think of what a family of four could do with a few hundred extra dollars: cover unexpected expenses, keep up with out-of-control health care costs, buffer savings accounts, or even take a well-deserved vacation. And think of what a small business could do: raise wages for loyal employees, hire some weekend help, expand into new product lines, or give back to the community. It’s their money. They earned it. They should have the final say on how to spend it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s time for Congress to come together and deliver results that actually matter at the dinner table. To recognize what hardworking taxpayers plainly need and deserve. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We’re not asking for a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code. We’re not asking for a once-in-a-generation, bipartisan omnibus reform package. We’re asking for a simple, one-time tax cut that puts a few extra dollars back in people’s pockets in time for the holidays. By next year, it will be too late

"The Incredible, Shrinking GOP Presidential Race","The 2012 GOP field just got smaller. The disappointment among Republican voters looking for a candidate to stir them and the reluctance of so many real political stars to get in the race remains the most telling aspect of the strangest year yet in national Republican politics.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In the history of modern Republican presidential politics this year will go down as the year best described by that silly 1960's song “Please, General Custer, I don’t want to go.” And this they don't want to go to Iowa.
None of the big names wants to get into the race. None of the big money has picked a candidate and given them momentum. And the split between social conservatives and fiscal conservatives has the lackluster entries currently in the race fearful that they won’t be able to unite the party.                
                

            
                Iowa’s Republican Governor, Terry Branstad, gave testimony to the painfully slow start to the big GOP race this week when he publicly pleaded for possible candidates to please come visit his state where the caucuses will mark the start of actual vote counting in less than nine months.                
                

            
                “This is a state where you can effectively launch a campaign and it is not too late,” the governor said. He later added: “I want to welcome all current and potential 2012 presidential candidates to campaign here."" The lack of presidential candidates in the state has the governor and other Republicans worried that Iowa’s traditional moment as the focus of national politics is in jeopardy. New Hampshire, the site of the first state primary, is hoping to capitalize on Iowa’s lackluster caucus but at the moment they look to be in line for more of Iowa’s disappointment with reluctant candidates standing around while relatively unknown candidates stir apathy.                
                

            
                According to an Associated Press-Gfk poll from last week, 45% of Republican primary voters are dissatisfied with the current crop of candidates. That number is up from 33% just two months ago. Since then, the biggest news has been that two relatively big names have dropped out. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and the one and only Donald Trump announced that they will not run, preferring to remain with their television shows -- Huckabee on Fox News and Trump with NBC’s ""The Apprentice.""                
                

            
                Huckabee’s departure creates the biggest opening in the field. He won the Iowa caucuses in 2008 with an impressive 34% of the vote and was a favorite of the evangelical conservative caucus-goers. The Baptist minister’s supporters in Iowa are shopping for a socially conservative candidate to carry their banner. Rightwing firebrands like Herman Cain and Rick Santorum are in the race but have not shown evidence of benefiting from Gov. Huckabee’s decision to bow out.                
                

            
                That creates a big opportunity for Rep. Michele Bachmann. The congresswoman, who heads the Tea Party caucus in the House, this week organized 128 thousand phone calls to Iowa Republicans and she continues to surprise with her ability as a fundraiser. She claims to have made 20,000 new friends on Facebook since Gov. Huckabee took a bye.                
                

            
                However, in what can be interpreted as a warning to Rep. Bachmann and other social conservatives, Gov. Branstad has advised culture-wars-conservatives to focus on “cleaning up the economy,” rather than pandering to the social conservative voting bloc.                
                

            
                The current national frontrunner for the nomination, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, has a history of trouble with Iowa Republicans. In 2008, Mitt Romney finished second with only 25%, despite spending a lot of time and millions of dollars of his own personal fortune. Romney could not close the deal with Iowa’s Republicans then and he did not yet have the millstone of the Romney health care plan around his neck – the model for the health care plan that the far right detests, President Obama’s health care reform program.                
                

            
                In a scathing editorial, the Wall Street Journal recently pilloried Romney: “More immediately for his Republican candidacy, the debate over ObamaCare and the larger entitlement state may be the central question of the 2012 election. On that question, Mr. Romney is compromised and not credible.”                
                

            
                Another well-known Republican who is less and less comfortable in Iowa is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He managed to put himself at odds with the conservative base of the party when he blasted Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals for Medicare as “rightwing social engineering.”                
                

            
                Conservative commentators in Iowa but also on national talk radio shows, on The Journal’s editorial page and all over conservative sites on the Internet have since been scathing in charging that Gingrich’s comment weakened his candidacy as well as the entire Party’s effort to build a case against President Obama.                
                

            
                Still waiting in the wings are former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, current Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels and former U.S. envoy to China Jon Huntsman. Any or all of them could radically change the race with their entrance.                
                

            
                Most conservatives would still like to see New Jersey Governor Chris Christie throw his hat in the ring. Gov. Branstad has praised him as a “rock star” and earlier this month prominent Iowa GOP donors flew to Trenton to persuade Christie to run. Any of the other candidates will be a disappointing second choice.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, the Party establishment is increasingly embracing the possibility of a run by Gov. Daniels. But his earlier statement of distaste for highlighting social conservatism is not likely to play well in Iowa. His recent attacks on Planned Parenthood seem an expedient – some may say cheap -- political attempt to paper over that problem. But the Indiana governor knows his earlier statements and his personal story will make Iowa a tough run for him.                
                

            
                No one wants to say it out loud but at the moment the polls indicate that whoever wins the GOP nomination will probably go on to lose to President Obama in the general election. The best minds in the party say an election that is a referendum on the president is the best chance for a Republican upset. Those top GOP thinkers are looking for a steady, reasonable candidate to stand there while the focus turns to the less than overwhelming approval of President Obama.                
                

            
                The problem with that strategy is finding a steady, reliable candidate who is trusted by the Republican establishment but also fiery enough to win the support of social conservatives and Tea Party activists. That person has yet to make an appearance in Iowa or other place.                
                

            
                The disappointment among Republican voters looking for a candidate to stir them and the reluctance of so many real stars – notably Gov. Christie, Rep. Ryan, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – remains the most telling aspect of the strangest year yet in national Republican politics.                
                

            
                Somewhere, Obama advisers David Plouffe and David Axelrod are smiling and singing a smug, mocking version of that song “Please Mr. Custer, I Don’t Want to Go.”

MIKE BAKER's 'The People's Weekly Brief' -- 10 Lessons Learned,"Many loyal readers of the PWB have been asking why we haven’t been publishing our weekly column for the past several months. Frankly, we ran out of things to talk about. Seriously. So instead of coming up with any old crap just for the sake of consistency, we took a vote around the PWB offices and the decision was… quit yapping until I felt like we’d restocked the pantry.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As part of the agreement to shut up for a while, I told the staff and interns that there would be no layoffs. The interns were kept busy on research projects sponsored by secretive elements of the War Department while Ms. Beasley, our marginally effective office manager, spent her time updating the PWB Christmas Card list and decorating for the holidays. Bobo the talking intern decided to apply for a White House Press credential, basically because I bet him a large pizza that there was no way in hell the White House would issue someone named Bobo a pass.                
                

            
                I then retired to the back booth at Buzzy’s Pool Room and Tavern to watch life pass by. You can learn a lot about what ails us by spending time in an establishment that sports a pool table, jars of pickled eggs and a payphone that still works.                
                

            
                My Dad used to say that the most valuable skill a man could have was the ability to shut up and listen. I went to Buzzy’s to shut up and listen. Here’s what I learned:                
                

            
                Lesson 1. I actually like a few drops of vermouth in my martini. Frankly, if you don’t add any vermouth at all, it’s a glass of gin. If you want a dry martini, ask the barman for a cold glass of gin. Don’t be pretentious.                
                

            
                Lesson 2. The only people in America this past year who thought that what Americans really, really wanted more than anything else was sweeping health care reform were the elitist liberals in the White House and on Capitol Hill. Oh, and the caustic commentators on MSNBC. My scientific survey of Buzzy’s patrons showed that for every mention of health care there were seven references to jobs.                
                

            
                Lesson 3. You had to be a complete wanker not to understand during the course of 2009 that what Americans really, really wanted more than anything else was a focus on strengthening the economy and creating jobs.                
                

            
                Lesson 4. Americans are much smarter than the politicians on both sides of the aisle give them credit for. Not necessarily book smarts, but street smarts. It may take a lengthy presidential campaign and an election and maybe a few months of governing, but eventually most Americans will spot the shell game.                
                

            
                Lesson 5. There are few things that piss Americans off more than being treated in a condescending manner by a politician regardless of political stripe.                
                

            
                Lesson 6. Term limits are viewed as a good idea by everyone except elected officials, special interest groups, lobbyists and anyone who has a vested interest in keeping the same officials in control of key committees for decades at a time. What a load of crap.                
                

            
                Lesson 7. The Tea Party movement isn’t a political movement, it’s simply anti-establishment. It’s a “Stick It to the Man” t-shirt paired with khakis and comfy shoes. One day the man is a Democrat, one day he’s a Republican. You can’t build a viable 3rd party on that platform.                
                

            
                Lesson 8. Until the attempted Christmas Day terrorist attack, no one at Buzzy’s had ever used the words “exploding” and “underpants” in the same sentence.                
                

            
                Lesson 9. The majority of patrons surveyed while drinking and shooting pool don’t actually believe it is the government’s job to go overseas and nation build in an effort to create stable, possibly democratic societies. I don’t know if the drinking and/or pool playing influences this negative view of nation building but we have commissioned a national survey by the Fenster-Speewak Institute to identify any possible correlation.                
                

            
                Lesson 10. Never bet against someone named Bobo. He arrived at the office yesterday proudly sporting his new White House press credential. Next week’s column will include his coverage of the latest press briefings from Washington.                
                

            
                Finally, ponder this thought… how many of today’s gripes directed at our politicians and government excesses could be addressed if we would grow a pair and find a way as a nation to insist on term limits? You think our founding fathers intended someone to go to Congress and stay there for 36 years? How stupid are we that we go along with sending people to Congress who then spend at least fifty percent of each two year term working to get re-elected and before you know it they’ve made a career out of being an elected official. The founding fathers would’ve hurled at the notion of a career politician.                
                

            
                We should be sending people to Congress for a maximum of two four-year terms, and the Senate for a maximum of two six-year terms. Then get the hell out of Washington and go back to work. Some folks against the idea of term limits (see Lesson 6 above) argue that “…my God, you can’t learn how Washington works in a couple years… it’s complicated and you need time to understand the complexities of legislating and being an elected official and hey, can I blow some more smoke up your kiester?” Really? Here’s what I think… If you can’t figure out how to be a Congressman or Senator inside of six months then you’re too stupid to be an elected official. To quote Ben Franklin, it ain’t rocket science.                
                

            
                Now frankly, term limits aren’t enough. The second prong in my two prong attack against the status quo is to significantly reduce the financial attractiveness of being a politician. Limiting the amount of time that someone could be in Congress or the Senate to eight years of 12 years respectively will certainly reduce the percentage of tools seeking office and widen the potential candidate pool, but you also need to take away the long term financial gain. Keep this one simple… link the pension/benefits plan available to elected officials to the military’s compensation package. If it’s good enough for our men and women in uniform, it’s good enough for anyone serving in Washington up on Capitol Hill.

Why 'Professor' Obama Will Fail,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The health care debacle and the botched handling of the Gates arrest are showing us an important weakness in the Obama brand.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As I've mentioned before, Obama is at real risk of over-exposure.  Even though it might seem that he has to appear everywhere to sell health care reform-- the opposite may be true at this point.                
                

            
                I'm also starting to think that the president's over-exposure is just a symptom of a deeper brand problem: Obama's urge to explain everything.                
                

            
                Let's call it ""The Professor Factor.""                
                

            
                It's as though Barack Obama believes that every situation can be addressed with reasonable negotiation and explanation.  It's as if he believes that if he can just get everyone to sit down, talk (over a beer, perhaps?) or, more likely, listen to him and the wisdom he is delivering ""whether in the form of a speech or mini-lecture"" then almost every situation can be resolved.                
                

            
                Bottom line: this is simply not true, and it's a risky thing for a leader to believe.                
                

            
                Leadership is often about moving the ball forward and letting everyone catch up later. It is not about seeking approval after every play. It is about making the touchdown and winning the game -- whether or not the crowd agrees with or even understands your strategies.                
                

            
                After the Bush years, when momentous decisions were made with little articulation as to why, many Americans understandably craved a leader who could explain what he was doing and why.                
                

            
                Fact is, there is a limit to how much people want things explained. (The start time for the president's prime time press conference was changed last week because one of the broadcast networks refused to carry it. Why? Because the original start time conflicted with an interview of the ""American Idol"" runner-up.  That tells us plenty.)                
                

            
                But more than over-exposure or over-explanation, we are talking about what image is beginning to harden in people's minds about our president.                
                

            
                The polls won't answer this question for us, but at some point everyone will simply know.  Barack Obama's image is still forming.  It has not yet hardened.  But someday soon, the image will fit the man.                
                

            
                As president, you can only hope that it's an image that doesn't hobble your work.  Reagan could get away with being seen as an actor because he got things done. Clinton's moral failings could be forgiven because he got things done.                
                

            
                It's when you don't get things done or you get the wrong things done that your image hardens into something toxic.                
                

            
                My concern is that in Obama's case the image might harden into that of an idealistic, professorial type who talks about leading rather than actually leads, who has big ideas, but little practical experience.  Woodrow Wilson not FDR.                
                

            
                Think about John Kerry. As soon as he was labeled an overly-intellectual waffler, the label stuck because every time you saw him speaking, the image was re-enforced.  He sounded like an overly-intellectual waffler.                
                

            
                But in Barack Obama's case, the ""Professor Factor"" could be even more damaging if combined with the belief that despite his appeals for objectivity, reason and the facts, he is already ideologically convinced (i.e., the Gates' incident... I don't know all the facts but here's my opinion).                
                

            
                And let's not forget Jimmy Carter. He was thought to be one of the most intelligent people ever to occupy the Oval Office -- but he micro-managed his way out of office by delegating too little and being seen as too mired down in the details.                
                

            
                So far, President Obama has avoided this fate of the sticky intellectual label and the micro-manager, but unless he seriously reassesses how he is coming across to his Target Market, it could happen soon.                 
                

            
                Instead of being impressed by Obama's eloquence at the podium, people will connect his tendency to discourse with inaction and lack of results.                
                

            
                Now's the time for him to change: Step back from the public spotlight, be slower to react to the news cycle and more ready to take action without asking permission.                
                

            
                While campaigning, Senator Obama was often admired for playing it cool; President Obama has to do the same if he wants to be known as the leader with certain professorial tendencies -- rather than the professor who somehow became a president.                
                

            
                And remember, business and the business of politics is always easier when you keep marketing and branding in mind.

"You Can Run But You Cannot Hide from the ObamaCare Disaster, Mr. President","For months the Obama administration has dropped the “cone of silence” over ObamaCare. They don’t want to talk about it for a very good reason—most Americans continue to believe the health care law will hurt the nation.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                They’re right.

As the president raises hundreds of millions of dollars for his reelection campaign the last thing in the world he wants is to do is talk about terrible public policy he can’t blame on George Bush. It’s the president’s “signature issue” and it’s shaping up to be a bigger disaster than even critics foresaw.

How does he explain, after all, that his health care reform requires small businesses with 50 employees to add costly expanded coverage or pay substantial fines if they hire one more employee? The perverse effect on our small business engine of growth at the very moment when it is most needed has been that all hiring has stopped. Explain that.

What does he say to all those Americans he repeatedly scolded that they could keep their own doctors after passage of the bill? Several recent surveys of employers predict that as many as half of all employers will drop health care coverage and pay the fines because it’s less costly. What happens to all those employees? Tens of millions will be sent into government run health exchanges--without their own doctors.Good luck finding doctors to treat them in less than a few months.                 
                

            
                The law of supply and demand pretty obviously dictates that you can’t add 30 million new patients to a finite supply of doctors without destroying any chance of being treated quickly.                 
                

            
                Who wants to talk about the waiting lists in Canada or the 800,000 people waiting for needed surgeries in Great Britain? Not candidate Obama and not the Democratic Senators who are up for reelection on a legislative record of first enacting ObamaCare and then voting twice against repeal. The fact that so many doctors say they’ll quit once the law is fully implemented, it will make an inevitably bad situation even worse.

In a nation that threw off the rule of kings and aristocrats how does he explain that a panel of government bureaucrats beyond the reach of Congress or even the courts who will soon decide what treatments will be provided? Even Democrats have become skittish about this.

For that matter, illegal immigrants will likely get free ObamaCare under a recently announced program. That means that the national debt certainly will climb even higher, despite promises to the contrary. Rationing will inevitably take place and health insurance costs will continue to rise faster than ever. Please Mr. President, can you explain the point of this reform again?

No, it would be much better for all those who rammed this bad law down the throats of an unwilling public to tip-toe right past it but the American people have not forgotten.                 
                

            
                This week my campaign delivers 1.6 million petitions to the Senate demanding the repeal of ObamaCare. Last week our supporters made more than 25,000 phone calls to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats who have refused to admit the obvious truth: this law is a disaster.

The White House almost escaped scrutiny from the mainstream media last week when they conceded that the Supreme Court should take up the Constitutional questions surrounding ObamaCare as soon as possible. But how can they justify making every American buy insurance when such a sweeping power is not specifically “enumerated” in the Constitution?                 
                

            
                We’re sure the White House already relied upon the advice of then Solicitor General Elena Kagan, to spin a legal theory. They’ll doubtlessly be counting on Justice Kagan for a sympathetic ear at the Supreme Court.

Our petitioners believe that laws passed without the “consent of the governed” should be repealed by the same legislators but there are three paths to repeal: the Supreme Court, the legislature and the polling booth.                 
                

            
                We are determined to see this destructive law repealed in Congress before more damage is done, more promises are broken and before it ever arrives at the Supreme Court. Our economic recovery depends on it and, as politicians inWashington are beginning to realize, so do a lot of incumbent election hopes. Let’s talk about that, Mr. President.

              With special counsel Bob Mueller filing charges against Trump associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates this week, a divided country is quickly moving on from last week’s controversy of the “Steele Dossier.”
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The scandalou series of memos – which contained allegations of treason and impropriety by then-candidate Trump and his campaign – took on renewed life after it was confirmed that the document was little more than a political hit job paid for by both Democratic and Republican operatives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But while the headlines may shift, Mueller’s attention to a dossier-related scandal must not. Indeed, the dossier is almost certainly connected to the most audacious crime of the 2016 campaign.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              America’s senior law enforcement and intelligence officials were directly involved in the targeting of a democratically elected president for political assassination.

              Recall that the dossier first gained widespread attention and credibility after then CIA Director John Brennan, DNI Director James Clapper, and FBI Director James Comey briefed a summary of the document to a small group of D.C. leaders, including President Obama and then President-elect Trump.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              Knowledge of the classified briefing leaked in the press shortly thereafter.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In the days that followed, the New York Times raised a critical question. By spreading the dossier throughout D.C.’s political class, the nation’s spymasters virtually assured that the document’s allegations would be leaked and given undue credibility.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So why did they do it?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The official response from Brennan, Clapper, and Comey was that they simply wanted to give policymakers the “fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              After all, they added, America’s politicians “may hear about it.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Curiously, however, these spymasters also said that they gave the document no particular credence after having investigated its treasonous allegations.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To any reasonable person, this makes absolutely no sense. Why brief a document about Trump’s alleged treason, knowing it would leak to the press, when you had already investigated the accusations and found them to be without merit?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Indeed, when President Obama was briefed on the dossier and the spymasters’ justification for doing so, his incredulous response captured the confusion perfectly.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “What does this have anything to do with anything?”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              America is thus left with an important question first raised by the New York Times some 10 months ago but, conveniently enough, left unanswered.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Why would our senior intelligence and law enforcement officials bother highlighting a debunked dossier when they knew it would leak to the press, thereby giving it a degree of credibility and life it wouldn’t otherwise deserve?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              There are three possible answers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              First, one or all of these spymasters may have been influenced by their profound dislike of Trump as a person. From the “locker room” comments to fights with Hollywood personalities, even Trump supporters often find his conduct unpresidential.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A strategy of “brief and leak” would certainly be an effective revenge.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A second possibility is that these officials and their political chiefs may have been spooked by known or suspected connections between Trump’s campaign and Russian operatives. After all, they had heard months of Trump’s allegedly “soft views” on Russia and its former spy president, Vladimir Putin.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In short, Obama officials may have been fearful that a “corrupted” President Trump would shut down any collusion investigation before the facts were known.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Putting aside whether there’s any truth to these fears, it would still be wildly illegal for America’s spymasters to leak information to the media designed to damage a president. Officials working for the CIA and FBI are strictly regulated regarding their political activity, not to mention barred from disclosing classified or protected government information. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And that suggests a third and much more likely motivation of the intentional leakers: politics.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Obama administration had every reason to believe that Trump and a Republican Congress would reverse Obama’s legacy – from the nuclear deal with Iran to health care reform. Republicans were also poised to add several conservative Supreme Court justices to the court, altering the direction of the country for decades to come.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s reasonable to believe, then, that leaking a dossier alleging treason might severely wound Trump and his agenda for the duration of his presidency.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Which begs the question: which spymaster had the greatest motivation to try to bring down the president? And was he alone in his efforts?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Here’s what we know.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              On June 8, 2017, former FBI Director Comey acknowledged that he had a secret relationship with at least one newspaper with whom he shared classified or proprietary government information that advanced articles critical of the president.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Subsequent analysis showed that the former director might have been engaged in this covert media operation for far longer and in many more press placements than he has acknowledged to date.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We also know that Comey could manipulate D.C.’s culture of leaks to accomplish his personal agenda. When asked whether he anticipated the leak of a letter to Congress on a separate matter, he replied, “Of course. I know how Congress works.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In sum, Comey admitted to having the motivation, access, and ability to conduct what would effectively be a covert influence operation designed to damage the president.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But did he act alone? Reporting by the New York Times suggests not.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to the Grey Lady, there was a wholesale effort by the Obama administration to spread or disseminate classified information throughout the government and into the public domain that dealt with possible contacts between associates of Trump and the Russians.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In short, there were others – many others – who were joining Comey in a similar “brief to leak” operation designed to throw sand in the gears of a Trump presidency.   
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Regardless of who was involved or their precise motivation, one thing is certain: the spymasters’ decision to spread the dossier’s accusations contributed to nearly a year of political chaos that has roiled the nation.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Indeed, opponents of the president have repeatedly used the dossier as the foundation for their call for his impeachment. Democrats like chief investigator Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., highlight the document and its foreign author again and again to proclaim or suggest that Trump was either a secret Russian agent or had been blackmailed into doing Moscow’s bidding.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The message was clear: Trump must go.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Yet even if one agrees that Trump is not fit to serve, voters of all stripes should be outraged by the spymasters’ attempts to damage him. Indeed, one can disagree with Trump’s agenda or find him personally distasteful but that does not give license to ignore unlawful behavior by America’s law enforcement and intelligence communities.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Said differently, we cannot support an illicit political assassination simply because it brings about misfortune to those we oppose.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Accordingly, it’s time for Mueller to investigate our national security community with the same ferocity that he’s shown in his likely prosecution of Trump associates.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s time to investigate the scandal of America’s spymasters.

AMB. JOHN BOLTON: A Stark Choice Between European Model Or the American Way,"Dramatic developments in Europe in the past few weeks have graphically demonstrated the importance of America’s upcoming November 2 elections. Coming midway through President Obama’s term, there is little doubt these elections constitute a referendum on his philosophy, policies and performance.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Any U.S. citizens who doubt the significance of their impending votes need only contemplate Europe to see the consequences of further pursuing the Obama agenda.                
                

            
                Riots in the streets recently greeted French President Sarkozy’s proposal to increase the retirement age from 60 to 62. Although starting with the trade unionists, university students soon joined, in “worker-student” demonstrations reminiscent of late 1960’s Europe.                
                

            
                Just four years ago, France’s students rioted because they dreaded “précarité,” or insecurity concerning their employment prospects. They wanted guaranteed lifetime jobs, preferably in the public sector, rather than the indignity and “précarité” of pursue their own careers.                
                

            
                This past May, violent demonstrations in Greece reflected virulent opposition to cutbacks in welfare and other national subsidies, required because Greece’s profligate government spending, in violation of European Union (“E.U.”) fiscal rules, threatened the viability of the common European currency. Although fears for the Euro’s future have receded, the E.U.’s fundamental structural problems remain unresolved, so the risks of future instability remain still provoke sporadic outbursts of rioting in Athens.                
                

            
                Now, although France’s Senate approved changing the retirement age, the stability of Sarkozy’s government remains very much in question. Ironically, he came to office pledging far more sweeping, market-oriented changes in France’s economy. If he retreats on even minimal reforms like the retirement-age question, however, his entire presidency may end in failure.                
                

            
                In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron’s new government has just announced stringent budget cuts to reverse decades of massive deficit spending. These reductions are equivalent to or steeper than Margaret Thatcher’s when she took office in 1979, and will cause sweeping revisions in the excessive expectations many Britons have from their government. Nearly 500,000 public sector employees will be eliminated, and the pension-eligibility age will rise from 65 to 66. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said dramatically to the House of Commons, “Today is the day when Britain steps back from the brink, when we confront the bills of a decade of debt.”                
                

            
                British public opinion is still developing, but Cameron and his government openly campaigned for these policies in the last election. Disturbingly for Americans, his budget includes deep reductions in Britain’s defense budget, cuts so severe that many worry about London’s ability to sustain its leading role in NATO, and its long-standing place as Washington’s principal military ally.                 
                

            
                In fact, the typical reaction of U.S. defense experts has been “it could have been worse,” which is cold comfort, especially with the conflict against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan reaching a potentially dispositive point.                
                

            
                These striking developments in Europe emphasize both how hard it is to withstand the endless expansion of the state’s role in civil society, and how hard it is to roll back even failed and financially debilitating statist policies. Public expectations become entrenched, citizens become dependent and attached to their benefits, which come to be seen as “entitlements,” and the steps necessary to redress the balance can be painful.                
                

            
                With considerable justification, therefore, American voters now see the impending November 2 elections as enormously consequential for their future. The individual races effectively embody a stark choice: whether to begin the daunting task of turning the United States back toward its founding principles, or whether to descend further into the status of European social democracies like France and Greece.                
                

            
                President Obama’s nationalization of two of America’s largest automobile manufacturers, his massive European-style health-care reform, and his extravagant Federal spending increases, had little or nothing to do with recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Although justified on that basis, Obama’s agenda was in fact an ideologically-driven, highly opportunistic strategy to fundamentally change the structure and direction of American society. With substantial majorities in Congress, his objectives seemed easily within reach.                
                

            
                But unfortunately for Obama and the commentators who worship him, America never stopped being a center-right nation.                 
                

            
                The public increasingly believes that Obama’s stimulus spending has not stimulated; his increased tax, government spending and regulation burdens are substantially impeding our hopes of recovery; and his unprecedented extension of the federal government’s economic role is utterly unjustifiable.                 
                

            
                Obama’s response is visibly schizophrenic, promising more of the same if he avoids electoral disaster next week, while simultaneously implying he has “learned his lesson,” and will be less radical going forward.                
                

            
                How the United States votes on November 2 is thus an important test, but in themselves these midterm elections alone cannot be dispositive. The real test will come when Obama seeks re-election in 2012. Then too, events in Europe may well highlight the choices and widely divergent options Americans will face.

Danger Ahead for Democrats If Health Care Passes,"Washington is preparing for a House “vote” on the current health care plan, but unfortunately Congress isn't listening to the rest of America. Aside from the fact that hardworking citizens won’t appreciate the use of parliamentary gimmicks in the forms of the “Slaughter Rule” and reconciliation, Americans simply don’t like the plan.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Earlier this week the Independent Women’s Voice released a poll that showed in 35 of the most marginal districts, 69% opposed the plan and 29% supported it. The following day, another poll was released by the Anzalone-Liszt Research which was conducted across 92 blue dog districts with the end result still showing that the current plan is not favored with 42% in favor and 52% opposed.                
                

            
                As Thursday rolled around, many Democrats began to say that the momentum was swinging in their favor, but the reality continued to be that the American people are saying the exact opposite. Later that afternoon, a national Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll showed that 55% of respondents were against the current plan. It may well be that the Democrats ram the bill through Congress, but the polling consistently shows they will pay for it in the mid-term elections and beyond.                
                

            
                Furthermore, the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll shows that the number of people opposed to the plan has grown steadily while support has remained at the same low numbers. Thirty-five percent of those polled support the plan now, compared to 36% last July. The number of opposed has jumped from 47% all the way to 55%. The numbers just don’t support any claim that the American people are in favor of the proposed health care plan.                
                

            
                Worse for the Democrats, the American people recognize trickery when they see it. The dangerous combination of the “Slaughter Rule” and reconciliation to pass the bill is ruffling a lot of feathers in the world of public opinion. Fifty-three percent of those polled in the same Fox News/Opinion Dynamic research poll believe that the Democrats are “changing the rules” to get the bill passed.                
                

            
                All of the numbers add up to a terrible outcome for the incumbent party as election season heats up. The Democrats have spent the year wasting time on a bad bill that the American people recognize as a bad bill and don’t want. Yet, the rules get ignored and such a bill may get forced through Congress and into law in a simply bizarre matter. The sad part is that Americans do want real health care reform and even agree on many issues -- such as coverage for pre-existing conditions. They just don’t want the two thousand plus page bill that is poorly constructed and not paid for that is making its way through Congress and to our doorstep.                
                

            
                One final number to look at is another Fox News/Opinion Dynamic poll released Friday afternoon. The question asked in the poll was whether to keep or remove all incumbents. A staggering 68% of respondents declared they would oust all incumbents if they could. As the hours are counting down the whips are counting the votes in the House, but who is counting the votes outside the Beltway? Washington beware, those votes come in November.

Don't let ObamaCare debate derail search for lifesaving medical cures,"In one of their final votes before heading home for Congress’ annual summer recess, House Republicans voted to repeal ObamaCare – for the 40th time.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                While this bill will not go any further with the Democratic-controlled Senate than their last 39 attempts, the Republicans’ repeated efforts to vocalize their staunch opposition to the Affordable Care Act demonstrate how controversial the policy remains.                  
                

            
                The fight over Obama’s health care law will only become more heated when Congress reconvenes, as the new state insurance marketplaces – a signature piece of Obama’s law – are set to open for enrollment shortly thereafter.                  
                

            
                Some Republican Congressmen now say that unless the law is defunded, they will not pass a budget, which is needed to fund the government beyond September 30 in order to avoid a government shutdown.

                This partisan bickering is unproductive for our country and, more importantly, preventing us from addressing the real challenges facing our nation.                   
                

            
                Democrats and Republicans need to replace political fights over the budget and efforts to defund ObamaCare with the development of a pro-growth agenda that focuses on economic development, jobs, and innovation.                  
                

            
                Yet while our political leaders continue to fight about the details and implementation of a bill that was passed three years ago, radical achievements in other areas of health care are being overshadowed.                  
                

            
                A report released last week revealed there are currently 444 new medicines and treatments being tested by America’s biopharmaceutical research companies to treat and possibly even prevent a variety of debilitating neurological disorders.                
                

            
                There are over 600 neurological disorders affecting millions of Americans every year.  Some of these disorders are well known such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Multiple Sclerosis, while others are more obscure, but they are all severely crippling. In addition to physical suffering, these disorders cause both patients and their families immense pain and hardship, and cost the U.S. government billions of dollars.                  
                

            
                Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and affects roughly 5.4 million people. Without effective treatment, that number is expected to triple by 2050.  The current cost of care of Alzheimer’s patients to American society is $203 billion dollars -- a figure that is projected to increase to $1.2 trillion by 2050.                
                

            
                Recently, however, serious advances have been made in the treatment of neurological disorders. The boundaries of medical and scientific research are being pushed to new extremes, paving the way to innovative products that could potentially reverse the effects of or even prevent these devastating diseases entirely, reducing the overall cost to American society.                
                

            
                Among the 444 medicines in development are a few that represent truly revolutionary scientific approaches to medicine.                 
                

            
                For instance, several of these new medicines and treatments are using gene therapy to repair and restore damaged cells, enabling doctors to treat neurological disorders by replacing mutated genes or inactivating mutated genes that cause debilitating symptoms.                 
                

            
                A similar therapy, “Targeted RNAi Therapy,” is also in clinical testing stages.                
                

            
                In addition to providing patients and their families with hope, these groundbreaking scientific methods are helping researchers to understand more about the genes that affect the development of particular neurological disorders.                  
                

            
                A deeper understanding here could potentially lead to new ways of slowing or even reversing the effects of these diseases, which would cut costs significantly.                 
                

            
                According to the report, delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s by just 5 years could reduce the cost of care by $447 billion in 2050.                
                

            
                At a time when the implementation of health care reform remains a point of contention between the Democrats and Republicans, it is critical that we do not let these types of innovative medical achievements go unnoticed, or lose focus on the need for a continued national commitment to develop new, lifesaving medicines and treatments.                
                

            
                The persistent efforts of biopharmaceutical scientists in America have brought cutting-edge treatment options to patients, lessening the physical and emotional burdens of these disabling neurological diseases, and improving their overall quality of life.                   
                

            
                This in turn has significant impact on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our health care system.                  
                

            
                We simply cannot let ongoing battles surrounding our country’s health care system and the budget to allow us to lose sight of the importance of developing new medicines and treatments, and on medical innovation."

              Marie Claire is a women’s magazine that covers health, beauty and fashion. That used to be enough, but, like everything else these days, it has gotten political.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In fact, just being political isn’t enough. Now everyone else has to be political, too.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Thus we get the Marie Claire article by Kayleigh Roberts titled “5 Things Taylor Swift Should Have Addressed on ‘Reputation’ but Didn’t.” (For you non-Swift fans, “Reputation” is her latest album.)
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              The first thing Swift should have addressed, according to the article: “Her Decision To Remain Apolitical During The 2016 Election.”

              Roberts goes on to explain:
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “Fall of 2016 saw a slew of celebrities get vocally and visibly involved in the political process, supporting candidates and encouraging their fans to get out and vote.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              “After a period of complete silence about the election, Taylor did post on Instagram about the fact she was voting [but not who she was voting for].
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “Whether she likes it or not, Taylor’s politics (or her perceived political apathy) are a part of her reputation, and a song addressing or at least acknowledging that (even if the song did not address her personal politics) would have been impactful.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s true, last year saw a bunch of celebrities did get vocally and visibly involved in politics, but, unlike Roberts, I didn’t think that was something to celebrate.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I’m a fan of old movies, but I never say to myself “I wonder if Fred Astaire supported Roosevelt?” or “I wonder if Audrey Hepburn favored economic reform?” I don’t know the answers to these questions, because back then stars generally kept their beliefs to themselves. But, more importantly, I don’t care what they thought about those issues.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              What I care about, and what most people care about when it comes to celebrities, is how well they entertain us. Having them lecture us on how to vote is not entertaining – in fact, it tends to get in the way of entertainment.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Yet, in recent times, it seems more and more big stars feel the need to share their wisdom with us.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Celebrities, like all of us, are free to believe what they want, but that doesn’t mean they have to let everyone know about it. I’m sure there are a lot of people I pass on the street who could teach me things, but I’d just as soon they don’t buttonhole me to let me know the latest on health-care reform.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Roberts admits Swift can play it how she wants: “Taylor is not required to be open about her politics, of course, but it’s also fair to question her decision to remain silent in what was a particularly contentious and consequential battle.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I have no trouble with – in fact I favor – any celebrity who chooses to remain silent. And this argument is only stronger when the issue is particularly contentious. It makes me wonder if Marie Claire would think it’s so wonderful if Swift was more explicit about her beliefs, but on the side Kayleigh Roberts doesn’t like.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s a politician’s job to take a stance. It’s not an entertainer’s job. (An exception can be made when their politics are part of their art, but even that can be tricky.)
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So sorry, Marie Claire. Maybe Taylor Swift should end her feud with Katy Perry, and maybe her relationship with Tom Hiddleston was a publicity stunt, but as far as her keeping her politics to herself, that’s fine with me.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              One of the glories of our democracy is the secret ballot. I wish more celebrities would take advantage of it.

Obama's Worst Nightmare: Congressional Democrats,"Tue, 24 Mar 2009 14:38:53 +0000 –  By Liz PeekFinancial Columnist                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Why are Democrats undermining President Obama? It's easy to understand why Rush Limbaugh is hoping Obama will fail. From his perspective, Obama's energy, labor and health care policies (among others) will yank the country hard to the left, weakening our capitalist economy and ushering in failed socialist policies. But why is his own party running so scared?                
                

            
                From the moment Nancy Pelosi instituted crassly partisan procedural rules on the opening day of the 111thCongress, mocking Obama's promised new bipartisan era, Democrats in the House and Senate have done their utmost to discredit the president.                 
                

            
                
 From my perspective, Obama is the best thing to have happened to the Democrats in decades. He has rallied an entire generation and numerous ethnic groups to a party formerly led by a windsurfing flip-flopper.
                
                

            
                It is possible that my brain does not contain enough dark eddies to comprehend the devious calculations that have led to these maneuvers.                
                

            
                From my perspective, Obama is the best thing to have happened to the Democrats in decades. He has rallied an entire generation and numerous ethnic groups to a party formerly led by a windsurfing flip-flopper -- who couldn't unseat one of the least popular presidents ever -- an ""environmentalist"" who lives in a 20-room house that consumes twenty times the energy soaked up by a normal person and a philanderer whose best qualification for becoming president (according to a lengthy piece in The New York Times magazine) was that he had always wanted to be president.                
                

            
                By contrast, Obama is bright, attractive and ambitious. Moreover, he has lobbed up a budget just teeming with the kinds of programs that Democrats have longed for -- wealth redistribution, universal health care, and development of green energy. Though he occasionally provides an unwelcome reality check by, for instance, suggesting that teachers need to have more accountability, he generally dishes up a leftist menu that should satisfy even the pickiest vegan. Why, then, does his party seem intent on stifling the flood of goodwill that not only buoyed this president's election returns but that also carried Dems to majority rule?                
                

            
                Maybe... the president's own party does not believe in him. Maybe they think that last year's election was more of a referendum on Sarah Palin than on Barack Obama. Perhaps they doubt his mandate. Or, maybe they are just scared out of their wits that voters will blame them for the ever-rising budget deficit.                
                

            
                On both counts, Democrats are correct to be worried. Though Obama won a decisive victory, it is not clear that voters supported his policies as much as they voted for his personality. As one shot across the bow, a recent Gallup poll indicated that for the first time in 25 years Americans are more concerned with growth than with environmental issues. Oops -- ditch the windmills. Another poll indicates that more Americans oppose Obama's budget than support it.                
                

            
                Clearly the Obama administration has made some false steps -- the most recent being the proposed plan to bill veterans for their own medical care -- and has been exposed as not quite the efficiency juggernaut that was anticipated. In fact, the management of the White House staffing issues has been horrendous. The attacks on Rush Limbaugh have exposed the president as insincere -- they crushed immediately the notion that he would be reaching across the aisle and attempting to dull the nasty Beltway rhetoric.                
                

            
                Indeed, one of the most popular ambitions voiced during the campaign was bringing Americans together and softening the tone of the political debate. This is not the first administration to hold out such a promise, but I think it is fair to say that political acrimony has never been harsher than it was last week. And the collapse of civility was more absolute from Democrats than from Republicans.                
                

            
                At the end, Congressional Democrats have hurt the Obama administration. The brouhaha over AIG bonuses pandered to taxpayers' outrage but may have done serious damage to Geithner's proposed private-public plan to buy up toxic assets. Notwithstanding yesterday's market elation, investors have voiced serious concerns about ending up in Ed Liddy's shoes -- the gent who's attempting to turn around AIG as a public service while being flayed by Congress. Chris Dodd and Barney Frank are smart enough to have understood that their grandstanding carried that risk, but plowed ahead nonetheless, protecting their, ahem, rear flanks.                
                

            
                As Congress starts this week to tackle the enormous, messy and ideologically packed budget, their anxieties will only multiply. Americans are not so sure they want to allow government unfettered inroads into our commercial spaces. In a recent Rasmussen poll, more Americans tapped deficit reduction as their number one concern instead of health care reform. Given the recent GAO estimates for future deficits, taxpayers will be even more vigilant about the real costs of Obama's programs.                
                

            
                If Congress continues to waver in its support of Obama's agenda, the result may be even more internecine warfare and a watered-down list of programs. It will be a sad outcome for the party that has finally won control of the White House and Congress. At the same time, it will prove a pleasant surprise for Republicans. They can just sit back and admire the view.

"Liberal media's love affair with Hillary Clinton, 2016 race has begun","Now Playing                            Hillary on Time's cover? Enough!                                                                                                 
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                It may surprise some conservatives, but Hillary Clinton has always had a prickly relationship with the news media. That relationship reached its nadir during the 2008 campaign, when the press cleared a path for Barack Obama to win the presidency by steamrolling his competitors, including Hillary.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But with Obama out of the picture for 2016, I predict that the media won’t think twice about transferring their affections to Clinton.                 
                

            
                In fact, the media-engineered rehabilitation of Clinton has already begun. This month the Senate Intelligence Committee released its report on the September 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                The bipartisan report placed significant blame on the Obama administration, and in particular Hillary Clinton’s State Department, for ignoring growing threats in Benghazi and numerous requests for enhanced security. The report found that Islamic terrorists, not an obscure anti-Islamic video, as the administration’s claimed, were responsible for the deadly attack.                
                




    
    
    
    	
    		
    		
    		
		    	
		            More On This...
		            
		                
		                    
		                    

        
	    
	    	Bias Bash: Media ignoring Hillary's very bad week?
	    	
	        
    


		                
		                
		            
		        
        	
        
    




            
                But the report contradicts numerous press reports by liberal news outlets.                 
                

            
                A recent seven-thousand-word piece in the New York Times whitewashed Clinton’s role in the 2012 Benghazi scandal.                
                

            
                The piece dismissed strong evidence that the administration failed to respond to repeated warnings and appeals for more security at the U.S. consulate. Hillary’s press office itself couldn’t have mounted a better defense of her botched handling of the attack.                
                

            
                The media has sent other signals that it’s ready to get behind Hillary for president.                 
                

            
                Last year, CNN and NBC were in the process of producing flattering documentaries of Hillary. The networks, both of which portray themselves as straight, non-partisan news organizations, were to air the films just in time to bolster her image in a presidential run. Only a backlash forced them to shut down their projects.                
                

            
                The notion of a pro-Hillary media would surprise her supporters. Some advisers feel she has been scrutinized unfairly her entire career—from her involvement in the Whitewater scandal and her failed attempt at health care reform to her fashion sense.                 
                

            
                Many blame media bias for her squandering a thirty-point lead to a freshman senator in the 2008 primaries.                 
                

            
                In her book ""Notes from the Cracked Ceiling,"" journalist Anne Kornblut writes that feminist scholars “mostly agreed that Clinton had received harsher media treatment than Obama, sometimes in familiar ways—stories about her laugh, dubbed her ‘cackle’ by The New York Times, or about her husband.”                
                

            
                But Hillary’s problem wasn’t that she was a woman or that she was being punished for her husband’s record. It was simply that she was running against Barack Obama, who, at the time, was involved in what author and Fox News contributor Bernard Goldberg aptly described as a “slobbering love affair” with the Fourth Estate.                
                

            
                But with Obama out of the picture, the media will gush and fawn Hillary right into the Oval Office, if they can.                
                

            
                For one thing, the media are just as shrill and liberal as Hillary. We should be past the point of debate over the media’s liberalism.                 
                

            
                But here’s something sobering for any remaining doubters:  A couple of years ago UCLA politics professor Tim Groseclose conducted an empirical study of how different media outlets report political news. He found that “every mainstream national news outlet in the United States has a liberal bias,” and calculated that media bias helps Democratic candidates by as much as ten percentage points in a typical election.                
                

            
                But Hillary is more than just a liberal. She’s also married to the most popular liberal in the country. There will be no shortage of ‘90s Clinton nostalgia in America’s newsrooms in the run-up to 2016. Many in the media will root for her to win just to be able to cover Bill in the White House again.                
                

            
                To be sure, a few enterprising journalists will investigate the Clinton scandals—including, most recently, the Clintons’ dubious money-making ventures, in particular the finances of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.                
                

            
                But most of the media will fall in love with the narrative of Hillary becoming America’s first female president. It’s a milestone most journalists think is long overdue—and it’s a story few will be able to resist.

                Behind the scenes, a quiet and unassuming movement is afoot destined to reshape the future of American health care—and possibly the entire landscape of American politics.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The House currently has fourteen physicians. The Senate has two. This means less than 3% of our elected officials in Washington come from one of the most trusted professions in America—medicine. But that is about to change.                
                

            
                Rising from the ranks of my home state, three North Carolina physicians are running for Congress to address our nation’s daunting challenges. Dr. B. J. Lawson, Dr. James Taylor, and Dr. Dan Eichenbaum seek to represent the 4th, 6th, and 11th Congressional districts. Should they be elected, North Carolina would have a larger physician representation than any state in the Union—three of thirteen Congressional seats, nearly 25%. But why should America care?                
                

            
                In ""Precepts"" Hippocrates once wrote, “For if love of men is present, love of the art is also present.” In ""On Breaths"" he added, “The physician sees terrible things, touches what is loathsome, and from others’ misfortunes harvests troubles of his own.” For the Hippocratic physician, the well-being of the individual was of primary concern—not power, not money, not personal gain, and most assuredly, not the supremacy of the State. The Hippocratic physician was born to serve his fellow man.                
                

            
                But such servant leaders are in short supply in Washington today. An air of entitled aristocracy permeates our political class. Rather than guarding hard-earned taxpayer dollars with sacred trust, politicians spend with reckless abandon. Rather than leaving Washington to live under the laws they pass, most politicians cling to power for as long as possible.                
                

            
                Washington has become a city where pork and payoffs rule the day. Where backroom deals and buried earmarks are accepted as they way things get done. Where health care reform becomes about politics, power, and payoffs, not patient care. Americans chafe against this sad perversion of power. To reclaim our representative government, We the People must find new leadership.
Historically, practicing physicians have shunned politics—and for good reason. As we open the clinic door or push aside the emergency room curtain, our patient’s political leanings never cross our mind. Nor should they.                
                

            
                However, our nation now moves into complex and perilous waters. Trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security obligations must be addressed. The exploding American debt now threatens our very independence. If our democracy is to survive, these times call for thoughtful solutions and difficult decisions. Few individuals are better suited to make these difficult decisions than the Hippocratic physician.                
                

            
                To save the patient the surgeon must sometimes cut to cure. To fight some cancers the oncologist must prescribe chemotherapy. Physicians must not only understand the details of a complex system and make the correct diagnosis, they must treat the illness, even if the patient does not want to hear what the physician has to say. Physicians know that alleviating symptoms does not address the disease, that more is needed however difficult.                
                

            
                The behavior of two prominent physician/politicians, Senators Bill Frist and Tom Coburn demonstrate the credibility of the physician statesman. In sharp contrast to today’s permanent political aristocracy, Senator Frist stepped down after achieving the position of Senate Majority Leader. Why? He had promised the voters he would serve for 12 years and no more—he kept his word. Few individuals can walk away from such power. In contrast to Washington’s common but corrupt practice of earmarks, Senator Coburn has opposed wasteful spending (by both parties) so aggressively he earned the nickname Dr. No. Like Senator Frist, he too has pledged to relinquish power after 12 years of service.                
                

            
                In the fall of 2010, North Carolina may serve as a bell-weather state. North Carolina’s state motto, ""esse quam videri""—to be, not to seem to be, distinguishes the politician from the statesman. The politician is concerned with perception; the statesman is driven by character. Voters must decide if these three physicians can be statesmen. If elected, these three men must prove that they are.                
                

            
                Facing overwhelming debt, we need politicians willing to make tough decisions. In dealing with a subject as complex as health care reform, we need men and women who understand how decisions in Washington impact patient care at the bedside. Americans desperately seek elected officials committed to financial responsibility, Constitutional fidelity, and the sanctity of the patient/physician relationship. Two questions remain:                
                

            
                1) Will such servant/leaders rise to the fore?
2) Will We the People recognize who they are and send them to Washington?

No Republican alternatives to ObamaCare?

                The White House and Nancy Pelosi announced with great excitement this week that the President’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a huge success because they hit their goal of signing up 7 million people to the new federal system.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The celebrating should stop there. Hitting a target without full recognition of the brokenness of the overall health care  scheme is nothing to be proud of.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                The law has provided anything but economic security to Americans who need a buffer against life’s unexpected circumstances. For instance:                
                

            
                 
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law’s incentives will slash our economy’s total number of hours worked by the equivalent of around 2.5 million jobs by 2024, and its redefinition of the work week will force schools and small businesses to either cut employees’ hours or lay them off entirely. 
 President Obama said Americans could keep their doctors and insurance plans if they liked them, but it is estimated that more than 5.5 million U.S. residents have received cancellation letters from their insurers, including 185,000 Illinoisans. An economist from the American Enterprise Institute estimates that as many as 43 percent of Americans will face changes to their insurance plans. 
 The persistent claim that the law would “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family” has proven untrue. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office predicted in 2009 that premiums would increase 10-13 percent in the individual market and $2100 per family in the non-group market. A CMS study has predicted that 65 percent of small businesses may see their health premiums increase. And premiums have continued to rise for middle class Americans. 
                
                

            
                Our leaders in the governor’s mansion have jumped on the bandwagon, ignoring the challenge that the law poses to Illinois. While Gov. Quinn did not hesitate to push Illinoisians onto ObamaCare, enrollment has lagged. Only 13,733 Illinois residents signed up for coverage during the first five months of the enrollment period, more than 100,000 people short of the original goal. So Gov. Quinn decided to partner with the satirical news site, The Onion, to push enrollment. While The Onion is skilled at humor, losing your insurance or doctor is no laughing matter for Illinois families.                
                

            
                The administration’s solution to the law’s disastrous performance is to suspend the rule of law, and authorize a myriad of delays of some of the law’s most unpopular provisions under a “fix-of-the-day” approach to public backlash. And it’s no coincidence that some of these delays push the law’s application until after the November midterm elections.                
                

            
                While Democrats fight to delay the law’s real consequences for health consumers until after they’ve secured re-election, House Republicans have always fought for positive alternatives – not just repeals – that will provide economic security for Americans, while protecting patient choice and driving down health care costs.                
                

            
                H.R. 3121, the American Health Care Reform Act, and H.R. 2300, the Empowering Patients First Act, both repeal the president’s health care  law but spur competition to lower health care costs and provide tax incentives for people to maintain health insurance.                
                

            
                These bills and others like them embody viable alternative models to ObamaCare.                
                

            
                These ideas include allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines, enabling small businesses to pool together and get the same buying power as large corporations, and allowing individuals to pool together to provide coverage through churches, alumni associations, trade associations, and other civic groups.                
                

            
                Smart tax provisions would allow families and individuals to deduct health care costs, just like companies. Expanding, not retracting, access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), would allow individuals to deposit even more of their income tax-free into savings accounts that they can use for health expenses.                
                

            
                Reforming medical malpractice laws would protect caring doctors who just want to practice medicine.                
                

            
                Alternatives like these would also give greater flexibility to Medicare patients, tackle fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and address our doctor shortage by offering loans to medical students.                
                

            
                Thursday, the House will take up a bill I co-sponsored, H .R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, which will protect hard-working Americans from losing hours and wages as a result of the law’s redefinition of the work week.  American workers fought hard for the 40 hour work week. They shouldn’t have to give it up just because the administration needs the money that would come to the federal government by way of fines to keep the ACA afloat.                
                

            
                But we should also keep what is good about the President’s law by safeguarding individuals with pre-existing conditions through state-based high risk pools and extending HIPAA guaranteed availability protections. No one should be denied coverage based on a disease or ailment outside of their control.                
                

            
                Like any piece of legislation, these ideas aren’t perfect or complete. They need to be debated through the normal legislative process to fine-tune them to the needs of American health consumers. That’s what was missing when the Affordable Care Act was passed four years ago: a thorough debate about what works and what doesn’t.                
                

            
                While the law was passed by one side of the aisle then, that shouldn’t stop us from working together to truly reform our health care system. I hope Democrats will stop doubling down on promises that have proven impossible to keep, and join us in this fight to offer real economic security to struggling Americans.

Women Will Not Fare Well Under ObamaCare,"American women are paying close attention to the health care debate, and no wonder. After all, the majority of mothers report that they are the prime health care decision makers for their family, and women account for over half of all workers in the education and health services sector.
Unfortunately, the various ObamaCare proposals winding their way through Capitol Hill contain provisions which could prove harmful to women's health care options -- and their bank accounts.

For example, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-NV) recently unveiled package contains, among other sundry provisions, an excise tax on elective cosmetic procedures -- ""equal to 5 percent of the amount paid for such procedure,"" which is expected to raise $5 billion over a decade to help pay for Reid¹s plan.

According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS), however, women accounted for over 9.3 million cosmetic surgeries in 2008; almost 92 percent of the total. It is little wonder, then, that some are wondering if the ""Botox tax"" is sexist. As one blogger writes on the feminist site Feministe, ""women are under extreme pressure to maintain a particular physical appearance -- to look young, thin and attractive -- it seems a little unfair that women are inundated with messages that we need to constantly improve our physical appearance, and then taxed when we take steps to do just that.""

Unfortunately, the cosmetic surgery tax isn't the only proposed health reform measure that would adversely effect women's pocketbooks. The Nancy Pelosi-ushered House version of ObamaCare, for example, would impose an income tax surcharge that will ""certainly hit many small business owners -- who pay business taxes through their personal-income tax forms,"" according to Grace-Marie Turner, president of the non profit Galen Institute.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Women-owned companies now account for 28 percent of all businesses, many of which would doubtless see their earnings curtailed as a result of this and other ObamaCare taxes and mandates.

ObamaCare proposals also contain drastic cuts in Medicare, which would fall especially hard on elderly women. The House version, for example, contains almost half a trillion in cuts to future Medicare spending which could lead to reduced benefits and fewer health care options for our seniors, according to a report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, ""More than half (56%) of all Medicare beneficiaries are women; among the oldest old (ages 85 and older), 70% are women.""

Medicare cuts and new taxes are in these bills for a reason ­health care overhaul as envisioned by President Obama and Democratic leaders would be enormously expensive. Congress is under extreme pressure to find creative ways to pay for reform because of the Obama administration¹s pledge that the president will ""will not sign a plan that adds one dime"" to the deficit, and that health care reform must ""bend the health care cost growth curve down.""

Unfortunately, some worry that this drive to ""bend the cost curve down,"" may lead to reduced or rationed care, including for women. The recent recommendation of the federal Preventive Services Task Force that women under fifty get fewer mammograms did nothing to assuage those fears.

Women are rightly concerned about the rising costs of health care in America. But we should all be wary of ""cures"" that could be worse than the disease. If enacted into law, ObamaCare would effect women as mothers, workers and patients -- and not always for the better.

Obama's Fallacious Moral Reasoning on Health Care Reform,"As we predicted last week, President Obama is using moral arguments to push through congress at lightning speed his health care reform bill. In every one of his many interviews over the last week, the president has explained his insistence on immediate passage of the bill by referencing his moral imperative to provide health insurance for the cancer patient who today can't afford basic treatment. He then continues his line of moral argument with an emotional plea for Americans to pressure their representatives to seize the moment and to reject the notion of another forty years of the status quo. He ends the interviews by saying, ""This isn't about me-- I have health insurance,"" a reiteration of his case that his bill is an apolitical issue of right and wrong.
President Obama is right and smart to talk about ethics in the same breath as health care reform. Notwithstanding the many merits of American health care, merits routinely overlooked and imperiled by our rush to reform, our insurance system is cumbersome and impractical. And increasingly, it is unjust. The government has an obligation to rectify this injustice by protecting citizens from some unscrupulous health insurance companies that gauge their clients and routinely escape payment. As President Obama says, the state also has a moral obligation to use tax dollars to provide basic health care for citizens who are unable to purchase it on their own.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But if there is one thing ethicists and moral theologians agree upon, it is that conditions and circumstances surrounding an ethical issue do matter, and that these indeed can change the moral value of the issue in question. For example, giving money to a poor man may usually be a good thing; but giving it to him when you know he is going to buy a gun and kill his family would be all together evil.
                
                

            
                President Obama doesn't seem to be aware of any conditions or circumstances that may alter our ""moral imperative"" to pass his bill and to pass it right now.                
                

            
                
We should be aware of many.                
                

            
                
1) President Obama's argument that our choice is between a) his bill right now and b) no reform for another forty years is fallacious.

2) His refusal to answer basic questions about how we are going to pay for his bill (refusing to take off the table the massive surtax option while also refusing to say he plans on using it if he can) is not fair.

3) Independent budgetary analysts disagree with the President about what this reform bill will do to minimize overall government health expenditures (the president says we ""can't afford"" not to pass his bill) and about the impact of the 1 trillion dollar cost on other parts of our economy.

4) Under the proposed legislation individuals will be required to have health care coverage that meets minimum benefits standards. These standards will be established by the Obama administration. There is very good reason to believe these minimum benefits that health insurance companies must provide will include abortion on demand. Obama has said reproductive care is essential care, basic care"" and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has added, reproductive health includes access to abortion. Congressman Joe Pitts (PA) recently warned in a written statement that any individual who does not have a plan that meets the minimum benefit standards will be forced to pay a 2.5 percent tax penalty. And any employer who does not provide coverage that meets these standards will pay up to an 8 percent tax penalty,""

5) This week the president himself admitted he cannot guarantee tax money will not be used for abortions under his plan. Why can't he guarantee that? Because he wants it in his plan and will mandate it if he can.

6) Euthanasia is not explicitly excluded from the category of basic health care either. If it is not excluded, eventually it will be demanded, and we will pay for it.
For President Obama to continue to use moral arguments to demand immediate passage of his bill, without also putting to rest the conditions and circumstances I outline above, is ethically reprehensible and politically unacceptable.

Power to the People In the Health Care Debate,"The right of the American people to voice their opinion is a Constitutional right and the cornerstone of democracy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As we confront health care reform, never has the need for the American people to be heard been more important.                
                

            
                On Thursday, President Obama will host a select group of Congressional members, from both sides of the aisle, to share and discuss health care reform in our nation. This event can either usher in a new age of transparency and true tri-partisanship or show that petty grudges and backroom deals control our government, with detrimental consequences.                
                

            
                There is however a key component missing. Americans want to share their ideas directly. While the average citizen may not have a seat at the table on Thursday, in America, power ultimately rests with the people. And the American people have the ability to change everything provided their voices are heard.                
                

            
                For this very reason, the Center for Health Transformation is hosting the “American People’s Online Health Summit.” This an ongoing conversation, on our blog, is leading up to the White House summit on Thursday, Feb. 25. Every day there is a unique topic with a panel of experts commenting and responding to America’s needs; your needs. What questions do you want answered. What do you believe needs to be discussed at the White House summit?                
                

            
                Featuring notable health care leaders, including former FDA Commissioner and former National Cancer Institute Dr. Andy von Eschenbach; former U.S. Senator Tom Daschle; former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, M.D.; the blog provides possible solutions for transforming our health care system. More importantly, the blog is about people; Americans who want health care to be affordable, accessible and appropriate to them.                
                

            
                At the Center for Health Transformation, we have moved the needle forward bringing solutions to some of our greatest challenges in providing the best health care in the world. Transparency, elimination of fraud, tort reform, FDA modernization, health information technology, quality of care and personalized medicine are some of the areas where we are leaders for decision makers and truly, for all Americans.                
                

            
                CHT is based on the following premise: Small changes or reactionary fixes to separate pieces of the current system have not and will not work. We need a system-wide transformation. Unlike other alliances, CHT unites stakeholders across the spectrum (providers, employers, vendors, trade associations, disease groups, think tanks) and government leaders at both the state and federal level to drive transformation according to a shared vision and key principles. At the core of CHT is the individual; the American.                
                

            
                Americans are at center stage with a chance to share their thoughts and be heard. We encourage everyone to participate, every day, in the “American People’s Online Health Summit” and tune in on Thursday for the televised White House summit and CHT’s live blogging event.

And they represent the most significant sector of our economy.

                For many years, I have served in both the public and private sector. As former head of the Small Business Administration, I learned about the challenges and desires of aspiring entrepreneurs and established employers regarding the tools necessary to start or grow an existing enterprise. But the biggest concern for these small business owners was health care and their options.                
                

            
                They were worried about escalating premiums, limited choices and inflation of costs due to frivolous lawsuits. In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that of the 45 million uninsured Americans, 22.3 million are self-employed or work for small businesses without benefits.                
                

            
                Initially, Obamacare was sold as a new and less expensive option for insurance provided through health exchanges. But the reality is that from small startup companies to large corporations, employers have more rules that keep changing and confusing requirements to keep track of. For most, costs are increasing and options are decreasing.                
                

            
                The Affordable Care Act is supposed to provide more plan options and rein in health care costs with competitive prices. Yet, small businesses are now being forced to comply with burdensome regulations and pay more taxes and fees. Companies employing 50 or more workers, who work more than 30 hours per week, are forced to provide them with mandated health insurance. And to make matters worse, the tax credit they were promised for up to 50 percent of their health care premium costs is only available if you have 10 or fewer full-time workers with a salary of less than $25,000 a year.                
                

            
                In essence, Obamacare is increasing small business costs, contributing to more of a part-time employee workforce and is causing hiring freezes in the sector of the economy that contributes to this nations overall financial prosperity.                
                

            
                Today, small business isn’t buying the promise of the Affordable Care Act.                 
                

            
                A recent Public Opinion Strategies survey of more than 400 business owners with 40 to 500 employees states that 64 percent of small business franchise owners believe the law will have a “negative impact” on their business. And more that one in four businesses (28 percent) say that in 2015, when the employer mandate is scheduled to take full effect, it is ""likely"" they will drop their insurance coverage and pay the penalty per employee.                
                

            
                This widespread anxiety is causing small businesses to be stymied because of over-regulation and economic uncertainty. And unfortunately, like bad fuel in an engine, if the rollout for the employer mandate is anywhere as grim as the individual mandate rollout, small businesses will continue feeling angst, uncertainty and the stagnation they have been experiencing for years.                
                

            
                This is not what American entrepreneurs hoped for, or expected.                
                

            
                We are looking for a real solution that will control spiraling health care costs and effective options, which have long been a worry and a source of anxiety for small business. We are asking for more health plan options and a real cost curve reduction in premiums that continue to spike up.                
                

            
                In short, we need and demand options, not mandates or a government takeover for millions of small businesses in the U.S. Small businesses deserve for their voices to be heard. Small business not only will lead our nation out of this economic morass; they will be pivotal in the expansion and growth of our economy for generations to come.                
                

            
                Is anyone listening?

Special election's lesson: Where Trump once won big there's now a centrist path to victory for Democrats,"close
						
	                    
	                        
	                   
	                   
	                            
		                            PA-18 election a warning for both Republicans and Democrats?
		                                Associated Press reporter Tom Lobianco on the lessons that can be drawn from the Pennsylvania special election between Rick Saccone and Conor Lamb.
	                        	
					 
				  
              
            
		 

    





								
								



 



       
       
      
          
              Democrat Conor Lamb held a lead of a few hundred votes Wednesday with the final absentee and provisional ballots still being counted in Tuesday’s special election for a Pennsylvania congressional seat, leaving the race too close to call. His strong showing – and likely victory – has important lessons for Democrats for the November elections, when all 435 House seats will be on the ballot.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Republican officials are alleging voting irregularities and plan to seek a court order impounding voting machines in four counties in the district pending a recount.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A victory by Lamb over Republican Rick Saccone in the 18th congressional district near Pittsburgh would be a major upset in a district that voted for Donald Trump by a margin of nearly 20 points in the 2016 presidential race. In the past two congressional elections, Democrats didn’t even field a candidate in the solidly Republican district.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Lamb’s ability to draw so many votes demonstrates that there is a viable, centrist path to victory for Democrats, even in places where President Trump won by double-digit margins.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Notably, Lamb was outspent by Saccone and his allies by a ratio of approximately 5-to-1. Surely, Republicans cannot spend in this way nationwide to retain competitive seats, underscoring their vulnerability.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For these reasons, Lamb’s performance has major negative implications for continued Republican control of the House and vindicates the critical importance of Democrats taking a centrist approach to the most competitive races.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              If the Democrats want to win back the red and swing districts lost to President Trump in 2016, they must follow Lamb’s example and take moderate positions on key issues that are in line with their constituents.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Lamb promised to work with leaders of both parties to take immediate action on the opioid epidemic. He also put forward a plan to work with Republican leaders to stop stalling on infrastructure investment and move forward on multiple projects, as well as job training initiatives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Lamb even supported President Trump’s imposition of heavy tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, two industries that are critical to western Pennsylvania’s economy.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In addition, Lamb took important strides to distance himself from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., openly stating that if elected he would not support her bid to retain her leadership position come November.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Like Lamb, Democratic candidates must take positions that swing voters, especially those who have traditionally voted for Democrats and only recently defected to the Republican Party, can support.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These are voters who applauded the recent tax cuts – the same cuts that Nancy Pelosi infamously called “crumbs.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These voters – especially those who voted for President Obama in 2008 or 2012 and then President Trump in 2016 – support working-class families, particularly members of local unions, and worry about their future financial security.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Indeed, Democrats must not only campaign as centrists but also govern as centrists. This is the key to not only welcoming voters back into the party, but also retaining them in 2020
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To be sure, Lamb’s big vote totals and likely victory in Pennsylvania are a wake-up call for Democrats and Republicans alike.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Saccone’s failure to win an easy victory indicates that the White House and the Republican Party more generally may not be fully prepared for what is at stake in November.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump and Republican leaders will receive credit for the legislative accomplishment of tax cuts and for taking steps toward de-escalation of tensions with North Korea. This may benefit GOP candidates for the House and Senate.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But these accomplishments may just as easily get lost in the large set of problems facing the Republican Party, including seemingly unending turnover at the White House and in the president’s cabinet, along with inaction on the increasingly important issues of health care reform and gun violence prevention.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Ultimately, if Democrats are to retake the House in November, they must turn to the moderate center once again.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Democrats have a major opportunity to build on Lamb’s strong performance in Pennsylvania and potentially flip seats nationwide. Above all, this will require a strategy that attracts, rather than divides, voters and presents an effective alternative to the current Republican Congress.

Time for a New Game Plan?,"President Barack Obama, faced with falling approval ratings and increasingly impatient with Senate negotiations over health care, is weighing a shift in strategy that would offer more details of his goals for overhauling the nation's health care system.                
                

            
                The president is considering a speech in the next week or so in which he would be ""more prescriptive"" about what he feels Congress must include in a bill, top adviser David Axelrod said Tuesday in an interview.

                This is not a scientific poll."
Why This Doctor Dropped Out of Medicaid,"Back in 2005, with my office overflowing with patients, I made the decision to drop out of Medicaid. I wasn't alone. At the time a national survey revealed that a full half of America's practicing physicians weren't accepting Medicaid. It was a necessary business decision. Medicaid was only paying me $30 for a new patient, $8 for a follow-up. Many of my elderly patients had Medicaid for a secondary insurance, and this 20% of the bill amounted to less than $2. At a time when my offices expenses were skyrocketing, it simply wasn't worth the time to ask my office biller to fill out and submit the Medicaid bills.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Nevertheless, it was a very difficult decision for me emotionally, as I was very connected to my patients. Rather than ask them to see another doctor, I decided to keep seeing them for free, or at a markedly reduced rate. My patient Marcus, a mentally challenged 40-year-old man with severe constipation, who worked part-time as a janitor, always came with his mother; I kept seeing him and she insisted on paying me $50 per visit. At the same time, I had several disabled patients who I was glad to see for their Medicare payments alone, and many elderly patients who would pay a small fraction of the 20% that Medicare didn't cover.                
                

            
                Overall I was much happier, as were my patients, and I had no urge to turn back the clock when Medicaid raised its rates slightly. Still, a significant problem remained. As more and more doctors dropped out of Medicaid, I found fewer specialists I could refer patients like Marcus to see.                 
                

            
                When his constipation worsened and he needed a gastroenterologist, I ended up referring him to Bellevue Hospital, where I had trained, and where he received good care from the G.I. residents in the clinic.

But Medicaid payments to hospitals have been cut drastically by the states, threatening the networks of residents and attending who take care of these patients. States have cut Medicaid payments both to universities (Graduate Medical Education that pays for residents), and to public hospitals themselves by many millions of dollars. In New York City, for example, last year Health and Hospital Corporation (which includes Bellevue) was cut by $105 million. This year the state is on the verge of cutting $370 million from the city's public hospitals (including $70 million in Medicaid reimbursements).                
                

            
                At the same time, if the current plan for government-run health care reform passes, we are facing an unprecedented expansion of Medicaid by 10-15 million more people. But who is going to take care of them if the networks we already have established are overwhelmed as it is and facing further cuts?                
                

            
                As it is, Medicaid is an insurance that is too easily overused. PriceWaterhouseCoopers, an accounting research firm, has determined that Medicaid patients are twice as likely to use the Emergency Room unnecessarily than the uninsured. This overuse generates expense, and Medicaid, like Medicare, is driving the country into bankruptcy.                
                

            
                But rather than address this problem, we are on the verge of adding many millions of more patients to this costly dysfunctional system.

                 Will Health Care Battle Help or Hurt GOP?Help. Republicans are exposing how wrong both pieces of legislation are and I'll more than likely support a GOP candidate next fall
Hurt. Republicans are just playing politics with an issue that's of critical importance to all Americans.

"Newt Gingrich: An important, first step towards a next generation health care system","Now Playing                            Will conservatives find compromise on GOP health care plan?                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The ObamaCare repeal bill Republicans presented this week is an important, first step toward achieving a next generation health care system in America.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                For Republicans to meet their commitment to repeal ObamaCare – and to do so in a way that is real, lasting, and substantive – the writers of the American Health Care Act had to closely follow the Senate’s narrow budget reconciliation rules, which strictly limit legislation passed under budget reconciliation.                
                

            
                The Congressional Budget Act – which is the overarching legislation that sets reconciliation rules for both houses of Congress – says reconciliation can only be used on legislation that alters federal spending, revenues or the national debt.                 
                

            
                ObamaCare certainly fits that bill, but rules in the Senate further limit reconciliation bills through a rule named after the late Democratic West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd.                
                

            
                Under the Byrd Rule, at any point during the reconciliation process, any senator can block any bill provision that doesn’t change the budget, spending or debt in specifically measurable ways. Other limitations under the Byrd rule include prohibitions against provisions that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the committees that recommend them, or provisions that in any way change Social Security programs such as disability.                
                

            
                If House lawmakers include provisions that the Senate Parliamentarian finds to be extraneous or unrelated to budgetary matters, Senate Democrats can block them and slow down the Republicans’ momentum. This is the bottleneck through which every provision of the American Health Care Act has to fit.                
                

            
                That’s why the American Healthcare Act is just the first of many steps to come.                
                

            
                Still, even with these limitations, this legislation is better for consumers than our current law.                 
                

            
                This bill will allow Congress and President Trump to eliminate ObamaCare taxes and its mandate that forces people to buy health insurance; strengthen and expand Health Care Savings Accounts to give families more control over their health care spending; reform Medicaid so states can use per-capita block grants to best serve their residents; provide tax credits to people who don’t get insurance through other avenues; and take health care decision-making power away from Washington and return it to patients and doctors.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price will implement dramatic regulatory reforms in the health care sector that will empower states to make health care decisions that are best for their residents while lowering costs.                
                

            
                These regulatory changes must be followed by a series of targeted health care reform bills, which should be much more visionary, more powerful, and have a positive impact on the entire health care system.                
                

            
                The health care system is enormously complex. It addresses many completely unique challenges – each with its own special set of intricacies – and health care accounts for one-fifth of our nation’s economy.                 
                

            
                More importantly, our health care system’s success means life or death for millions of Americans.                 
                

            
                So, a rolling series of focused bills is far better for the American people than one gigantic bill that no one reads or understands.                 
                

            
                Passing future targeted bills will be more difficult if we let President Trump lose this first major fight – we cannot allow that to happen.                
                

            
                The 21st Century Cures Act is an excellent model to follow. The Cures bill was targeted, specific and just under 1,000 pages long. By comparison, ObamaCare drastically changed many aspects of our health care system, was 2,700 pages long and produced more than 20,000 pages of related regulations, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.                
                

            
                The American Health Care Act is the start of a remarkable reinvention of American health care. By 2018, President Trump and the Congress will have made serious progress and we’ll have a dramatically better system for all Americans.

              The Trump administration stands on the verge of a big win, or a significant defeat on this Friday, July 21. It’s the Republican Party that decides which way it’s going to go.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              You know the story. We are 6 months into this presidency and so far, the republican Congress has delivered very little. Now, it’s crunch-time: next week the senate will vote on ObamaCare, and after that, its tax reform.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Just for a moment think about what it would mean for the economy and for Middle America, if the president gets a win on both! You get to choose what health insurance you want, and you get to keep more of the money you make! Isn't that what republican voters, voted for?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I try to steer clear of stock market predictions: we leave that to our guests, but i have to tell you, that almost everyone who has appeared on “Varney & co.” says that your investments will do even better if the republicans deliver and so will the economy. The Republican Party holds the key.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And if they don't come through, watch out! Again, I don't make predictions, but the people who are paid to forecast are unanimous: no health care reform, no tax cuts. Watch out below.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              That’s the economic side of the argument: politically, there's just as much at stake. Our perception of the Trump presidency will change dramatically, if he gets a win: if he doesn't, the media will become even more contemptuous than it is now. They'll call him a failure. A lame duck after only a year.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This presidency is now in the hands of the Republican Party.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And the future of the Republican Party is in the hands of the Republican Party.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s Friday, July 21 and we're on the brink, America.

              Democrats are desperate to derail long-overdue tax relief that is heading to the Senate floor for a vote this week – even if by doing so they take money from the pockets of their own constituents.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              There are no good arguments against allowing hardworking Americans to keep more of their money. But that hasn’t stopped Democrats, who are intent on denying President Trump a victory at any cost – including lying about the Senate tax bill’s impact in an attempt to block its passage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This deceit was on full display at a CNN Town Hall debate this week, where career politicians Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Maria Cantwell of Washington state leaned on shopworn Democratic talking points as the basis for the their opposition to the tax bill. These include the following five myths that have been making the rounds among Democrats and their media allies. 
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 1: The tax bill is a tax increase on the middle class.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Cantwell: “Raising taxes on the middle class is wrong, and that’s what this bill does.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Recognizing the popularity of a middle-class tax cut, Democrats are trying to use the Bizarro-world argument that the tax cut bill is actually a tax increase. They cite a Tax Policy Center report claiming the bill would raise taxes on 87 million middle-class families.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              What the Democrats don’t mention is that the Tax Policy Center is a project of the left-wing Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, funded by donors like George Soros who want to disrupt President Trump’s agenda by any means necessary.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Tax Policy Center can only arrive at this eyebrow-raising conclusion by making the unrealistic assumption that the tax cuts would expire after 10 years.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In reality, the tax bill would provide significant relief for the middle class by doing the following: doubling the income threshold under which families pay no taxes at all to $24,000; doubling the child tax credit to $2,000; and eliminating the 15 percent tax rate in favor of an expanded 12 percent rate, among other provisions.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The above changes would save ordinary families thousands of dollars a year. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 2: The majority of the tax bill’s benefits go to the top 1 percent of earners.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Sanders: “60 percent of the tax benefits in the Republican plan would go to the top 1 percent.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats are trying to distract from the bill’s middle-class tax relief by claiming most of the benefits go to the super-rich. But in reality, the bill is targeted at the middle class.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In addition to the middle-class provisions mentioned above, consider the bill’s relief for Main Street small businesses. The bill offers a 20 percent small business tax deduction for all small businesses earning less than $500,000 a year. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This 20 percent tax deduction would allow small business owners to keep more of their earnings, helping them to compete with their big business and international competitors – as well as hire more employees, raise wages and expand.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to the Tax Foundation, 97 percent of small businesses earn less than this $500,000 threshold, meaning the overwhelming majority of small businesses would see relief from this provision.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But who would see little-to-no relief from it? The top 1 percent, with annual incomes of roughly $500,000 and higher.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Given this clear middle-class relief, how do Democrats back up their 1 percent claim? By pointing to the tax bill’s provision to bring the corporate tax rate in line with international standards.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              However, survey and economic evidence demonstrates that corporate tax cuts benefit the middle class in the form of higher wages, better workplace benefits, new job opportunities and lower consumer prices.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Even higher dividend payouts benefit the middle class, because the majority of corporate stock is owned by retirement plans, including IRAs, 401ks and government pension plans that help ordinary Americans save.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 3: The tax bill will grow deficit by $1.4 trillion.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Sanders: “This legislation will grow the deficit by $1.4 trillion. Mark my words.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats are suddenly pretending to care about the nation’s fiscal state by pointing to the tax bill’s $1.4 trillion of lost revenues on a static basis over 10 years. What isn’t said is that this is only a 3 percent drop from the $43 trillion Congressional Budget Office (CBO) revenue projection over this timeframe.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But in the real world – outside of simplistic Excel spreadsheets – people respond to incentives. With more money in their pockets and in their communities, consumers, businesses and investors will spend more, creating economic growth that will more than pay for the $1.4 trillion in lost revenues.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to the CBO, every 0.1 percent increase in the gross domestic product adds over $250 billion in revenue over 10 years. This means that even returning to 2.5 percent economic growth – still well below the U.S. historical average – would more than pay for the tax cut.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 4: The tax bill won’t create economic growth.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Cantwell: “No, I don’t think (the tax bill) will grow (the economy).”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Given the dynamic effects on tax revenue from even minor economic growth, Democrats are at pains to deny the growth created by tax cuts. They cite left-wing economists to make their case – but historical evidence and commonsense undermine it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
               The tax cuts enacted under Presidents Coolidge, Kennedy and Reagan, among others, all generated several years of supercharged economic growth. The principle is simple: More money in the wealth-creating hands of the private economy – and less in the wealth-destroying hands of government – creates economic growth.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Some 100 economists wrote an open letter to Congress with the following message: “Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 5: The tax bill will cause 13 million people to lose health insurance.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Sanders: “This bill… will result in 13 million people losing their health insurance.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Given this scare tactic worked so well to kill health-care reform, Democrats are trotting it out in an attempt to do the same to tax reform. But the facts are very different this time around.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Far from kicking people off health insurance as Democrats imply, the tax bill would simply eliminate the health-care tax on those who choose not to purchase health insurance. This tax is borne mostly by working- and middle-class Americans: Nearly 80 percent earn $50,000 a year or less. In fact, this provision would reduce the middle-class tax burden even further.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The tax-cut bill currently before the Senate offers ordinary Americans the best opportunity for tax relief in a generation. But Democrats are putting their narrow political interests ahead of what’s good for the country and lying to try to sink it. Their agenda should be exposed.

The Dow Is Soaring... Tell It To the Jobless,"Update: In classic left-wing fashion, the Obama administration is holding a jobs summit in December in “an attempt to signal his concern about the growing ranks of the unemployed,” according to The Washington Post. The summit seems to entail a bunch of people who have jobs bemoaning the fact that others do not. Government in action or is it inaction? The Post didn’t say whether the summit would be capped by everyone holding hands and singing “Kumbaya,” but it’s good odds.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Forget the stock market. Sure, the Dow has made a stunning improvement since January 20. The market has jumped from just under 8,000 to over 10,000 -- a 29 percent increase.

But that’s not the place to put your money. Unemployment is outpacing Wall Street just a bit. Joblessness went from 7.6 percent when Obama took office to 10.2 -- whopping a 34 percent  increase. If you could invest in job loss, you’d be a big winner under the current president.

Clearly the people without jobs might not appreciate that philosophy. Who could blame them? For all that the media maligned the Bush administration over the economy, unemployment was better the entire time we had George W. Bush as our president.

A lot better. Nearly half the time Bush was in office, unemployment was less than half what it is now. And only in the last two months of his tenure did it top 7 percent. Unfortunately for job seekers, Bush is jobless and Obama is the one looking out for their interests.

Only he isn’t. Obama has been on a relentless campaign to get health care reform passed. He pushed the stimulus bill. He’s bailed out Wall Street and Detroit with mountains of cash so high we couldn’t count them in our lifetimes. That money went to the politically connected. Bet you already know who they gave their money to this last election cycle. Hint: It wasn’t Republicans.

The result is a job crisis the likes of which we haven’t seen since the early ’80s. And what’s scary is the trend lines for the Dow and unemployment are almost identical. CNBC Chicago Board of Trade reporter Rick Santelli made the connection in a Nov. 6 appearance. As Santelli talked, a terrifying chart showed how, as the Dow hit 8,000, 9,000 and 10,000, unemployment hit 8, 9 and 10 percent. At this writing, the Dow is at 10,246.97 and unemployment is at 10.2 percent. That’s as close to a 1-to-1 correlation as you get.                
                

            
                Santelli told the “Fast Money,” audience the future looks bleak. “I shudder to think where the unemployment rate is going to be at 11 and 12,000 in the Dow.”                
                

            
                Despite Santelli’s alarm, most of the media have depicted the rise in stocks as if the economy is experiencing good news. There is a lot more to an economy than the Dow, but it didn’t look like the networks grasped that fact. The Dow “soared,” “climbed,” “shot up,” “gained” and pretty much every other synonym you could muster. When the Dow crossed 10,000 again, CBS anchor Katie Couric could only find the good news. “Tonight, Dow 10,000. The blue chip index hits that milestone for the first time in a year as investors give the economic recovery a vote of confidence.”

Back on Oct. 14, it was CBS “Evening News” correspondent Whit Johnson raving about the Dow. “The Dow gained more than one hundred forty-four points Wednesday to close at ten thousand fifteen. Since hitting bottom in March the Dow was up nearly fifty-three percent.” That especially upbeat comparison left out the 1,400 points the market had dropped from inauguration to March 6.

Before Obama started dumping taxpayer money into every big business under the sun, he also helped drive the market down. Still, 29 percent is a strong number and if it weren’t offset by far worse unemployment, Obama would have a right to crow – all day long if he wanted.

He doesn’t. Ordinary Americans know that it’s the joblessness number that is more important. It’s not just “the economy, stupid,” it’s *jobs,* you idiots. Americans have gotten used to amazingly good jobs numbers under Clinton and Bush. Now that has all come crashing down and Obama can’t keep blaming Bush forever.

Back in 2003, CNN Money told its readers that “6 percent unemployment was -- in the early 1990s -- considered by many economists to be ‘full employment.’” That “labor-market nirvana” meant that pretty much everybody who wanted a job had one. The article went on to say that the Congressional Budget Office believed “5.2 percent unemployment is the new standard for full employment.”                
                

            
                For more than two years, from December 2006 to February 2008, U.S. unemployment was even better than that -- less than 5 percent. Twenty-seven straight months with joblessness averaging less than 4.7 percent. And much of that time, TV viewers were told the economy was doing poorly.                
                

            
                Bush suffered for that spin for eight years. Now it’s Obama’s turn. Journalists convinced the American public that good economic growth and low unemployment were bad economic times. Only one of those numbers has rebounded and the jobless know Obama hasn’t delivered. And no amount of news spin can make 10 percent unemployment look good.
Now, unemployment threatens to go higher still and jeopardize Democrats’ mid-term election prospects. The question is what craziness will Obama and desperate Dems try to pass to buy off the voters in 2010?                
                

            
                And how will Americans afford it?

Immigration Reform Shouldn’t Include Taxpayer-Funded Health Care,"BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND - MARCH 16:  A nurse tends to recovering patients on a general ward at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital on March 16, 2010 in Birmingham, England.  As the UK gears up for one of the most hotly contested general elections in recent history it is expected that that the economy, immigration, industry, the NHS and education are likely to form the basis of many of the debates.

                Living as an undocumented immigrant in the United States can be very difficult. Struggling as a sick, injured, or chronically ill immigrant can mean days, weeks, or even months of discomfort, with a visit to the emergency room usually the most affordable remedy.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                By act of living here illegally, these immigrants have very limited options for health care. All human beings deserve at least a basic level of medical care —to prevent loss of life, deliver a baby, etc.— but does that mean that taxpayers should foot the bill for more extensive care for anyone who manages to cross our borders and establish illegal residence in the US without detection?                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            We should focus more on sending a strong message to potential immigrants that legal access to government-funded health care should not be an expectation upon arrival in the United States.

                In March 2013, the California Endowment, a private foundation that advocates for affordable healthcare, launched a TV ad in which several undocumented immigrants explain to the viewer:                
                

            
                “I’m undocumented…We work hard and we’re strong, but everyone gets sick sometimes. Yet many of us don’t have health care. We cannot get health insurance. Now our country has spoken, saying that everyone should have affordable health care. Does that mean ‘everyone’ everyone? I dream that ‘everyone’ includes all of us.”                
                

            
                It’s unfortunate that part of that ad is untrue. While undocumented immigrants have traditionally had few choices for obtaining health care in the U.S., they can get it legally by purchasing private health insurance, paying out-of-pocket to visit an urgent care or community clinic for routine care or non-life threatening illnesses, or visiting an emergency room.                
                

            
                Urgent care and community clinics have been a primary health care option for undocumented immigrants and many uninsured U.S. citizens for quite some time. While visits aren’t exactly cheap, they’re preferred for low-income families who are generally healthy and can set some money aside for illnesses that require prescription medications, casts for minor bone fractures, etc.                 
                

            
                Controversy already exists over the use of emergency rooms for medical care by undocumented immigrants because they know they’ll receive care regardless of their ability to pay for it —which they commonly don’t. Funding for those visits currently comes from federal, state and local taxes, and hospitals in certain cities with high immigrant populations have an expectation for the flow of these patients.                
                

            
                But now that the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) is set to go into effect in 2014, the public cry from immigrant advocacy groups is growing to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for health care coverage under the Act. Section 1312 (f)(3) of the law: “Access limited to lawful residents. If an individual is not…a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States, the individual shall not be treated as a qualified individual and may not be covered under a qualified health plan...”                 
                

            
                Under President Obama’s current health care reform plan, undocumented immigrants will have to wait eight years before becoming eligible for public health care benefits, and ten years under a Congressional plan.                
                

            
                We’re in a time when the need for immigration reform has never been more real and our country and government never more ready. However, we’re also in the time of sequestration cuts, shrinking budgets, smaller incomes and higher taxes. Have we created the expectation among undocumented immigrants that by virtue of simply living in the U.S. they should have access to the same government benefits as legal residents, despite the fact that many of them don’t pay the taxes that fund those programs?                
                

            
                Obamacare isn’t free, and undocumented immigrants meeting a certain income threshold would have to pay premiums for any part of the plan they’re eligible for. However, currently the law provides federal subsidies for low-income families applying for public health insurance. According to a 2012 study by the Washington-based Urban Institute, undocumented immigrants —many of whom would require a federal subsidy— will make up the nation’s second-largest population of uninsured, or about 25 percent. All those subsidies would come from U.S. taxpayer pockets.                
                

            
                This isn’t about being anti-immigrant; it’s about following the rules, and not being rewarded for breaking them. My family emigrated from Cuba to the U.S. 50 years ago with nothing but the clothes on their backs, and no expectations or demands of the U.S. government. They worked very hard, followed the rules, and eventually became U.S. citizens. It’s hard for them and other immigrant families like them to watch millions of people who knowingly broke the rules demand equal footing just because they didn’t get caught coming here.                
                

            
                There’s no question that the current health care situation in the U.S. isn’t ideal for undocumented immigrants, but it’s not supposed to be. It’s already difficult enough to make routine health care accessible and manageable for U.S. citizens and legal residents, who must take priority over those living here illegally.                 
                

            
                Instead of relying on immigration reform to find a way to pay for undocumented immigrants’ health care with tax dollars, we should focus more on sending a strong message to potential immigrants that legal access to government-funded health care should not be an expectation upon arrival in the United States.

              Do people who are overweight or obese deserve health care? In the United Kingdom's socialized health care system, the answer appears to be ""no."" And if Democrats get their way, the same could be true in the United States.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To save money, the U.K. National Health Service recently announced it will ban obese patients from many surgeries for up to a year. Such rationing is standard in single-payer health care systems. Americans will face the same fate if Democrats can enact Medicare for All here. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently introduced his Medicare for All bill backed by 15 other Democratic senators. His call to create such a single-payer health care system was a major part of his failed campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.

              In addition, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is urging Democrats to make single-payer a centerpiece of their upcoming campaigns.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The rule applies to patients with a body mass index of 30 or higher. It would hit a 5-foot-10 man who weighs more than 209 pounds, or a 5-foot-4 woman who weighs more than 174 pounds. These patients will have to wait a year, or lose 10 percent of their weight, before they can receive elective surgeries like hip or knee replacements.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              The National Health Service in Britain believes such discriminatory rationing is the ""best way of achieving maximum value from the limited resources available.""
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Of course, overweight people aren't the only ones denied care in single-payer systems. The bureaucrats who run them have little choice but to ration care for everyone.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              When patients pay virtually nothing for health care, they have little incentive to limit their consumption. If someone feels even slightly under the weather, he or she can immediately go to the doctor and demand medicine, rather than simply rest up and hydrate. So patients flood doctor's offices and hospitals.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              With no market forces at work to regulate demand, the only way for the government to keep costs under control is to forcibly limit the supply of medical services.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Single-payer systems do so by offering doctors and hospitals relatively paltry sums for their services. The average general practitioner in the United Kingdom earns about $130,000 per year. By contrast, a general practitioner in America earns over $200,000 annually, on average.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This combination of lower pay and seemingly limitless demand for care is causing many British doctors to leave the medical field – or go elsewhere to practice. There are 7,000 fewer doctors in the United Kingdom today than in 2005. In just the first month of this year, nearly 300 doctors applied for certificates to work overseas.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In addition, fewer medical students are completing their educations. In 2016, half of junior doctors left the National Health Service after their first two years of training. That is an abrupt increase from 2011, when less than three in ten junior doctors exited.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As a result, the National Health Service is in the midst of an unprecedented staffing shortage. More than 30,600 positions are currently vacant. Almost 40 percent of those openings are for nurses and midwives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So patients wait. More than 4 million are standing by for surgery – the highest figure in a decade.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The single-payer system in Canada is hardly better, particularly for patients seeking specialist care. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time between referral from a general practitioner and treatment by a specialist in 2016 was 20 weeks – the longest on record.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              America's own experiment with single-payer – the Veterans Health Administration in the Department of Veterans Affairs – is a national embarrassment. A federal investigation found that more than 200 veterans died while waiting for care at a Phoenix VA facility in 2015. The same is true of almost 100 veterans at a Los Angeles VA hospital between October 2014 and August 2015.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These horror stories are worth remembering now that the apparent failure of the GOP's health care reform effort has revived calls for single-payer in the United States.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Some U.S. doctors appear to be falling in line behind liberal icons Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. According to a new survey from Merritt Hawkins, a physician recruiting firm, 42 percent of doctors strongly support single-payer. Fourteen percent are somewhat supportive.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Supporters of single-payer health care should realize the error of their ways, because single-payer isn't a shortcut to universal health care. As the experiences of other countries prove, it's a pathway to grotesque rationing, long waiting lines and needless suffering.

Will Obama Finally Do the Right Thing With Our Money?,"Reuters
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The first year of the Obama administration is over and the president’s State of the Union address is scheduled for Wednesday, January 27. Now is a good time to ask, how has President Obama done -- from a fiscal perspective -- during his first year in office?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It's fair to say that, unlike President Bush (43), President Obama was dealt a very bad fiscal hand when he entered office. Shortly before his swearing in the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the fiscal 2009 budget deficit would be $1.2 trillion -- up from $459 billion in 2008, $161 billion in 2007, and a $237 billion surplus in fiscal 2000 when Bush entered office. From a financial statement perspective, the national debt almost doubled and the nation's total liabilities and unfunded social insurance obligations almost tripled during the eight years that President Bush (43) was in office. And unlike his two predecessors, President Bush (43) expanded entitlement programs (i.e., Medicare prescription drug benefit) and did not support enactment of statutory budget controls during his tenure. The controls that were first put in place in 1990 expired in 2002 and Washington has been out of control ever since.                
                

            
                The country was also in a recession and trying to avoid an economic free fall when President Obama took the oath of office. This represented a stark contrast to the state of the economy when President Bush (43) was sworn in.                
                

            
                The newly inaugurated President Obama took immediate steps to address the recession and rising unemployment levels. He worked with the Congress to push through a $787 billion recovery and reinvestment act. Unfortunately, he let the Congress take the lead in designing the bill and the result was that only about one-third of the bill's cost represented a true ""stimulus."" By that I mean, initiatives designed to stimulate both the economy and job growth that were timely, targeted and temporary. The rest of the bill represented a long list of wants that were included in the ""emergency"" bill and weren't paid for. In addition, as was the case with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the bill did not include clearly defined objectives and the administration did not establish clearly defined criteria and conditions upfront in order to ensure that the funds would generate appropriate value for money. As a result, while the price tag was large, the impact of the bill has been disappointing.                
                

            
                Again following the Congress's lead, shortly after entering office President Obama signed a fiscal 2009 appropriations bill that provided for a 8.3 percent increase in discretionary spending, including an over 10 percent increase in funding for the Congress. All this at a time when core inflation was low and going down! In fairness, this bill was initially developed by the Congress during the Bush (43) administration. However, only President Obama had a veto pen when it arrived on his desk. He signed it but promised more fiscal discipline in the future.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, President Obama's 2010 budget submission package did not demonstrate much fiscal discipline. Based on projections by the President Obama's own Office of Management and Budget (OMB), it showed annual deficits in the trillions for several years and huge projected increases in public debt during his presidency. While President George Bush (43) was arguably the most fiscally irresponsible president in the history of the Republic, this first Obama budget submission caused many to worry that President Obama's fiscal record might be even worse.
After these early actions, public concern with escalating federal spending, growing deficits and debt began to increase and President Obama decided to hold a Fiscal Responsibility Summit at the White House in February 2009. I was one of about 100 participants who attended. I participated in the general sessions and the Social Security ""breakout session."" President Obama even called on me by name to solicit my views along with a few others. I stated that he needed to support a special commission or task force to address our large, known and growing structural deficits and begin to put our federal financial house in order.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, the summit turned out to more show than substance. As a result, nothing much came of it despite the fact that there was a pretty clear consensus that a credible Social Security reform effort could receive bipartisan support. The administration and the Democratic leadership in Congress had evidently already decided to push ""health care reform"" as their top domestic priority.                
                

            
                There were a number of troubling and unprecedented actions taken during the first year of the administration with serious potential implications over time. For example, the federal government acquired a majority stake in two major auto companies: General Motors Corporation (now effectively Government Motors Corporation) and Chrysler Corporation. This action was clearly inappropriate and it set a very troubling precedent. After all, these major auto companies could have restructured under existing bankruptcy laws and the government could have provided some assistance without taking them over.                
                

            
                Another very troubling action was the federal government's decision to guarantee about $5 trillion dollars in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt in the face of significant pressure from our nation's two largest foreign creditors (i.e., Japan and China). This puts taxpayers on the hook for any losses that will result over time. It also demonstrates the leverage that our foreign lenders can exert on us.                
                

            
                More recently, contrary to President Obama's promise of more fiscal discipline, the Congress passed, and the president signed, a fiscal 2010 appropriations bill that included an over 12 percent increase in the base level discretionary spending even though core inflation has been virtually nonexistent during the past year. As a result, during the past year, President Obama has signed two annual appropriations bills that increased the base level of discretionary spending by over 20 percent! And this does not include the spending associated with the special ""stimulus"" bill and various ""bailout"" efforts.                
                

            
                And now the administration says it will ""get tough"" in its fiscal 2011 budget proposal. It will be interesting to see how tough they will get. After an over 20 percent increase in the base level of discretionary spending, ""tough"" should mean cutting and eliminating programs with a resulting reduction in the base level of discretionary spending. I seriously doubt that will be the case.

Looking back, the president's domestic policy agenda during his first year was focused heavily on attempts to achieve health care reform. However, to the concern of many Americans, the related legislation involved a further expansion of the federal government's role as well as hundreds of billions in federal spending and taxation over a ten year period. -- This despite the fact that the federal government already had over $38 trillion in unfunded promises relating to Medicare alone!                
                

            
                The above actions, combined with the disappointing results from the stimulus program and rising unemployment has resulted in increased public concern, dissatisfaction, and some anger, in connection with the president's domestic agenda. This concern is evidenced in a number of public opinion surveys and in the results of the special Massachusetts Senate election this past week.                
                

            
                As the president prepares to address the nation before a joint session of Congress this week, his prospects for achieving comprehensive health care reform have declined dramatically. At the same time, the public's concern regarding escalating deficits and debt and our increased reliance on foreign lenders has risen even further. As a result, President Obama is feeling pressure to take steps to demonstrate his concern for ""fiscal responsibility"" in actions rather than words.                
                

            
                Not only that but this past week the administration and the Democratic leadership agreed to pursue a statutory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rule and a Fiscal Future Commission. While pursuing a statutory PAYGO rule is clearly appropriate, the one being discussed is filled with loopholes and exceptions. In addition, the related budget proposal does not include discretionary spending caps or reconsideration triggers for mandatory spending programs and tax preferences. These and other budget controls need to be pursued. This includes the need to establish a specific debt/GDP goal along with enforcement mechanisms to help ensure that the goal will be achieved.                
                

            
                The administration is also clearly correct that it will require a special process in order to be able to make the tough choices associated with additional budget controls, reform of current social insurance programs, health care cost reduction, reprioritization of other spending, and tax reform that will generate additional revenues. All of these efforts must be undertaken and acted on if we expect to put our nation on a more prudent and sustainable fiscal path.                
                

            
                In order to make the required ""tough choices"" a special bipartisan Fiscal Future Commission or Task Force should be created. To be successful, this commission or task force must be very different from the typical ones in at least two key ways. First, it must engage representative groups of the American people beyond Washington's Beltway with the facts, the truth, the tough choices, the prudence of acting sooner versus later and the potential adverse consequences to our country and our families if we don't. Second, it must be guaranteed a vote on any of its recommendations that receive a predetermined super-majority support from the commission/task force members.                
                

            
                It is clearly preferable for such a special body to be established by law rather than by Executive Order. Having it be established by statute will help to ensure bipartisan buy-in to the process and the members who are appointed. In addition, the only way to ensure that the commission's recommendations will be considered and voted on is if the Congress is required by law to do so. Importantly, in the final analysis the Congress must vote on any related recommendations and the President must decide to sign or veto any related bill in order for the commission of task force's recommendations to become law. Therefore, the process is clearly Constitutional despite assertions by some to the contrary.                
                

            
                The Congress should move expeditiously to create such a bipartisan or nonpartisan commission despite opposition from a range of far right and far left groups. These groups want to protect their narrow interests and, based on statistically valid public opinion surveys, are clearly outside the mainstream of American public opinion. They are essentially arguing for a ""do nothing"" and ""status quo"" approach to addressing our nation's serious fiscal and financial challenges. However, the numbers are clear and compelling and our foreign lenders are already expressing concerns and taking action to reduce their risk associated with our federal government not being able to put it's financial house in order. If the Congress is unwilling or unable to act, the President should create such a special commission by Executive Order. Doing nothing is simply not a real option.                
                

            
                Our fiscal time bomb is ticking and time is not working in our favor. Therefore, in 2010 President Obama must continue to focus on what can be done to help ensure a sustainable economic recovery and to address our high level of unemployment. At the same time, he must also put a process in place in early 2010 that will facilitate making the tough choices needed to put our federal finances in order and avoid a ""super sub-prime crisis"" that would result if our foreign lenders lose confidence in our willingness and ability to act. Any recommendations that are adopted by the Congress and signed by the president should be implemented once the economy recovers and we make meaningful progress on unemployment. President Obama should also discontinue any efforts designed to create new entitlement programs or promises when the federal government has already made tens of trillions in unfunded promises already.

The time for talk is over. The time for action is now.

                While Republicans running for president immerse themselves in primary and caucus battles (and plan for a possible contested convention), it’s worth considering well in advance how they should do battle with the eventual Democratic nominee.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Politics resembles business, sports, betting and board games in that winning requires not just making the right moves in real time but also anticipating the right moves for the times ahead.                 
                

            
                In politics, victory requires you to define your adversary’s vulnerabilities long before their negative definitions of you solidify into concrete that traps you, as Barack Obama’s demonization of Mitt Romney trapped Romney in 2012, months before Romney’s nomination.                 
                

            
                Republicans must intensify their case against Hillary Clinton now, before both parties’ national conventions in July. They can’t be outmaneuvered by Clinton’s pouring of concrete on them!                
                

            
                The vulnerabilities of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and determined underdog Bernie Sanders are apparent from public opinion polls. But Clinton is the higher priority focus.                
                

            
                In a fairly recent Gallup poll, voters described Clinton, as a “liar” (voters say she is “dishonest,” they “don’t trust her” and she has “poor character”). Voters identify Sanders as a “socialist.”                
                

            
                But let’s get real. The liar will defeat the socialist (Clinton triumphs by telling lies and selling lies). Even if the FBI uncovers strong evidence that Clinton committed criminal offenses with her personal email system, how likely is it that Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department—controlled by Obama—will pursue those criminal charges?                
                

            
                So, let’s go with the conventional wisdom that Clinton’s nearly insurmountable delegate lead will make her the Democratic nominee (despite recent impressive primary wins by Sanders). And let’s examine where Republicans should call out Clinton for the harm she would do to the “everyday Americans” she claims to “champion.”                 
                

            
                The evidence is in Clinton’s own misleading statements. According to the website On the Issues, described as “non-partisan and non-profit,” here are some citations, drawn from “newspapers, speeches, press releases, book excerpts, House and Senate voting records, Congressional bill sponsorships, political affiliations and ratings, and campaign websites from the Internet.”                
                

            
                Here are just some examples:                
                

            
                • Clinton has insisted that, “I am a progressive who gets things done.” Really? When asked by ABC’s Diane Sawyer what her “marquee achievement” was, Clinton “changed the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a women’s forum in Manhattan last year. ‘I see my role as secretary [of state]—in fact leadership in general in a democracy—as a relay race. You run the best race you can run, you hand off the baton. Some of what hasn’t been finished may go on to be finished,’ she told [New York Times columnist] Thomas Friedman.”                 
                

            
                Huh? Clinton’s clumsy attempts to distract from her lack of accomplishments provide Republican presidential candidates with target-rich opportunities to set the record straight.                
                

            
                As The Washington Post has reported, even many Clinton supporters have struggled to come up with any significant Clinton achievements.                 
                

            
                Clinton herself provides little help as she twists herself in knots attempting to defend her defense of ObamaCare. She’s reduced to taking credit as the progenitor of the president’s unpopular health care reform.                 
                

            
                She told Iowans in a campaign rally in January, “It was called HillaryCare before it was called ObamaCare.” But as The Hill (online) points out, “Clinton has had to tread carefully on ObamaCare throughout her campaign: Democrats support the law but are increasingly willing to acknowledge that it doesn't address the rising out-of-pocket costs.” And Republicans looking for a detailed prescription for how to repeal and replace ObamaCare are advised to consult a new book by my friend (and Fox News contributor) Steve Forbes, “Reviving America: How Repealing Obamacare, Replacing the Tax Code, and Reforming the Fed will Restore Hope and Prosperity.”                
                

            
                • Clinton has said, “What's true in our daily lives is also true at the highest levels of government. Keeping America safe, strong, and prosperous presents an endless set of choices.” But the damaging choices Clinton has made include her support of President Obama’s increasingly dangerous, disingenuous and deceptive Iran nuclear deal. Her other catastrophic choices as secretary of state range from her lies and failures of judgment about Benghazi and Libya at large to her massive mismanagement of U.S. policies regarding Syria, Russia, ISIS and other slaughterers of innocents, documented in The Huffington Post.                
                

            
                • Clinton called criticism of her by Republicans as “all a political ploy.” Well, it’s not a ploy for Republican presidential candidates to brand Clinton with her own words. As author and Donald Trump supporter Wayne Allyn Root suggested, “Do you remember [Clinton’s] Congressional hearings over the Benghazi disaster? Hillary famously said, ‘What difference does it make?’ when referring to four dead American heroes. Make her own that brand. ‘What difference does it make’ should become Hillary’s middle name. Make her run on Benghazi, Obamacare and Obama’s economy, and Hillary will soon find out what difference it all makes.”                
                

            
                The Republican plan to defeat Hillary Clinton is as simple as ABC: Always Brand Clinton—by quoting her own dishonesty and disinformation.

Time to drive a stake through heart of ObamaCare,"While the debacle known as ObamaCare has been superseded for the moment by the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and the fireworks in the GOP presidential race, the political battle to repeal this law will continue. Pushed through against popular will by using obscure parliamentary tricks and dispensing old-fashioned “favors” with key lawmakers, ObamaCare has been an unmitigated disaster rife with price hikes, website crashes, lost coverage and corruption.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The American public’s reaction to ObamaCare has been loud and clear, as it has led to two cycles of Republican sweeps at the congressional level. That’s because few things are as personal and cherished to Americans as health care.                
                

            
                President Obama’s notorious untruth “if you like your plan you can keep it” became painfully evident to millions of Americans when they got cancellation letters from their insurance companies. Changing plans, increased bureaucracy and regulation also meant that many Americans could no longer keep the doctor they like, despite President Obama’s repeated assurances that they could.                
                

            
                Eye-popping premium hikes for millions of Americans are another shocking result of the so-called “affordable” care act. The on-coming “ObamaCare sticker shock” will be hitting customers with an average of 18 percent higher premiums. Insurers in many states are seeking increases of 20 percent to 30 percent and, in one case, even 60 percent. The evidence continues to mount that this law is hitting millions of Americans hard in their pocket books, at the same time it has turned their health care coverage upside-down.                
                

            
                No wonder that over the past six years, when President Obama first hatched this scheme, literally hundreds of polls have never shown a majority of public support for ObamaCare.                
                

            
                The state exchanges ObamaCare created have revealed another ugly aspect of the law – an opportunity for corruption. Oregon’s state exchange – Cover Oregon – should be the poster child.                
                

            
                Then-Gov. John Kitzhaber proclaimed that the exchange was to be the model of progressive health care dreams. Kitzhaber, a doctor by training, was ObamaCare’s staunchest defender. But Kitzhaber has resigned in disgrace and now faces potential indictment for allowing his fianceé to use state resources for her consulting clients. As the Washington Times, The Oregonian and local newspapers like the Willamette Week have reported, he allowed the exchanges to be run by his campaign operatives rather than by IT or other professionals.                
                

            
                The Wilmette Week reported in April, “Kitzhaber handed oversight of the Cover Oregon mess to a secretive campaign consultant who liked to call herself the Princess of Darkness. By her own admission, Patricia McCaig knew virtually nothing about health care reform or the reasons Cover Oregon had crashed. Her primary mission was not to save a beleaguered state program, but to get Kitzhaber re-elected. Emails that Kitzhaber’s office tried to delete from state computers show McCaig was effectively in charge of all decision-making for Cover Oregon beginning in February 2014.”                
                

            
                State officials who refused to toe the line were bullied by the campaign hacks. When she refused to go along with the company line, one official -- Carolyn Lawson -- was told, “You will be resigning today. It’s going to be for personal reasons. You can write the resignation letter or we can write it for you,” according to news reports. Lawson is now suing the state.                
                

            
                Most egregious is that after spending more than $300 million in taxpayer dollars received from the federal government, Kitzhaber’s campaign operatives decided to simply abandon the state exchange and join the federal exchange. The move came after Kitzhaber was told that it was close to operational, but polls showed it was a liability.                
                

            
                According to the Washington Times, “Evidence from official documents gathered by congressional investigators or obtained under open records laws suggests Mr. Kitzhaber’s aides applied pressure to kill the project even though the governor had been told the exchange could be fixed and made operational.”                
                

            
                The malfeasance by elected officials and political operatives involved in one of these state exchanges underscores the disastrousness of ObamaCare. With spiraling costs, lost coverage and corrupt exchanges, it’s time to find a way to drive a stake through the heart of this disastrous program.

"Republicans Beware, It's a Trap","Break out the bipartisanship. President Obama is ready for another summit. This time he’s invited Republicans to the table later this month to discuss potential compromises on health care reform amid widespread complaints that efforts so far by him, and his Democratic allies in Congress, have been too one sided and secretive.

But Republicans must proceed with caution. This is a trap.

Obama needs to publicly appear more pragmatic and less partisan. And, after Scott Brown’s upset win in Massachusetts last month, he also needs some Republicans to help him get his proposal passed. By letting the bill totally fail, he doesn’t get that glossy narrative in the history books that he so desperately wants. If he can persuade a few moderates in the GOP to reconsider their opposition by co-opting a Republican idea or two, Obamacare becomes law and he can tout bipartisanship. Then, when the massive tax increases hit and problems ensue, he can shift the blame to his enemies. If it sounds shady, it is.

The setting of another televised meeting also benefits Obama more than it helps Republicans. It’s called calculated political window-dressing, and Team Obama has a black belt in the sport.

The President knows he’s the better orator and will make Republicans look like a bunch of stone-walling, puerile jerks in the process – much like he did two weeks ago when he visited House Republicans at their Baltimore retreat. There, he lambasted them for saying no to his policies and chastised them for not cooperating – all in front of the TV cameras, even though Republicans had already put forth ideas and were ignored all along.

So why not call a do-over? A majority of Americans want Congress to hit the reset button. According to a Fox News/ Opinion Dynamics poll conducted February 2-3, 2010, 47% of respondents say that the next step in health care reform should be starting over, something Democrats are unwilling to do.

It would be one thing if Republicans actually wanted to reform health care above all other issues. It would be another if the American people actually *wanted* health care reform, but they don’t -- and they certainly aren’t buying the alarmist language being peddled by the left. In fact, they never have.

The health care ""crisis"" is largely trumped up to justify greater government. A genuine problem exists for about 12 million people who cannot get health insurance for their families. You don't need to take over one sixth of the economy to do that. In their political calculus as they work they way to the “30 million uninsured” figure they so frequently tout, Democrats factor in illegal immigrants, healthy 20-year-olds, and the financially blessed who simply refuse to buy insurance and say that there is some gigantic calamity.

The challenge is that if you want to solve the issue of the uninsured, or even the problem of pre-existing conditions, all roads lead to big government solutions (as Mitt Romney discovered in Massachusetts). If you want to cover the uninsured, you must require everyone to buy insurance and fine people who don't sign up; you simply have to subsidize those who cannot afford it. Tackling the issue of pre-existing conditions results in the same outcome. To cover those sick people, the government must force the healthy people to sign up and pay -- hence, big government. One thing leads to another and you inevitably end up back at square one: Obamacare.

The GOP must not be fooled. Obama will not suddenly and seriously consider tort reform or allowing the purchase of insurance across state lines when he hasn’t budged on them so far. Both run against his core beliefs. Moreover, if you let Obama define the problem, then the solutions will be ones that Democrats favor, ones that have already been rejected. That is just a fact.

Republicans cannot afford to appear as the Democrats do: distracted. The primary concern of the electorate is jobs. By following the president, aka the Pied Piper of policy, the GOP will be led off the same cliff from which the left is currently dangling.

The GOP doesn’t have to work with Obama on bad policy simply because he asks for it. Bipartisanship means working together on issues both parties want -- issues Americans want. Republicans should want no part of this effort, unless they can totally start from scratch. That should be their price of admission.

                President Obama blames sexism for Hillary Clinton’s tight presidential race. But that’s not the “ism” that’s holding her back. Donald Trump has opened an eight-point advantage over Clinton on which candidate is honest and trustworthy, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. “Truthism” — defined as the voters’ preference for candidates who tell the truth and obey the law — is interfering with Hillary’s plan to become the first woman president.

                Obama suggests it’s time. No argument there. But Hillary’s not the one to make history. Voters need to remember her history. She’s gotten where she is by riding her husband’s coattails … and by lying. Electing Hillary Clinton would validate the wrong ways to get ahead. It would endanger our nation’s precious heritage: the rule of law.                
                

            
                Hillary resembles Eva Peron more than a pioneering feminist like Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady Stanton.                
                

            
                On the campaign trail, as Hillary vows to “crack every last glass ceiling” and win equality for women, she often invokes her supposed struggles to become the first female partner at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas. What’s the real story? She got that law job in — surprise — 1977, just after hubby Bill Clinton was sworn in as the state’s attorney general. She was catapulted to partner two years later, when Bill was sworn in as governor.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Electing Hillary Clinton would validate the wrong ways to get ahead. It would endanger our nation’s precious heritage: the rule of law.
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                Fast forward to 1993. Newly inaugurated President Bill Clinton announced a Task Force on National Health Care Reform and made Hillary the chair. This was his wife’s big moment, but she insisted on keeping secret the names of her advisers, barred the public and press from her task force meetings and presented an entire revamp of the nation’s health care system to Congress without even getting the lawmakers’ input. Her arrogance set back the cause of health reform for many years.                
                

            
                Then, in 2000, Hillary spotted another chance to capitalize on her husband’s position. She moved to New York, where she had never lived or worked, and ran for the U.S. Senate, rolling over any locals who might have sought the nomination. Chuck Schumer took pains to deny the obvious on election night, declaring “she won this election not because she was first lady, but because she worked hard.” Right.                
                

            
                After an unremarkable stint as New York’s senator and a failed presidential bid in 2008, Hillary took the consolation prize of secretary of state in 2009. Four years later, she left the State Department in shambles, according to numerous Inspector General reports, with diplomatic posts unsecured, $6 billion unaccounted for and the department’s official records missing.                
                

            
                Hillary is in hot water with the FBI because, as secretary of state, she conducted all her business on a private email system, shunning the government system that is subject to oversight and Freedom of Information Act requests. She even sent and received classified information on that private, easily hacked system, which put the nation’s security at risk. And after leaving office, she dodged requests for her records. Instead, she destroyed thousands of emails and smashed as many as 13 computers and handheld devices.                
                

            
                The details of the FBI’s ongoing investigation of her private email system are complex, but everybody who’s ever worked knows that when you leave a job, you don’t destroy the records and smash your computer. Honest people don’t have to do that.                
                

            
                Why did she? Some have speculated that she was hiding a pay-to-play scheme where the Clintons raked in multimillion-dollar gifts to their foundation and megabucks speaking fees for Bill Clinton in return for access to the secretary of state. News leaked this week that the FBI is conducting an extensive investigation into the Clinton Foundation.                
                

            
                Hillary is also under investigation for perjury and obstruction of justice by the House of Representatives. She’s even in legal hot water in her new hometown, Chappaqua, N.Y., for renovating her house without getting the required permits from town hall. Just one more example of why she’s surrounded by scandal. She thinks laws are for the little people. She doesn’t have to obey them.                
                

            
                Clinton’s disdain for the law and her sense of entitlement are finally catching up with her. Women who make it on their own know that these attitudes can torpedo a career. President Obama is trying to tell voters that sexism is to blame for their reluctance to vote for Hillary. Don’t believe it.

ObamaCare boosters are wrong about the American Health Care Act - just like they were about ObamaCare,"Do any of these lines sound familiar?
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your insurance plan, you can keep it. The Affordable Care Act will cut your yearly premiums by $2,500. The law will “bend the health care cost curve downward” and save taxpayer money. 
                
                


                
            
                Oh, and the website will be as easy to use as Amazon.  
                
                


                
            
                These are the arguments ObamaCare supporters, including in the liberal media, deployed to pass their federal health care takeover. They should sound familiar and completely unrelated to the experience of most Americans.
                
                


                
            
                Many in my home state of Tennessee lost the insurance plans they liked. Premium prices have almost doubled, and doctors are harder to find. Barack Obama promised his namesake law would boost the economy, but across the country, small and large businesses report ObamaCare harms their ability to hire and grow. 
                
                


                
            
                Under ObamaCare, for the first time in decades, average life expectancy in the U.S. declined, and the mortality rate rose.
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            While not perfect, the new AHCA reflects conservative values of constitutionalism, limited government and the free market, containing an option for states to waive ObamaCare regulations that are driving up the cost of insurance.
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Yet defenders of the indefensible, a law which cost Democrats the House of Representatives, Senate and White House, are making all sorts of dishonest claims about the American Health Care Act, a better alternative that will return stability and choice to the individual insurance market.
                
                


                
            
                Not only that, insurance would mean actual health care. High-deductible ObamaCare plans are barely worth the paper they’re printed on – much like reports that ObamaCare was just fine until Donald Trump came along. In reality, Tennesseans and others voted for the president in large numbers because local health insurance exchanges are near collapse. 
                
                


                
            
                Remember when ObamaCare creator Jonathan Gruber admitted Democrats relied on “the stupidity of the American voter” to foist their disaster on the public? Republicans, on the other hand, trust in Americans’ ability to see past the disinformation and make their own health care decisions with their own money, the idea at the heart of the AHCA. 
                
                


                
            
                Because our plan repeals billions of dollars of taxes on everything from prescription drugs to insurance itself, those voters will have more to invest in health care (or whatever they like). The AHCA expands health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, and tax credits to help low-income earners and middle-class families purchase insurance. 
                
                


                
            
                Importantly, it modernizes Medicaid to ensure only those who truly need the program take advantage. If you can believe it, ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion favors able-bodied adults over the poor and disabled who rely on the program. That’s unfair. 
                
                


                
            
                Charges that the AHCA discriminates against patients with pre-existing condition are untrue. In fact, the law contains funding to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses. Claims that the law punishes rape victims are cynical acts of desperation and proven false.     
                
                


                
            
                ObamaCare’s individual and business mandates are gone, another feature the Freedom Caucus and I liked about the original AHCA. Others we didn’t like as much, and my conservative colleagues and I worked hard to give states and consumers greater flexibility in the version that passed the House.  
                
                


                
            
                While not perfect, the new AHCA reflects conservative values of constitutionalism, limited government and the free market, containing an option for states to waive ObamaCare regulations that are driving up the cost of insurance.
                
                


                
            
                The AHCA is only the start. While the Senate considers the House bill, the President and his Secretary of Health and Human Services are making every effort to exempt individuals, families and businesses from ObamaCare regulations. HHS Secretary Tom Price, a conservative doctor like me, knows exactly what the Trump administration must do to help more people afford insurance.    
                
                


                
            
                Like me, he knows insurance is meaningless without access to good doctors and medicine. In Congress, the Freedom Caucus, GOP Doctors Caucus and other concerned members are working to expand generic drugs, reduce the costs of starting a medical practice, and to encourage life-saving medical innovation. 
                
                


                
            
                But opponents of real health care reform will say anything to protect ObamaCare at the expense of the people it hurts. To me, Americans’ well-being is more important than any party’s political legacy. And it's more important than insurance companies’ bottom lines. 
                
                


                
            
                Right now, numerous government bureaucracies are funneling taxpayer money to a few big insurers, whose profits are soaring along with the national debt. The object is to bring transparency to a process that’s become too convoluted and cumbersome to comprehend, much less afford. The price of an office visit or medical procedure shouldn’t be such a mystery.
                
                


                
            
                The truth is that Republicans are working hard to undo the damage ObamaCare has done and improve health care in America for all of us. We’re putting patients first.

The Democrats' Biggest Mistake,"The mainstream media’s bias towards the Tea Party movement has been undeniable since its emergence in February 2009.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It has been systematically ignored, belittled, marginalized, and ostracized by political, academic, and media elites who have portrayed the movement as being driven by racism, bigotry, and white supremacy.                
                

            
                Indeed, Kate Zernike’s coverage of last Saturday’s “Restoring Honor” rally on the National Mall for the New York Times, is no exception from that of the media and political elites who continue to denigrate, minimize, and marginalize the importance of what has become the most potent and powerful movement in America.                
                

            
                Zernike’s piece contains an array of the unfounded and unsubstantiated claims such as: “even if Tea Party members are right that any racist signs are those of mischief-makers, even if Glenn Beck had chosen any other Saturday to hold his rally, it would be hard to quiet the argument about the Tea Party and race,” notwithstanding all evidence to the contrary.                
                

            
                Instead of focusing on the explicitly apolitical nature of the rally or the lengthy tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, she discussed the alleged beliefs of unnamed Tea Party “critics” who “say they hear an echo of slavery, Jim Crow and George Wallace.”

Who are these “critics”? When and where did they say this?                
                

            
                And given the overarching non-political agenda and of the event, it remains fundamentally unclear why Zernike chose to reference “Rand Paul, the Republican nominee for Senate in Kentucky, said that he disagreed on principle with the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that required business owners to serve blacks.”                
                

            
                Indeed, Zernike coverage is littered with allegations of racism that are not only unsubstantiated, they make no sense.                
                

            
                At one point, she went so far as to suggest that the anti-systemic, anti-Washington, pro-Constitution, fiscally conservative values of the Tea Party movement are actually a manifestation of deep-seated racism because “the government programs that many Tea Party supporters call unconstitutional are the ones that have helped many black people emerge from poverty and discrimination.”                
                

            
                Not only are the various activists, members, and supporters of the Tea Party movement are united behind a simple set of principles – advocating limited government, limitations on the recently passed health care reform bill, and deficit reduction, and a return to Constitutional principles – so too is a broad-based, ideologically, political, racially, and economically diverse majority of the electorate.                
                

            
                What Zernike wrote just isn’t true. Why indeed is the Tea Party movement indistinguishable from the issue of race? Is it because it is predominantly comprised of white people? Eighty percent of America is white. Why does this make it racist?                
                

            
                Put simply, and to be crystal clear, the Tea Party movement is not about politics or class or race. It is, above all, about upholding fundamental American values.                
                

            
                Indeed, the ordinary citizens, a large percentage of whom have never been in politics before, that congregated on the Mall this past Saturday represent a broad-based national movement whose scope and breadth and depth of support has been unappreciated and fundamentally not understood.                
                

            
                While traveling this past weekend, I was stopped by a couple in the Dallas airport who very kindly said that they enjoyed watching my commentary on ""Hannity.""                
                

            
                They were an interracial military couple -- one is serving in the National Guard, the other is in active duty.
Both are supporters of Glenn Beck and the Tea Party movement – and had attended Glenn Beck’s “Restoring Honor” rally on the National Mall.                
                

            
                They wanted to set the record straight that “any effort to brand the Tea Parties as racist or hostile is just absurd. We aren’t racists or bigots. We revere Dr. King and respect everything he did in to achieve his dream for our country. And we certainly are not puppets of some right wing political agenda. We are ordinary Americans who love our country but believe that we need to return government back to the American people. Washington is broken, and both parties are equally to blame.”                
                

            
                The bottom-line conclusion is clear. Despite efforts by many in the media and political class to demonize the Tea Party movement, the real issue driving the movement is not partisan rage on the right, nor alleged racism, but a profound crisis of governmental legitimacy.                
                

            
                Having spent the past 18 months chronicling the rise and the influence of the Tea Party movement along with pollster Scott Rasmussen for our book ""Mad As Hell,"" I have seen firsthand the extent to which the Tea Party movement has already fundamentally altered American politics and will almost certainly affect both the 2010 congressional elections and the 2012 presidential election.                
                

            
                Indeed, the Democrats' biggest mistake has been to underestimate the importance of a movement that is of unprecedented and potentially of fundamental importance to the American political system.                
                

            
                Attacking dissent may feel good in Washington, but efforts to demonize the movement on unfounded accusations of race, all the while ignoring the fundamental concerns of a majority of the electorate is a prescription for disaster.

                President Obama is a man who rarely loses his cool. He’s a smooth customer who is able to charm with his words and moves – except when the audience is Fox News’ Bret Baier.

During his exclusive interview with President Obama, which aired on Fox News earlier this week, Baier, one of the sharpest and fairest journalists in the business deftly exposed a side of the President that the public rarely sees.

This rare window showcased a dismissive, pestered and unprepared commander in chief. When asked about how Democrats were planning on passing the unpopular health care bill, Obama wore his annoyance with Baier on his sleeve, and was resistant to engage with specificity. Baier, unwilling to back down, cornered him on the manipulative legislative tactics being employed by his party.

“If they vote against, then they're going to be voting against health care reform and they're going to be voting in favor of the status quo,” Obama said. “So Washington gets very concerned about these procedural issues in Congress… ”

Rules, schmooles, says the President.

He seemed unconcerned with the shenanigans of Democratic leadership and process, refusing to respond to Baier’s questions about tricks like the Slaughter Strategy, except to say the process was “ugly” no matter which party was in power.

Mr. President, you are the commander in chief and you campaigned on changing the culture of Washington, not riding shotgun to it.

Baier was firm, respectful and persistent. He pressed him on process and policy; Obama was devoid on details for both. For someone who has been working on this effort for over a year, you’d think Obama would have a better handle on the policy but instead, the process has been so convoluted, so complicated, and so perverse it was apparent that even he can’t keep up with the talking points.

He also, unintentionally, revealed that he is unsure what’s even in the legislation.

“By the time the vote has taken place, not only I will know what's in it, you'll know what's in it because it's going to be posted and everybody's going to be able to able to evaluate it on the merits,” Obama answered.

Shouldn’t we -- and shouldn’t the president -- know what’s in it before it passes?

In typical Obama fashion he tried to stonewall his interregator and run out the clock, but Baier – the only anchor to do so thus far -- rightly called him out on his trademark filibustering, in other words talking at length to prevent Baier from challenging him on his verbose responses. It was the most uncomfortable moment of the segment, and Baier should be proud. That took guts.

The interview was more than telling, it was symbolic. The contrast of Baier’s peak performace revealed an Obama at a career low. His questions revealed the uncertainty of our leader -- and thus the direction of our country, and reflected the mood of man whose presidency is on the line.

              President Trump should adopt first lady Nancy Reagan’s famous anti-drug slogan in his current fight with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. When asked to testify in Mueller’s Russia probe, Trump should “just say no.”
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Based on the Monday New York Times story headlined “The Questions Mueller Wants to Ask Trump About Obstruction, and What They Mean,” by Matt Apuzzo and Michael S. Schmidt, many of the questions Mueller wants to ask President Trump are absurd. They are clearly a trap to establish a case for obstruction of justice or perjury.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Virtually no one could answer these questions with any certainty of detail. Consider this one: “What did you think about Mr. Comey’s intelligence briefing on Jan. 6, 2017, about Russian election interference?”
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump has spent more than 400 days in office, and Mueller would like him to accurately recall his thoughts about a particular meeting on a particular day.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Remember, this is not a casual conversation. This is a criminal investigation seeking to use the full force of law to lock people up – just ask former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn or Vice President Dick Cheney’s former Chief of Staff Scooter Libby, who was trapped into perjuring himself during the Valerie Plame case.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Why would we think that a president who is currently handling North Korea, Iran, China, Russia, Syria, tax cuts, health care reform, state visits and other presidential duties is going to have the ability (or the time) to remember with absolute clarity and accuracy what happened 16 months ago?
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              You can be sure, Mueller will have interviewed everyone he could find who heard President Trump react to the meeting with Comey 16 months ago. Mueller will have transcripts of everything President Trump has said and tweeted about that meeting. He will have the endless interviews with Comey. Mueller will then listen to the president and use any error of memory or effort to embellish to manufacture an obstruction or perjury charge.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              Ask yourself: Could you reliably remember every detail of a meeting you had at a particular time 16 months ago – and the totality of your reactions to it?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Why would we think that a president who is currently handling North Korea, Iran, China, Russia, Syria, tax cuts, health care reform, state visits and other presidential duties is going to have the ability (or the time) to remember with absolute clarity and accuracy what happened 16 months ago?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Mueller expands the absurdity with his follow-on question: “What was your reaction to Mr. Comey’s briefing that day about other intelligence matters?”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Consider how many intelligence briefings President Trump has received since then. Consider how many different conversations the president has had with a wide range of people about the so-called Steele dossier (reportedly the topic of that meeting). Again, Mueller will have interviewed people, recorded their versions, and will be prepared to measure the president’s memory against any slippage, error or misstatement.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Andy McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor who has written extensively and wisely on this case, warned in a recent column that “the rules of the game are that Democrats get away with murder while Republicans get murdered.”

              McCarthy was comparing the treatment of the Obama campaign’s Federal Election Commission violations with what is being done to the Trump campaign. His analysis also applies to the effort to protect Hillary Clinton (no matter how many clear criminal actions she and her team have committed) with the elaborate effort to take down President Trump – no matter how often the left’s conspiracy theories fall apart.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Alan Dershowitz, a distinguished Harvard law professor and civil libertarian, has warned about prosecutors with a wide net who seek to entrap people: “It was Lavrentiy Beria (chief of the Soviet secret police) who told Stalin, ‘show me the man, and I’ll find your crime.’ You can go through the federal criminal code and find crimes that virtually any businessman, any politician has committed,” Dershowitz stated on MSNBC.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Dershowitz also warned: “I do not trust the government. I do not trust judges. I do not trust prosecutors when they are zealously seeking to go after a particular target, in this case Donald Trump. Nobody would have been going after Michael Cohen if he weren’t Donald Trump’s lawyer. That’s the reality.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              McCarthy made the case for Nancy Reagan’s “just say no” strategy in a column earlier this week, writing: “Trump would be foolish to answer questions from Mueller, who has made a habit of turning witness interviews into false-statements prosecutions. More important, absent concrete evidence of his complicity in a serious crime, a president should not be put in the position of being pressured to answer a prosecutor’s questions. When Trump complains that the Obama Justice Department would never have permitted President Obama to be treated this way, he is right….
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “Unless Mueller can demonstrate that a serious crime has been committed, that Trump was complicit in it, and that Trump is in possession of evidence that is essential to the prosecution, (Deputy Attorney General Rod) Rosenstein should bar him from seeking an interview, let alone issuing a subpoena demanding grand-jury testimony. This is not merely about protecting Trump; it is about protecting the office of the presidency.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Earlier in the piece, McCarthy pointed out that the questions Mueller reportedly wants to ask the president indicate that there is no evidence of a crime and that Mueller is just wanting to “probe the chief executive’s motives and thought processes regarding exercises of presidential power that were lawful.…”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              McCarthy noted: “If Bob Mueller wants that kind of control over the executive branch, he should run for president. Otherwise, he is an inferior executive official who has been given a limited license – ultimately, by the chief executive – to investigate crime. If he doesn’t have an obvious crime, he has no business inventing one, much less probing his superior’s judgment. He should stand down.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In an echo of Dershowitz’s reference to Stalin-era prosecutions, McCarthy warns: “The criminal law inquires into intent when actions patently violate criminal statutes; its purpose is not to manufacture crime by speculating about the intent behind apparently lawful actions.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The patterns that McCarthy and Dershowitz describe are beginning to be more apparent. For example, a federal judge has accused Mueller’s team of using the case against former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort to target the president.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to Fox News, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III told Mueller’s team Friday: “You don't really care about Mr. Manafort…. You really care about what information Mr. Manafort can give you to lead you to Mr. Trump and an impeachment, or whatever.""
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Judge Ellis has questioned Mueller’s authority to prosecute Manafort on a number of charges related to an earlier Justice Department probe. He ordered Mueller to supply an unredacted document detailing the scope of Mueller’s investigation – the same document the Justice Department has previously declined to supply to House Republicans.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It is exactly this pattern of prosecutorial targeting that led former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now on the president’s legal defense team, to tell the Daily Beast: “Anybody who says that I’m exaggerating when I say that this is an out-of-control investigation and they’re acting like storm troopers – give me a break, baby! They prove it every day.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              ""I contend the only crimes committed so far in this investigation are the ones they committed, the government committed,"" Giuliani added.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A close friend, who is a great litigator, suggested to me that President Trump should end the speculation with this statement:
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              ""My lawyers tell me this is a farce, and when you see the proposed questions, you can see they are. So, I am not going to spend any time on it, and I am not going to answer their silly questions. I'll leave it all up to the lawyers to give you the legalese, and I am sure there will be plenty. But, that's for them. I have a great country to lead. So, just talk to them.""
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “Just say no” is the only plausible answer to the Mueller fishing expedition.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein must finally do his job and stop Mueller from seeking to subpoena the president or take him before a grand jury. Mueller is only as outrageous and out of control as Rosenstein tolerates. So Rosenstein also has to learn from Nancy Reagan and “just say no” to Mueller’s power grab as well.

JUAN WILLIAMS: Will Herman Cain Be the Big Story of the 2012 Election?,"Raise your hand if you think Herman Cain won Fox News Channel’s debate last week among contenders for the GOP’s 2012 presidential nomination?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Frank Luntz, the bestselling author and GOP pollster, held an instant focus group after the debate which overwhelmingly declared the Cain the winner. ""In all the years I have been doing this, I have never seen a reaction like this to a debate.” Luntz exclaimed. “Something very special happened here tonight.”                
                

            
                Traffic and contributions to Cain’s website have increased sharply in the days since the debate. The conservative media, particularly the blogosphere, were praising the 65-year-old talk radio host from Georgia all weekend. On Friday, the date after the debate, he won a presidential straw poll at a Washington state GOP convention and drew a crowd of several hundred people in Las Vegas.                
                

            
                As one of the moderators for that debate, I am very surprised at the rave reviews for Cain – both in the media and in Greenville that night.                
                

            
                I first realized that Cain was the winner when my colleague Shannon Bream and I were discussing on stage the question of which candidate did best at the debate. She said her dad texted her at the end of the debate – while she was still on stage -- to tell her that Herman Cain won. That prompted me to conduct my own informal, post-debate survey of people in the auditorium and back at the hotel. When I asked them who won the debate, almost every one responded ‘Herman Cain.’                
                

            
                Herman Cain? When he was asked about what to do in Afghanistan he had no answer other than to set a priority, get good people around him to study the problem and act decisively. That was his answer to almost every tough question and to my mind it amounted to a non-answer.                
                

            
                But obviously I am missing something.                
                

            
                I have always been impressed by Cain as a man with a wonderful personal story of cancer survival and a black man who made his way in American business despite high levels of racial bias when he was in the middle of his career in the 1980s.                 
                

            
                He is best known as the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza where he is credited with saving the pizza chain from bankruptcy in the 1990s and making it profitable. Cain has extensive experience in the corporate world and even served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City.                
                

            
                He has recently mastered the one-liners and fiery talk of conservative talk radio but Cain also holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a master’s degree in computer science.                
                

            
                Cain made his debut on the national political stage back in 1994 when he challenged President Clinton on his health care reform package during a televised town hall. The video of the exchange is readily available on YouTube. Cain claimed that Clinton’s health care proposal would cause businesses like his to fire their employees go in order to offset the cost of an insurance mandate for employers.                
                

            
                When Clinton defended his proposal, Cain confidentially responded ""Quite honestly, your calculation is inaccurate…In the competitive marketplace it simply doesn't work that way.” His schooling of the president made him a conservative celebrity.                
                

            
                While he has charisma and an impressive business resume, he has never held elected office before. When my pal, Chris Wallace, asked him about that at the debate, he had one of the evening’s most memorable answers:                
                

            
                “I’m proud of the fact that I haven’t held public office before. Most of the people that are in elected office in Washington DC, they have held public office before. How’s that workin’ for you? We have a mess. How about sending a problem-solver to the White House?”                
                

            
                Maybe I was too close to last week’s Republican presidential primary debate to offer an objective assessment. His one-liners were good but I did not feel that he demonstrated any facility with discussion of serious topics like foreign affairs.                
                

            
                Dave Funk, a prominent Republican Party official in Iowa, was quoted in a Wall Street Journal profile of Cain expressing a similar impression. ""Herman is a great speaker and makes a great first impression,"" he noted. ""But what I don't see yet is a great deal of depth on things like Afghanistan and national defense.""                
                

            
                But among conservative activists and Tea Party groups across the nation, the people who know him best, Cain is known and respected for his thinking as much for his fiery, impassioned speeches at rallies and conferences. So it is a mistake to underestimate Cain. He could be the story of this election cycle.                
                

            
                It is still a long way to the nomination. But Herman Cain is now a player. And this year’s GOP nomination is still being baked. The question now is will the former pizza mogul be able to deliver?

A second chance to get America's health care right: Give authority to our states,"Health care reform has dominated our nation’s political and social conversations for the past six years. After the implementation of ObamaCare, it is clear the law brought radical change and real pain to our nation’s families, economy, and health care system. The promised ""affordable health care fix"" made things worse.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The pending King v. Burwell case reveals another interesting legal problem with the policy and text of the Affordable Care Act. As written, the federally controlled subsidies and employer mandates are not allowed, unless a state chooses them. Now the Supreme Court debates, behind closed doors, the question of state responsibility and textual intent to determine the direction of health care in America. The resulting Supreme Court opinion could dismantle the structure of ObamaCare and give America a second chance to get health care reform right.                  
                

            
                Ironically, the issue of state responsibility could take ObamaCare down and lift individual citizens up.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            States are generally more effective regulators than the federal government. Allowing states to assume responsibility and maintain authority moves people from numbers on a spreadsheet to neighbors down the street. 
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                The Constitution gives states the power to regulate health care within their state and voluntarily compact with other states, but the federal government has attempted to preempt state action by assuming centralized control. What is needed is clear legislation that affirms the right of states to compact with one another to return authority for health care regulation to states that choose to participate.                
                

            
                Interstate compacts have been used on more than 200 occasions to establish agreements between and among states. Mentioned in Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution, state compacts provide authority and flexibility to administer government programs without federal interference. In the Compact structure, federal health care tax money and responsibility is returned to a state when they expand their existing Healthcare Authority structure.  Congressional consent is extended when states enter into a legally binding compact. It is similar to a multitude of other grants made by the federal government to states and local entities.                
                

            
                Complexity empowers big government, simplicity empowers families and local leaders.  Giving health care authority to states is simple and beneficial because they are able to enact accountability, efficiencies and tailor their system to fit the exact needs of their population. One size does not fit all – ObamaCare proves that. The health challenges and population needs of Vermont or California are not the same as Texas or Oklahoma.                  
                

            
                Why should bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. manage all health care systems the same way?                
                

            
                Health care is large, complex, and challenging to manage at the federal level. With a federal system that impacts over 300 million people, $2.3 trillion spent annually and almost 3,000 pages of regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, federal management of our health care system is inefficient and virtually occluded from individualized input. The Medicare fraud rate has hovered around 10 percent for decades, with over $50 billion in annual lost tax money.  Big systems allow massive financial loss and make individual citizens small.                  
                

            
                States are generally more effective regulators than the federal government. Allowing states to assume responsibility and maintain authority moves people from numbers on a spreadsheet to neighbors down the street. Rural health care struggles to get the attention of federal agencies, but they would have the consistent ear of state agencies.                 
                

            
                Some people assume only people in Washington, D.C. care about the health needs of people across the nation, but we can assure you that state leaders and state agencies deeply care for their neighbors and want to find ways to help them. In fact, before the Affordable Care Act passed, our states had already initiated systems to care for those without health care. Unfortunately, the state solutions were forced out when ObamaCare took over.                
                

            
                The Compact is an option that ensures the people of each state will have a choice. States can opt in to the Compact – or not.  To date, the Health Care Compact has been formally requested by 9 states – Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah – and several other states are considering it.                  
                

            
                As Congress works towards solutions to the problems created by the top-down approach of ObamaCare, we want to let states innovate to serve their citizens’ health care needs.  When the Supreme Court rules on King v. Burwell in favor of state responsibility, we want to let states innovate ways to serve their citizens’ health care.

                All good political dramas feature hair-raising narrow escapes from the claws of policy defeat and the jaws of political death.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                If President Obama wants to survive this summer of political drama over health care he will have to do an Indiana Jones exit from the temple of his doom as poll numbers are collapsing around him and newly energized political opponents go in for the “kill” as they smell his blood in the water.                
                

            
                How can he start a comeback? It is all or nothing right now with Wednesday night’s speech to Congress.                
                

            
                The president has to play to his political strength; specifically the trust the American voter has in him to do what is right on health care. When it comes to commanding public trust on healthcare Republicans in Congress, even Democrats in Congress, do not come close to President Obama.
Insurance companies, drug companies, big business also can’t compete with President Obama when it comes to trust.                
                

            
                To quote Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew polling outfit: “For all the public’s reservations about health care reform…Barack Obama continues to enjoy the confidence of a majority of the public with regard to this issue.” In hard poll numbers from Pew a majority, 56 percent of Americans, say they believe the president is looking out for them on health care. Only 45 percent of Americans have such confidence in Congressional Democrats. Even fewer, 39 percent, have any fair in Congressional Republicans to improve the health care system.                
                

            
                CBS News poll numbers also show that a majority of Americans continue to want health care reform. Fifty-four percent agreed when CBS asked: “if there are no government reforms the health care system will get worse.” More than 80 percent, in that same poll agreed that they “see the U.S. health care system as needing major changes.” And nearly 80 percent told the CBS pollsters they want insurance companies to cover “anyone who applies for health insurance regardless of whether or not they have a pre-existing medical condition.”                
                

            
                What is clear on this political map is that most Americans trust one person above all others on health care reform -- President Obama -- and most Americans want health care reform.                
                

            
                But the polling also indicates that two-thirds of Americans are confused by all the health care reform ideas. They fear that the cost of getting medical care will go up, that it will be harder to get an appointment to see the doctor and the overall quality of care will go down if the proposals now in Congress are put into action. Polls also show that most Americans cannot tell you what they most dislike or like about the health care proposals being circulated.                
                

            
                So Americans want reform but they are uninformed and scared. The one person they trust is not saying anything concrete about what is best. -- He only takes time to tell them that his critics are not telling the truth. -- That is a waste of the trust invested in him. That is why the president’s approval ratings on health care are falling fast, threatening to take his whole administration down and sink the Democrats in next year’s midterms.                
                

            
                This means President Obama has to give a speech Wednesday night in which he lives up to the trust given to him by the American people and takes control of a haywire debate over health care.                
                

            
                He has to tell the majority who trust him more than anyone else on this subject to ignore diversions and scare tactics with catch phrases like “death panels,” “rationing” and cries about future tax hikes caused by budget busting deficit spending on health care.                
                

            
                In order to do all of this he has to say is that he has an idea for an all-American health care system that is better than the existing one. Then he needs to specifically lay out that plan in simple terms. And if it means telling people they will have to pay more for health insurance as a matter of common sacrifice for the common good of all Americans then he should say it. He should also say it may mean higher taxes on people who earn less than $250,000.                
                

            
                And if we, the American people, have to pay more then tell us that it is because our personal best interest is best served by having fewer uninsured people and under-insured people jammed into our emergency room and driving up the cost of medicine, hospitals and the price of health insurance.                
                

            
                Tell people who are being scared off by the prospect of bigger health care prices under reform that they are already paying that money out every single day without fixing the problem. And tell them that the problem is going to get worse and more expensive without serious, caring people standing up to address the problem now.                
                

            
                He can say he is open to negotiations about specific ideas but make it clear that the idea of a public health insurance plan or so-called public option is key to making health insurance coverage more easily accessible to more people. It is not intended to put anyone out of business or make insurance more expensive and if the president has the evidence that it won’t he needs to say so and say it loud.                
                

            
                The next step for President Obama to escape his summer of peril is to celebrate his identity as a centrist political leader who genuinely cares about what is best for America. He ran and won the presidency as a centrist. Yes, he has lots of liberal friends and a liberal voting record in the U.S. Senate. Yes, he even has radical friends and appointees like the recently resigned Van Jones.                
                

            
                But his political future is tied to electorate’s middle and when his approval numbers go down it is because of loss of faith from that middle. Democrats and liberals are not abandoning the president on health care. -- Even among conservatives and Republicans only 33 percent and 36 percent respectively, according to the CBS poll, describe themselves as “angry” about the president’s handling of the healthcare debate.                
                

            
                As a crusading champion of the American middle the president needs to launch into the insurance companies, the drug companies, the hospital groups and all the lobbyists who are happy to make money bleeding any business offering health insurance to their employees and bankrupting anyone who gets sick or has a sick parent, spouse -- any relative.                
                

            
                Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel made a mistake by trying to cut private deals with the insurance companies and drug companies before the public debate. It has not stopped the forces of support for the status quo from working against change; it has only freed them from being called out as selfish, greedy fiends who have quietly plotted to scare people by having their political pals to talk about death panels and socialized medicine.                
                

            
                Mr. President, tell stories about people who don’t get health care right now because they’ve been denied coverage despite paying years of insurance bills. Have a mom stand next to you and explain that she works as a waitress and can’t get health care coverage to pay for back-to-school immunizations for her kids. Have an elderly person stand with you and, with tears falling, recount the painful choice between of buying high-priced medicine and missing a meal.                
                

            
                Have someone who lost a limb to diabetes tell the story of how their diagnosis came too late for anything but amputation because they did not have the money or the insurance coverage to see a doctor before they nearly died.                
                

            
                This is the speech that will be a first step to escape a summer of doom. The sequel will be how the president twists arms among fellow Democrats, energizes churches, doctors, civil rights groups, the media, big political donors, unions, the Internet, students, and more to raise their voices and help him now.                
                

            
                Even the president needs help to stay alive on the politically treacherous terrain surrounding health care reform but it all starts with a speech in which he helps himself.

5 Reasons Why Democrats are the REAL 'Party of No',"Heading toward November’s midterm elections, Republicans are gaining strength as the party shouting “Enough!” while Democrats look more like the real “Party of No.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                On April 19, 2009 on ABC’s “This Week,” White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel slapped a label on Republicans that stuck when he said, “…when you're the party of 'no'; when you're the party of never; when you're the party of no new ideas, that's not constructive.”                
                

            
                But Emanuel’s invective has boomeranged. He’s leaving his job to run (run away from President Obama’s sinking administration?) for mayor of Chicago. Meantime, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds that the Tea Party movement’s “push to cut spending and oppose the Democratic agenda” is shaking up the images and positions of both parties in a protest of “business as usual.” The Journal writes, “The most popular issue motivating [the Tea Party movement] is cutting government spending and debt, followed by reducing the size of government.”                
                

            
                On these and other issues, the Democrats are showing themselves to be the real “Party of No” for five reasons:                
                

            
                1. No end to out-of-control spending. The president and Democrats continue on an unsustainable spender bender. They’re driving under the influence of spendaholic lawmakers like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, labor unions, AIG, green extremists, and a variety of other protected and paid off special interest groups eagerly feeding from the big government trough. The $13.4-trillion debt bomb the Democrats have strapped on the country threatens to blow up, putting America at the mercy of its foreign creditors and risking our national solvency.                
                

            
                2. No tax relief. Americans don’t know what tax burden they’ll face in 2011. Democrats in the House and Senate pushed off until after the November 2 elections a vote on extending across-the-board Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire at year-end. By punting the question of the size and scope of taxes until a “lame duck” session after the midterm elections, Democrats add to the uncertainty bedeviling the stalled economy.                 
                

            
                Upper income small business owners (who employ 25% of the U.S. workforce), and investors are sitting on trillions in cash. They don’t want to hire, expand, finance or spend with a tax Sword of Damocles hanging over them.                 
                

            
                Tax uncertainty is also hurting spending and planning by consumers in lower tax brackets. Many voters will resent that Democrats are playing political games in a futile attempt to avoid looking like tax and spenders going into Election Day. Democratic dithering also means that several members of Congress who lose will still cast a vote on a key tax matter after the elections but before they formally leave office.                
                

            
                3. No recovery. The Democrats’ “summer of recovery” has become the voters’ “autumn of outrage.” Voters are exhausted, frustrated and irate about a stimulus that didn’t stimulate, millions of jobs “saved or created” only in Vice President Biden’s imagination, and an economy that draws this blunt assessment from legendary investor Warren Buffet: “We’re still in a recession.""                
                

            
                4. No credibility on health care reform. All the early indications on Obamacare are that it increases costs, insurance premiums, mandates, burdens on small businesses, restrictions on treatments, bureaucratic controls, and limitations on doctor-patient choices. It decreases competition and innovation such as the development of breakthrough medicines and new, cutting edge medical procedures and practices.                
                

            
                5. No security rewards from appeasing enemies and squeezing allies. Iran, terrorists who are at large or apprehended, Russia, North Korea and America’s many other adversaries worldwide are becoming more defiant. They’re emboldened by President Obama’s unrequited apologies, concessions, slap-on-the-wrist gestures, legal softness and “diplomatic overtures” to those seeking to kill U.S. citizens generally and, in particular, Jews.                 
                

            
                Obama’s weakness in standing up to hostile powers that use or develop lethal weapons against America and its allies (including nuclear build-ups and terrorist acts) threatens American forces, civilians at home, and U.S. friends, including Israel, Poland and the Czech Republic.                
                

            
                And why stop at five? Add Democratic “no” lapses on issues such as illegal immigration, corruption by elected and appointed officials, school choice, and entitlement reform into the mix. -- This gives Republicans the opportunity to embrace an identity as the “party of enough!” going into the midterm elections and to disgrace Democrats as the “party of no,” and one which is seriously undermining economic and national security.                
                

            
                Whatever happens on Election Day, voters are already signaling a message of “no”: no more excuses, just results, from whoever wins.

"President, Dems own ObamaCare disaster despite lame talking points","Now Playing                            Hannity: Breaking down the ObamaCare disaster                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                A desperate President Obama went to Capitol Hill Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to try and save his disastrous health care law, but all he managed to do was get left-wing lawmakers to back the monumental failure with old, tired and divisive rhetoric.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                They want to scare the American people because Republicans want to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But all they can offer are lame talking points.                
                

            
                “The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn't make America great again, it would make America sick again,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.                
                

            
                Democrats were so proud of the clever play on Trump’s campaign slogan that each one rushed to the podium to repeat it. Over and over.                
                

            
                But while Democrats were pointing fingers and spouting canned lines, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was meeting with Republicans to formulate a real plan to repeal and replace the disastrous law.                
                

            
                “The first order of business is to repeal and replace ObamaCare,” Pence reasoned. “ObamaCare has failed. And the American people have sent a decisive message to Washington, D.C., that they want ObamaCare to be repealed and replaced with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.”                
                

            
                Republicans need to make sure they keep their promises and move quickly to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But they also need to be careful, because Democrats have already shown they are not going to blame themselves when ObamaCare finally dies and crumbles.                
                

            
                President-elect Trump warned the GOP in a tweet that, ""Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases, like the 116 percent hike in Arizona Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web.""                
                

            
                Trump is 100 percent right. Republicans need to make President Obama and the Democrats own every lie they told, every failed promise they didn't keep. And there were a bunch of them.                
                

            
                “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period,” Obama said on June 15, 2009. “If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period.”                
                

            
                Two months later, he said, “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.”                
                

            
                Obama promised that the average family would save $2,500 per year. Well, since 2009, the average American family is paying $4,100 more for health care.                
                

            
                We also know that millions of Americans lost their doctors and their plans or both. And that is just the start of this ObamaCare disaster.                
                

            
                Here's what the president and Democrats own, because remember, not a single Republican voted for this law: ObamaCare premiums this year along are increasing by 25 percent on average. Premiums on average for a family of four making $60,000 a year will spike by 43.6 percent. Deductibles for the same group are exploding by 22.9 percent.                
                

            
                The misery doesn't end there. The president promised free-market competition and choices for Americans on the exchanges, but the opposite has happened. Major insurers like Humana, Aetna, United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield are all pulling out of states because they are losing money on the exchanges. Humana alone lost over $1 billion just for participating in ObamaCare. In states like Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, people have only one insurer to choose from now.                
                

            
                And then there's all the taxes. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has previously found that the middle class will face $377 billion in tax increases, courtesy of ObamaCare. According to a recent study, the surging ObamaCare premiums will cost American taxpayers an extra $9.8 billion this year alone.                
                

            
                The negative impact of ObamaCare is obvious, and it helped propel President-elect Trump to victory. Sure, there are certain aspects of the law that Republicans will keep, like coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26. But ObamaCare itself is a single, fundamental, massive big government failure that needs to be completely scrapped and redone. American consumers deserve better care, free-market competition and lower costs.

                President Obama recently sat down for a long, wide-ranging interview with Thomas Friedman, the New York Times’ premier columnist and multiple Pulitzer Prize winner. It was supposed to be an elevated discussion between two intellectuals about the weighty foreign policy issues not just of the day, but of the modern era. Obama kept referring to broad, sweeping words of wisdom – the deal with Iran is a “once in a lifetime” chance. He hinted at a similar deal with Cuba.

                And he announced, “You asked about an Obama doctrine. The doctrine is: We will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities.”

                It was vintage Obama – vague, but important sounding. It could mean whatever you wanted it to mean. Anyone could read into it what he wanted. It would mean all things to all people. It was a Rorschach test: How you interpreted it depended more on what you thought than what he said. It was complete gobbledygook.                
                

            
                The Obama administration has spent six years in search of a doctrine worthy of the Chosen One. At first it was “Leading from Behind.” But that didn’t work, because rather than take our cue, others rushed to fill the void created by our withdrawal from the front of the pack.                
                

            
                Then it was “don’t do stupid stuff.” But the administration kept doing stupid stuff, like the premature withdrawal from Iraq that gave birth to ISIS, or the Libyan war that left the country in jihadi chaos, or the decision to blame the Benghazi terrorist attacks on an obscure YouTube video.                
                

            
                More recently, the Obama administration claimed its doctrine was “strategic patience” and made references to the great arc of history bending in our direction. But that’s like saying – even though the world seems to be “exploding all over,” to quote former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel – don’t worry, everything will turn out well in the end. It’s basing America’s national security on “fingers crossed.”                
                

            
                The president talks in every speech about the “global community” and the “rules-based international community.” He puts his faith in the creation of new entities based on common interests and shared values to deal with everything from governing the Internet to global warming. He believes that if America takes a step back, other nations will step forward and planetary kumbaya will ensue.                 
                

            
                Sadly, we have seen that the alternative to American leadership isn’t world peace, but rising regional hegemonies – or even worse, chaos. China, Russia, Iran and the Islamic State don’t want to play by our rules. They want to kick over the global chessboard and establish their own rules.                
                

            
                Previous attempts at an Obama Doctrine had come from White House aides or Cabinet officers, but in his interview with Friedman Obama himself took a turn at defining the Obama Doctrine. Doubtless, it was focus-group tested and designed to offend the fewest people. It sounds like we want to stay involved in world affairs, but not expend too much effort. It’s so vacuous, it’s meaningless.                
                

            
                Compare this to James Monroe’s doctrine that great powers should stay out of our hemisphere, or Theodore Roosevelt’s “speak softly and carry a big stick,” or Ronald Reagan’s Peace through Strength. Those were unambiguous. They made clear that we did not seek war, but we would remain strong enough to defend ourselves if necessary.                
                

            
                President Obama is about to get his nuclear deal with Iran, which he believes will be the crowning achievement of his historic, transformational presidency. Yet wise and respected diplomats like former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, who are no strangers to historic treaties, have warned that the agreement will not do what he has promised. Instead of preventing a nuclear arms race, it will have the opposite effect, and nuclear weapons will spread throughout the Middle East.                
                

            
                President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are in search of greatness. The president will sign an agreement with Iran on behalf of the United States but without the concurrence of its elected representatives. In effect, that allows Iran to get nuclear weapons and ignites a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.                
                

            
                Presumably, the president believes that if he grants Iran this right, its leaders will have a sudden change of heart on their terrorist ways, stop chanting “death to America” and abandon their goal of “annihilating Israel.”                
                

            
                But if he is wrong, he has just bet America’s security, and the world’s, on an agreement that can neither be adequately verified nor successfully enforced with a handful of messianic mullahs who are convinced they’ve been chosen to rule the world.                
                

            
                If so, others will write the Obama Doctrine, and it won’t be pretty. President Obama will be known as the man who allowed nuclear weapons into the Middle East in exchange for one vainglorious moment.                 
                

            
                In 1938 British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain traveled to Munich to sign a pact with Adolph Hitler. Chamberlain returned to London to cheers, parades and congratulations, declaring he had achieved “peace in our time.” A year later, however, the very war he’d been seeking to avoid had begun. Chamberlain’s naiveté and appeasement policy were blamed for one of the world’s most devastating and destructive wars. The threats we face today are even more ominous -- Hitler never got his hands on nuclear weapons.                
                

            
                If, in a few years, the Middle East is awash in nuclear materials and weapons of mass destruction, the likelihood they will be used will go up exponentially – whether they’re used intentionally, accidentally or even inadvertently. If so, the blame will fall squarely on Obama’s shoulders. Chamberlain’s capitulation and folly will look minor compared to his.                
                

            
                Then we will finally have an explanation of the Obama Doctrine. President Obama’s legacy will not be “peace in our time.” It will be introducing nuclear weapons into the most unstable and dangerous part of the planet into the hands of people who will not hesitate to use them."
CBO score: An opportunity for Republicans to get serious about making state-led health care reform work,"Republicans have tasked themselves with fixing ObamaCare—repealing and replacing it with something better, that lowers premiums and offers greater choice, without pulling the rug out from under the millions of Americans who have gained coverage under the law.  
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                Reading Wednesday’s Congressional Budget Office score of the American Health Care Act, you’d think this was Mission Impossible, and that states would “race to the bottom” in pursuing waivers that would give them more flexibility in how insurance is priced and regulated. CBO projects, for instance, that costs for older or sicker patients could rise sharply for patients living in states that pursued the most aggressive waivers.
                
                


                
            
                The CBO’s job is to score legislation as written—and they’ve certainly pointed out some shortcomings in how the AHCA is currently structured. But CBO has also highlighted key improvements Republicans in the Senate could make to stabilize markets: increasing reinsurance funding for high-cost patients, offering means-tested cost sharing subsidies for the low-income uninsured, and strengthening incentives for young, healthy populations to get and hold coverage. 
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            The Dept. of Health and Human Services could be tasked with studying, in real time, the effects of state waivers on important measures like access to care, health outcomes, and out of pocket costs.
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
            
                Taken together, these three fixes would enable states to experiment with more affordable plan designs while still providing robust coverage to patients with expensive pre-existing conditions.     
                
                


                
            
                The Republicans are on the right track in one critical respect, noted in the latest CBO score.  Although the coverage score still gives many pause (23 million more uninsured compared to the ACA by 2026), CBO projects that both the AHCA's Patient and State Stability Fund and the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program would help to put downward pressure on premiums. 
                
                


                
            
                Well-designed and well-funded risk pools or reinsurance would certainly go a long way in stabilizing state insurance markets. By offsetting claims associated with high cost patients, these programs can lower premiums across the board, keeping them affordable for the vast majority of healthy enrollees. The AHCA’s programs simply need more funding (some estimates have suggested $15-20 billion annually.)
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                The next step is to offer cost sharing subsidies for lower income enrollees, in addition to the AHCA’s flat tax credit. Adding means-tested cost-sharing subsidies will help keep coverage within reach for the populations who need it most. As long as cost sharing subsidies are available for these populations, higher deductible or catastrophic plans could offer lower premiums for healthier enrollees who just need protection against major medical events.
                
                


                
            
                Finally, the Senate needs to address the AHCA’s penalty for going without coverage. CBO expects that, as currently structured, the law would encourage younger, healthier enrollees to stay uninsured because the penalty for going without coverage is too weak. In this respect, it suffers from the same problem as ObamaCare, which hasn’t attracted enough young, healthy enrollees. 
                
                


                
            
                The truth is, no one really knows a single, blanket solution for this problem. The best approach is to allow the states to come up with their own coverage strategies. Some might choose auto-enrollment in a zero-deductible catastrophic plan, larger or longer penalties for buying coverage after you become sick, or other approaches. Over time, we could learn what works best. 
                
                


                
            
                The Senate can also reassure skeptics of state flexibility by explicitly including guardrails that help protect patients, and ensure that states focus on meeting clear goals for vulnerable populations. 
                
                


                
            
                The Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, could be tasked with studying, in real time, the effects of state waivers on important measures like access to care, health outcomes, and out of pocket costs. HHS could also help states model and evaluate waiver proposals, collect data, and ensure greater transparency around health plan costs and quality.
                
                


                
            
                Congress should also tie reinsurance funding to states reforming their health care markets to promote competition and transparency—helping patients and consumers to find providers who deliver better care at lower cost.
                
                


                
            
                ObamaCare’s one-size-fits-all plan design has driven up costs, and locked healthier patients out of the market. States should be encouraged to make greater use of health savings accounts, allow insurers to design different cost sharing or provider networks within established categories of essential health benefits that provide comparable access to care at lower cost, and offer more value-based insurance designs that waive co-pays or deductibles for high value services. 
                
                


                
            
                House Speaker Paul Ryan, speaking at an Axios event recently, said, “Let's just pay for the people who are catastrophically ill. Let's just do that. Because I don't think anybody, Republican, Democrat, whatever, thinks that if a person gets breast cancer in her 40s, she should go bankrupt for getting it."" 
                
                


                
            
                He’s right. Doing so will not only allow Republicans to answer serious critics of the AHCA, but empower states to find ways to supercharge health care competition that improves health outcomes at less cost to patients and taxpayers.   
                
                


                
            
                The CBO score isn’t cause for abandoning waivers. It’s a call to get serious about making them work.

                In January I wrote the following piece for the Fox Forum: ""Why Doctors are Abandoning Medicare."" The primary reason? Washington views the common physician as the enemy—as purely mercenary. Given this, lawmakers should not be surprised that recent surveys suggest nearly one doctor in three—one third of all physicians—would consider leaving medicine if the proposed health care legislation passed. Now that the health care bill is law, the question becomes, how will these physicians escape?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This past year Americans witnessed countless discussions about health care reform. Yet no one even tacitly addressed the elephant in the room—the burden of unnecessary overhead costs.
Trapped under mountains of paperwork and handcuffed to inefficient billing and collection systems, the average medical practice must hire four support staff for every working physician. Bloated regulation and abusive government oversight threaten to compound this problem. In order to squeeze $500 billion out of Medicare spending, Washington will now target working physicians for alleged “fraud” (see ""Why Doctors are Abandoning Medicare"").                 
                

            
                To avoid running afoul of the ever-changing and byzantine Medicare guidelines, physician practices spend tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars on mechanisms to review their documentation and billing; hospitals hire non-medical staff to ensure charts contain the right words for Medicare compliance. The American health care system drowns in a sea of red tape.
Overhead now consumes 60% of the average physician’s collections. Because physicians only collect 60% of what they charge, this means they keep less than twenty-five cents of every dollar they bill. In other words, 75% of patient charges support system inefficiencies—not face-to-face time with the physician.                
                

            
                What if physicians could rid themselves of the lengthy chart reviews and painful court battles to defend themselves against abusive government audits? What if physicians actually had time to talk with patients and the freedom to use their best judgment rather than spend their time perfecting their documentation and getting permission to order a necessary test or use an effective drug?
What if physicians could avoid the hundreds of thousands of dollars of software needed to make sure their electronic charts matched the most recent iteration of the arcane Medicare guidelines?                 
                

            
                What if they didn’t have to hire billing and collection experts to fight the government and insurance companies to get reimbursed? What if physicians actually posted what they charged and got paid what they posted?                
                

            
                In short, what would happen if patients and their physician were really the only two parties sitting in the room? If this happened, medical care would cost far less and physicians could devote their energy to patient care, not to fighting an inefficient system.                
                

            
                What if I told you, some physicians can and a growing number do?                
                

            
                More and more primary care physicians, and some specialists, are moving their practices toward a truly free market model. By not signing contracts with Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance companies, physicians are freed to practice as they choose. By ridding themselves of massive regulatory nightmare that comes with such contracts, they can provide care at a fraction of the cost even as they spend more time with each patient.                
                

            
                For example, take Dr. Brian Forrest, a family practice physician in North Carolina. He signed no contracts with traditional insurance companies, Medicare, or Medicaid. Instead he has chosen to run a completely fee-for-service, pay-at-the-door practice. Guess what happened?                
                

            
                Rather than hiring four support staff for every provider, he has three providers and one support staff. Rather than collecting 60% of his billing and putting 60% of his collections toward overhead, he collects 99% of his billing and only pays 25% of this in overhead. Rather than needing to see 20 patients a day just to cover expenses, Dr. Forrest breaks even after the first four. This allows him to have 45-minute office visits earning him the designation of one of 26 Cardiovascular Centers of Excellence in the U.S.                
                

            
                Can the patient and the physician remain at the center of American medicine? Yes, if the government does not legislate the independent, Hippocratic physician out of practice. The practice model Dr. Forrest and his patients enjoy works best when combined with low cost/high deductible plans coupled with a Health Care Savings Account—something the recently passed legislation may soon destroy.                
                

            
                Next week, Physicians for Reform will launch a nationwide Physician Petition in its fight to preserve patient-centered health care. First, we must defund the 16,000 IRS agents assigned to enforce the current health care legislation. Second, we must repeal the current law. Finally, we must we must replace it with fiscally responsible reform.                
                

            
                The time has come when some physicians must close their doors to Medicare, Medicaid, and the entire insurance industry in order to ensure that the patient will remain at the center of American health care.

"Obama Choosing to ""Pass Over"" Israel","Obama’s desire to out-do past presidents in achieving breakthroughs where his predecessors failed is a laudable goal except that, as with health care reform, Obama cares less about the consequences of his actions and more about his reputation as a “transformational” leader whose will justifies any way.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                So strong is Obama’s desire to broker an historic formation of a Palestinian state that the president vilifies Israel over its plan to build 1,600 apartments in East Jerusalem—territory that Israel won in the 1967 Mideast war. In the Mexican-American War, ending in 1848, the United States won land that now comprises the states of California, Utah, and Nevada, as well as most of Arizona and New Mexico, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado. Is President Obama willing to give that land back to the Mexicans?                
                

            
                And since when has sacrificing “land for peace” resulted in anything other than sacrifices for Israel?                 
                

            
                As Mario Loyola points out in the National Review online: “Israel withdrew from south Lebanon in the interest of peace and got a second Lebanon war instead. It withdrew from most of the West Bank, and was repaid with a thousand Israeli civilians dead. It withdrew from Gaza, forcibly uprooting thousands of Jewish settlers, and the response was thousands of rockets fired at its civilian population, attacks that continue to this day. Still, despite these horrifying object lessons in the flaws of the ‘peace process,’ the Obama administration acts as if the peace process has no flaws at all and if Israel would just make a few more concessions, everything would be okay.”                
                

            
                U.S. officials describe the president as “livid” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu because of the East Jerusalem construction. Is Obama equally “livid” over the Iranians’ construction of nuclear weapons?                
                

            
                While Israel faces an existential threat from Iran and while the Palestinians persist in calling for Israel’s destruction, Obama repeatedly calls for Israel to make more “concessions” for the sake of a “peace process” while the Palestinians make no concessions. Last year the president warned Netanyahu not to surprise the U.S. with a military attack against Iran.                
                

            
                Put that together and Obama is asking Israel to meekly acquiesce to its sworn enemies and to make itself vulnerable to annihilation, which is completely contrary to Jews’ vows of “never again” after the Holocaust.                
                

            
                Two obligations of any nation and its government are to maintain the security of its people and the sovereignty of its borders. This is all Israel is asking for Obama to accept—not with rhetoric but with the realistic understanding that America should not ask Israel to endanger itself as America should not be endangered.                
                

            
                In the Haggadah, the prayer book used for the Passover Seder, Jews ask: “May we be spared sorrow and adversity, and may we never suffer shame or humiliation.”                
                

            
                In 2008, 78 percent of American Jews voted for Obama. Perhaps one lesson of this Passover should be “never again” to that.

"We’re In Denial, America, About Our President","The greatest gift of my training in psychiatry has been the ability my mentors nurtured in me to really listen to what people say. This is harder than it sounds.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It took me years to overcome the natural tendency to gloss over the very important things people say—the ones that might trigger anxiety or sadness or anger if focused upon clearly or at length.                
                

            
                 This avoidance of hearing messages that people convey is a very human reaction when what they are saying is almost too big to take to heart.                 
                

            
                The same dynamic explains why people fail to recognize predators even in the face of much data that they are unsafe, why they fail to hear the desperation in the words of a loved one who later goes on to commit suicide, why they fail to internalize expressions of genuine (and boundless) love from another person and why they fail to follow-up with questions about true revelations another offers about his or her deepest feelings and most powerful experiences.                
                

            
                It is as if the mind and soul are fitted with shock absorbers triggered only by the biggest bumps in the road—a kind of onboard, on call denial—so that special focus is required to register them.                
                

            
                I believe this internal shock absorber has prevented many Americans from really listening to the most significant messages President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have delivered.                 
                

            
                One of these messages is that the Obamas are profoundly ambivalent about whether America and Americans have historically been a force for good or ill in the world. This is why the president has repeatedly apologized for America’s behavior, in a way that not only signals other nations that our leader is at best uncertain about our moral character, but may plant self-doubt about our decency in own population.                 
                

            
                It is why the first lady honestly stated during the campaign that ""for the first time in my adult lifetime"" she was proud of her country.                 
                

            
                It is why the president would remain in a church where the pastor has been quoted as saying, “God damn, America!” and would bring his children to that church to listen and learn.                
                

            
                These are not accidental facts. They are not meaningless. They encourage denial because they are so stark and so massive in scope that they make us not want to grapple with the inevitable conclusion that our country is being led by someone who isn’t so certain he likes his countrymen.                
                

            
                Another significant message from the president is that he is sincerely suspicious of businesses—large or small—unless those businesses are controlled by the government in a way that approximates government ownership of them.                 
                

            
                This is what is meant by stating plainly that redistributing wealth is good, by teaching businesses to come to the trough to drink up bailout monies, by seeking oversight over which executives companies hire and how much they are paid and by burdening businesses with social agendas like “health care reform” and other red tape that can bring them to their knees.                
                

            
                Again, these are not accidental facts, nor meaningless. We can screen out the huge impact and import of them because they are almost unthinkable—constituting, as they do, this reality: Our commander-in-chief isn’t so sure he likes us, or our way of life. In fact, it certainly sounds, if you listen, to him, that he does not.                
                

            
                Americans are behaving a lot like the children I treat who grew up in homes in which their parents did not love them. They deny it. They do everything they can to believe, otherwise including wondering whether they themselves are to blame.                
                

            
                If we were deprived of denial, if we were willing to really listen and really be shocked, if we were willing to be wrong and wronged, we would have to admit that we elected a man to lead our country who just doesn’t express much love for it—or us.

We the People Are Obama's 'Special Interests',"We need to get special interests out of politics. They spoil everything.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                For once President Barack Obama is right: special interests are messing up health care reform. ""Every time we are in sight of health insurance reform, the special interests fight back with everything they've got,"" Obama told us.                
                

            
                You've seen that quote --or read something like it.  Obama's made some form of that claim on ABC, CBS and NBC at least a dozen times since he took office. Journalists have taken their lead from the president and restated it another 11 times. MSNBC has repeated the same claim. So has CNN, as recently as Aug. 23. The top five newspapers have done the same thing literally hundreds of times since Obama took office.                
                

            
                And it's all acting. Considering how much TV time this quote has had, Obama ought to be up for an Emmy. Yes, special interests are at play in the health care debate. But most of them --from lawyers to unions to the companies Obama bullied in to compromise --are now all on his side.                
                

            
                He is Don Quixote and the windmills fly his banner. But he's still out there whining about those evil special interests --and the pro-Obama mainstream media repeat the claims like so many public relations flacks. What's more amazing is that Obama consciously pursued each group for individual deals, made the deals and then acted upset when conservatives still mustered opposition.                
                

            
                The term ""special interests"" became political cover for Obama so he could rationalize the fact that millions of Americans still opposed his health care agenda. It was just one of many code words like ""AstroTurf"" and ""hate"" that the left use to try to undermine opponents.                
                

            
                CNN tried to delve into the ""special interests"" during its Aug. 23 special called ""Extreme Challenges: Health Care"" where anchor Anderson Cooper led a biased panel of experts to analyze the ""vital"" issue of health care. Of course the panel included CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Obama's first nominee for surgeon general and a man who backs an obesity tax. Two others, David Gergen and BET's Pamela Gentry, worked in the Clinton White House, though Gergen also worked for Reagan.                
                

            
                But the panel managed to touch on the big issue. Most of the groups that are involved in health care reform have already made deals to work with Obama. Take a look at SOME major players:                
                

            
                - The pharmaceutical industry --They fought ClintonCare in 1993. Today, they've got a deal with Dr. O where they claim to cut $80 billion in projected costs and, in return, they commit $150 million to advertise for health care reform. They get a guaranteed hike in their customer base and government won't quibble about drug costs. They aren't just on the Obama team, they've been co-opted into the starting line-up.                
                

            
                - Lawyers --There is no group safer from health care reform than lawyers --except maybe congressmen themselves. There will be no tort reform as part of health care reform. Even Gupta admitted that ""defensive medicine"" might add as much as ""up to 15 percent of health care costs."" But Democrats owe much to lawyers and that settles that.                
                

            
                -  Big business --They are actually working with Obama, hoping to offload their costs onto taxpayers.                
                

            
                The one lone ""special interest"" group that isn't totally on Obama's side is insurance companies. Even then, Aetna CEO Ron Williams has been very supportive of the president. He even appeared on ABC's trumped up health care panel with the president. So when Obama criticized opponents as trying to stop reform, he was calling out just a few insurance companies as ""funding in opposition,"" according to The New York Times.                
                

            
                Those insurance companies are battling the public option but not Obama's idea of reform. Even that little bit of opposition is already getting them bullied by Congress. FOX News reported that House Democrats"" sent 52 letters to health insurers requesting financial records for a House committee's investigation."" That Rep. Henry Waxman-led salary witch hunt is a direct response from Congress to the one group that dare oppose Obama at all.                
                

            
                It's become standard operating procedure for team Obama. Identify anyone who dares oppose the White House and then target them for attack by left-wing groups, the media and Congress. The difference here is that Obama thought he had bought off or intimidated all of his opposition. Health care reform should have had clear sailing.                
                

            
                When that proved wrong, he and his allies were especially aggressive trying to bash their remaining opponents. In the process, the interests that are being served belong to anyone who does exactly what Obama wants. And the ""special interests"" of the public that wants government out of health care just don't matter.                
                

            
                Isn't that special?

"Yes, there is a Republican war on women voters","While it’s true that President Obama’s re-election campaign is gearing up a major push this week to win over female voters, the fact is that Republicans have been helping him out on this front for weeks.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                From the GOP primary to the conservative airwaves, in state legislatures and in Congress, Republicans are playing politics with women’s health and basic liberties, driving a wedge among conservatives and driving women voters toward the Democrats.                 
                

            
                It all started with Eve. Adam, whom I suspect was a Republican, was angry that after Eve got his rib, she wanted to vote and get a job and be fairly paid. That ungrateful woman! Adam argued back and then Eve registered as an independent, and eventually became a swing vote soccer mom. But anyway…                 
                

            
                Fast-forward to February 2011 when anti-choice Republicans pushed a rogue measure to cut off all federal funding from Planned Parenthood, even though less than 3% of services provided by Planned Parenthood are abortions, none of which are paid for using federal grant dollars.                 
                

            
                Still, Republicans saw an opportunity to fire up their fringe base while undermining a liberal-leaning advocacy organization. And if the five million American women who get affordable health care from Planned Parenthood every year had to be thrown under the bus, so be it. All’s fair in politics.                 
                

            
                Almost a year later, a Republican operative at the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation pushed for the organization to cut its support of Planned Parenthood. Uproar from women was swift and strong, prompting Komen to reverse the decision and fire the ideologically-driven instigator.                 
                

            
                But Republicans kept pushing their anti-choice, anti-women’s health agenda.                 
                

            
                Presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who has repeatedly reiterated his staunch opposition to contraception, began surging in the polls among conservative voters.                 
                

            
                Republicans in Virginia proposed a law that would require women seeking abortions, even those resulting from rape or incest, to first submit to mandatory trans-vaginal ultrasounds -- a further invasion of their bodies.                 
                

            
                And Republicans in Texas pushed through a law defunding Planned Parenthood clinics in the state, cutting off at least 60,000 low-income women from their health care providers.                 
                

            
                Thursday, the New York Times reports, ""Senate Democratic women plan to march to the Senate floor to demand quick action on the extension of the Violence Against Women Act."" The Times goes on to say that the act, ""once [a piece of ] broadly bipartisan legislation...now faces fierce opposition from conservatives."" The article also mentions this point from a female, Republican Senator: ""At a closed-door Senate Republican lunch on Tuesday, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sternly warned her colleagues that the party was at risk of being successfully painted as anti-woman — with potentially grievous political consequences in the fall.""                
                

            
                Which is all to say that when President Obama’s Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius issued preliminary statements on how the contraception mandate would be applied to religiously-based institutions like hospitals and universities with a primarily public purpose, the Republican Party pounced on the situation with the hopes of exploiting it for political gain.                 
                

            
                Never mind that 28 states had already instituted similar regulations with no fanfare or uproar from religious conservatives. This was different.                 
                

            
                Republican strategists saw this as a slam dunk opportunity to criticize health care reform and paint President Obama as opposing religious liberty. If basic contraception access for women was the casualty, who cares? In fact, for some Republican politicians, like Rick Santorum, that was an added bonus!                 
                

            
                Whether or not you think this amounts to a Republican “war on women,” it’s definitely a “war on women voters.”                 
                

            
                Consider Mary Russell, a retired teacher from Iowa City, Iowa, who describes herself as an evangelical Christian and “old school” Republican of the moderate mold. Regarding the Republican presidential candidates, Ms. Russell says, “If they’re going to decide on women’s reproductive issues, I’m not going to vote for any of them. Women’s reproduction is our own business.” Now she reports she may vote for President Obama.                 
                

            
                In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll while in an imagined face-to-face match up, President Obama currently trails Mitt Romney by six percentage points with male voters,but the president has an 18 point lead with women --- across political parties.                 
                

            
                It’s no wonder. As divisive as abortion rights still are as a political issue, women voters (and most men) are overwhelmingly supportive of basic contraception. That's no surprise considering that 99% of reproductive-age women have used birth control.                 
                

            
                While women voters might rather focus on jobs and the economy, watching Republicans jeopardize women’s health and reproductive freedom while slandering those who try and stand in their way is enough to make women demand not only good jobs and fair pay but political leaders who respect the liberty and rights of women in America.                 
                

            
                President Obama’s campaign may be paying for fliers and advertisements to attract women voters, but in this regard, Republicans are giving him the kind of help that money can’t buy.

Waiting for Obama's Hail Mary,"President Obama's speech last night was hailed as a potential game changer. And it was a Hail Mary pass down the middle of the country-- but with precious little time left on the clock to deliver the kind of reforms the president says he really wants.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Eloquent, centrist, and more detailed on specifics than he has been up to this point, the president delivered the kind of speech he should have given back in May or June. Instead, he let Congress fritter months away passing partisan bills in the House and Senate to meet an August deadline that he imposed and that led to support for reform plummeting as details emerged.                
                

            
                One laugh line from his speech summed up his predicament: ""some details"" have yet to be worked out -- and these are critical. The Congressional Budget Office has said that none of the Democrats' bills (to date) in the House or the Senate, bend the curve of government health care spending. A national health care exchange, heavily regulated, would drive up the cost of coverage, not make it more affordable. Deficits would rise, not fall, under these bills.                
                

            
                Expectations for last night's speech were too high to satisfy. Would he save the ""public option,"" a rallying cry for liberals, or dismiss it, because it infuriates moderates and conservatives? He did neither. Talk of principles predominated, and the president said that as long as they were met the public option was a means to an end, not an end in itself. Killing it entirely would've infuriated liberals, but stupefied Republicans, who've spent so much time fighting it. Without a line in the sand, the public option will continue to be a flashpoint in the debate.                
                

            
                President Obama conceded that tort reform was a good idea, but in the form of a few demonstration projects run by the Department of Health and Human Services. Demonstration projects are where good ideas go to die. Republicans won't see this as a concession but as a ploy.                
                

            
                The genius of the president's 2008 campaign was that he wrapped his proposals in the conservative themes of choice and competition sprinkled with liberal aspirations of universal coverage. He was long on rhetoric and short on details. But with the economy souring, and Republicans floundering, his cool competence and steady message won the day.                
                

            
                Much of the same was on display last night: Everyone with private insurance would get to keep the coverage they have, except that it would be cheaper and better. Government would balance its budget by taming entitlement spending for Medicare and Medicaid-- primarily by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. Insurers took a beating for excluding Americans with preexisting conditions. The uninsured would be given affordable health care options, and no one would ever have to worry about health care ever again.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Everything would be the same, only better ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ the president's persistent message. But the political landscape has changed, even if the president's tactics haven't.                
                

            
                Congress has helped squander the president's political capital with a nearly $800 billion stimulus bill that has garnered widespread contempt, an unpopular bailout of the automobile industry and lavish spending in general. While the administration moves on to its next big idea (health care reform), the economy remains fragile and unemployment stands at just under ten percent. Add to this volatile mix the fact that the administration has just announced deficit projections $2 trillion higher than its own previous estimate and the public has little appetite for sweeping new programs.                
                

            
                What to do now? The president needs to do more than signal he's open to new ideas. He needs to embrace them: Pull the plug on the public option. It's on life support anyway, and it deserves to go. Put tort reform provisions with teeth into any final bill; the only group that hasn't been asked to sacrifice anything so far is the plaintiff's bar. A good place to start would be expert health courts to hear medical malpractice claims. Scrap proposals for new taxes on insurers, drug companies, and diagnostic makers. Taxes only get passed along to customers, driving up health care prices, not lowering them. Scrap the ""deficit neutral"" argument. The aim should be to lower government spending, not increase it.                
                

            
                Bring Republican leadership in the House and Senate into the discussion and invite specific proposals on areas of agreement-- like covering Americans with preexisting conditions and ensuring that competition and choice drive health care costs down. The current strategy-- picking off a Republican Senator here or there and calling it bipartisanship-- doesn't build credibility with anyone.                
                

            
                ""Misinformation"" isn't the main reason why health care reform is floundering-- and the president's speech last night won't change that. But there's still time for a game changer-- if the president changes how he plays the game.

Democrats' Health Care Sleight of Hand,"As a former (recovering) professional magician, I've seen and perpetrated my share of sleight-of-hand. But I have never seen anything quite like the linguistic and budgetary legerdemain Democrats have performed to make President Obama's health-care plan appear ""affordable.""

Congressional Democrats have been forced into such chicanery because of the price goal the president set for his reform, which, he claimed in September, ""will cost around $900 billion over 10 years"" -- less than we have spent on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. This $900 billion target is seemingly arbitrary, but is psychologically important ­- the president must know that the trillion dollar mark would be a deal breaker for many citizens and lawmakers. (Retail goods are labeled ""only"" $9.99 instead of $10 for the same reason.)

Congressional Democrats have bent over backwards, sometimes painfully, to accommodate the president's target price. For example, the $848 billion price tag that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid claims for his new health care overhaul package is a mirage, produced by ""assuming unrealistic tax increases and Medicare cuts that members of Congress will not be willing to follow through on,"" as spoiler-sport Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) points out.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This sort of trickery has been going on all year long. On October 29, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi crowed that her new health-care reform bill ""meets President Obama's call to keep the costs under $900 billion over 10 years."" -- The claim was pure misdirection, a wild gesticulation to distract from the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that the gross total cost of the bill is $1.05 trillion over ten years. But don't look there!

And even that astronomical $1.05 trillion figure is only arrived at because Pelosi's bill backloads the spending in the 2010 to 2019 timeframe -­ in fact, the vast majority of the spending in that period would not kick in until after 2013!  That's three years of little or no spending to artificially bring down your cost. Ta dah!

Or how about Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's attempt to palm off a key component of health care reform, the halt in payment cuts to Medicare physicians known as the ""doc fix"" as a separate, stand alone, $247 billion bill, financed entirely with deficit spending. Fortunately, this trick was so bad that the audience cried ""I can see that in your other hand!"" and the doc fix died a well-deserved bipartisan death.

Old magician's joke: A bunny is placed on a pedestal and covered with a screen. The magician promises to change the bunny into a completely different animal. A wave of the hand, and voila! the screen is lifted to reveals the same bunny. The magician claims it is a new animal, one with magical powers. Of course, the children are never fooled. But Pelosi seems to think the American taxpayer will fall for a similar ruse. When voters got wind that the much vaunted ""public option"" is really just code for government-run health care, she brazenly renamed it at a Florida senior's center -- and voila! -- the ""competitive option"" lives! Or is it the ""consumer option""? Either way, don't mind those ears, kids, it's an entirely new beast, with the magical powers to increase coverage, reduce cost, and bring down the deficit. Abracadabra!

There's only one thing worse than a bad magic show, and that's bad legislation. Barack Obama,  Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi have given us both at once, which, when you think about it, is some hat trick.

Exposing the world's great lie about ObamaCare and socialized medicine,"Now Playing                            Health care overhaul becomes reality                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                In health care, 2013 was a year of great irony. In the United States, the Obama administration bullheadedly forged ahead in advancing the most controversial and expensive law in recent memory, the deceptively named Affordable Care Act.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The law, opposed by a clear and consistent majority of citizens, immediately caused millions of Americans to lose their health insurance along with their choice of doctor and hospital, and millions more to pay far higher insurance premiums.                
                

            
                While the focus has been on the embarrassing roll-out that, at a minimum, demonstrated both the incompetence and the poor judgment of this administration, the true harm of this law is still to come as new government authority over U.S. health care dramatically increases.                
                

            
                Concurrently, Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), the paradigm of government-controlled health care, turned 65 years old in 2013 and officially entered senior citizenship.                
                

            
                The NHS received its review by the British press this past year on an almost daily basis.

                Headlines blared across the UK, endlessly documenting scandalous patient care, shameful waiting lists, catastrophic hospital practices, and financial debacle.                
                

            
                Directly undermining those who advocate for an even stronger role for government in U.S. health care, the British press has instead been documenting the disgraceful state of the NHS.                
                

            
                Despite what Americans are led to believe about nationalized health systems, including the claims that everyone is insured and care is free under such systems, the facts about what’s really important in health care --- actual medical care access and quality -- showed the harmful impact of government control on health care.                
                

            
                One critical distinction generally lost amid the naïve but passionate backers of nationalized insurance is the difference between being insured and having access to care.                
                

            
                Despite the chest-thumping that everyone is insured, U.K. citizens relying on the NHS experience unconscionable problems with access to care, problems not even remotely found in the U.S.                
                

            
                How poor is access to care in socialized systems like the NHS? Access problems are so widespread that the government was compelled to issue England’s 2010 “NHS Constitution” in which it was declared that no patient should wait beyond 18 weeks for treatment.                
                

            
                It is noteworthy enough that the UK government felt so much pressure from the systemic failures of its NHS that they were forced to issue “rights” to patients about receiving medical care.                
                

            
                But should it not bring chills that the government of free people, in the 21st century, had the authority to define those rights about seeking and receiving personal medical care? And even more Kafkaesque is the government’s boldness to define lengthy target times and then to claim that standards have been met. Indeed, designed to propagate the illusion of meeting quality standards, the government decreed that targets were met, even if patients waited a full four months after the diagnosis was made for treatment to begin.                
                

            
                What is the current status of access to care, now that the rights of NHS patients to medical care were enumerated?                
                

            
                At the end of June, the number of people waiting in England to start NHS treatment was 240,000 higher than the same time last year.                
                

            
                NHS England figures for July showed that 508,555 people in London alone were waiting for operations or other treatment to begin — the highest total for at least five years.                
                

            
                Almost 60,000 more patients were waiting for treatment at the capital’s 34 NHS hospitals than one year ago. According to NHS data released in August, hospital waiting lists soared to a five-year high, with almost 2.9 million patients with a known diagnosis in the queue for treatment.                
                

            
                In Wales, the number of patients waiting more than nine months for hospital treatment in November had more than doubled in six months. The Welsh government also reported their NHS is still failing to treat 8 to 13% of the most urgent cancer cases within 62 days – two full months after diagnosis.                
                

            
                Even given a laughably long leash of an 18 week standard, the number of patients not being treated within the target of 18 weeks soared to 39,145 — up 16 per cent on the previous month -- in London alone.                
                

            
                The BBC discovered even more scandalous news back in February --  many patients initially assessed as needing surgery were subsequently re-categorized by the hospital so that they could be removed from waiting lists to distort the already unconscionable delays.                
                

            
                Royal College of Surgeons President Norman Williams, calling this “outrageous,” publicly charged that hospitals are cutting their waiting lists by artificially raising thresholds.                
                

            
                Though long proven by facts documented by the UK government and in scientific journals, these shocking waits for care, whether for specialist appointments, heart surgery, stroke treatment, diagnostic scans, or cancer care go virtually unreported by the U.S. media.                
                

            
                Ironically, U.S. media outrage was widespread when time to appointment for Americans averaged 20.5 days for five specialties in 2009. Escaping American media coverage was that those requests were for healthy check-ups in almost all cases, by definition the lowest medical priority.                
                

            
                It remains unreported that the U.S. wait for routine check-ups was significantly less than for sick Brits needing heart surgery (57 days), or Canadians with “probable cancer” of the gastrointestinal tract (26 days) or proven GI bleeding (71 days).                
                

            
                Even for purely elective routine physicals, U.S. waits are shorter than for seriously ill patients in countries with nationalized insurance.                
                

            
                The disgrace of nationalized insurance systems extends far beyond limited access to care.                
                

            
                Comparing data for cancer, heart disease, and stroke, the most common sources of serious illness and death in the U.S. and Europe, and the diseases that generate the highest medical expenditures, we see the overt failure of the NHS and its socialist relatives compared to the U.S. And the same bottom line is true for the most important chronic diseases that portend long term morbidity and mortality, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.                
                

            
                All have better access to care and better treatment results in the U.S. than in the U.K., proven by studies in the world’s leading medical journals.                
                

            
                Adding to those undeniable facts is a long list of inexcusable scandals in NHS hospitals that were repeatedly discovered, investigated, and catalogued with promises of change this past year.                  
                

            
                These outrages were epitomized in 2013 by the Staffordshire Trust debacle, where between 400 and 1,200 neglected and abused patients died in squalid and degrading circumstances, where patients were left so thirsty that drinking from the pots of watered plants was necessary.                
                

            
                Although unreported here in the U.S., the 2013 Francis report about Staffordshire NHS hospital, containing more than one million pages and 64,000 documents, and costing British taxpayers about $20 million, caused outrage even for those wedded to government-controlled health care.                
                

            
                While forcing the resignation of the NHS chief, the report more importantly officially called out the insidious negative culture in the NHS, involving a tolerance of unacceptably poor standards and patient neglect , a preoccupation with cost-cutting, targets and processes while losing sight of its fundamental responsibility to provide safe patient care.                
                

            
                Yet, the greatest deception of all about NHS-style socialized medicine, the silly canard that it provides “free” health care for everyone, was visible for anyone interested in facts in 2013.                
                

            
                The cost to British patients and taxpayers for their dismally performing NHS has been enormous and has increased by 94 per cent in real terms between 1999-2000 and 2009-2010. And even in the face of such outrageous money-wasting as reported in September that millions of non-existent “ghost” patients were registered at NHS surgeries costing taxpayers £750 million over five years, Secretary of State for                
                

            
                Health Jeremy Hunt intransigently argued against any restraints on the 2014 NHS budget of £114 billion ($175 billion), despite its shameful performance and lack of accountability.                
                

            
                And that cost still does not prevent a growing number of British taxpayers from looking elsewhere for medical care. About six million Brits now buy private health insurance, including almost two-thirds of Brits earning more than $78,700.                
                

            
                According to The Telegraph, the number of people paying for their own private care is up 20 percent year-to-year, with about 250,000 now choosing to pay for private treatment out-of-pocket each year.                
                

            
                Isn’t it notable that more than 50,000 Britons travel out of the country per year and spend £161 million to receive medical care due to lack of access, even though they are already paying for their NHS insurance?                
                

            
                Despite all of these realities, just as in America, many in positions of power refuse to accept the facts and continue to deceive the public.                
                

            
                Even the hard-hitting 2013 Staffordshire report still insisted near the top of its list of summary points that “the NHS is a service of which the country can be justly proud, offering as it does universal access to free medical care, often of the highest order.”                  
                

            
                In a truly offensive effort to further manipulate the public about their failing system of socialized medicine, the NHS in London separately spent even more taxpayer money -- almost £13 million, or about $20 million -- on public relations in the last three years, as reported by the BBC.                
                

            
                Eerily echoing that disgraceful waste of hard-earned taxpayer money, our own Obama administration will spend about $684 million, as cited by the Associated Press, mainly on a massive campaign to convince young people to sign up for ObamaCare exchanges and purchase unnecessarily bloated, highly expensive insurance they don’t need or want.                
                

            
                Finally, the system often heralded as the model for US health care reform, offers access and quality of care so poor that Britain is now experiencing a serious brain drain of their young doctors.                
                

            
                The NHS has become hugely reliant on doctors trained outside the UK. An estimated 94,833 of the 259,719 doctors of all doctors registered with the General Medical Council, 36.5% of the total, are from foreign medical schools. And what is the solution to the disastrous waiting lists and disgraceful care in the NHS in the face of a considerable outflow of UK medical professionals?                
                

            
                The U.K. government is now considering sub-contracting operations to private firms from other countries.                
                

            
                Is anyone in the U.S. government watching this socialized medicine debacle unfold?                
                

            
                Yet, the stubborn pursuit of an overtly failed system like the NHS, where government controls medical care, is the model for ObamaCare, so the inexorable progression towards what we see in the U.K. should be in the minds of American voters as more components of the law unfold in 2014.                
                

            
                Ultimately, the only way out is for taxpayers and all U.S. citizens who care about choice, access, and quality of health care to make their voices heard.                
                

            
                Thankfully, another election is approaching.

                Massachusetts, the bluest of states in our union, stunned the nation on Tuesday when it voted to end Washington’s unbridled spending and plan for government-run health care. Seventy-eight percent of Republican Scott Brown’s voters strongly oppose the current health care legislation. Sixty-one percent of Brown’s voters said deficit reduction was more important to them than health care.

Americans still want health care reform, but they are looking for clear, patient-centered, fiscally responsible solutions. Physicians for Reform offers such a plan. Here are five reforms we propose.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                REFORM #1: Sell Insurance Across State Lines

FACT: State mandates drive up costs

• Health insurance for a 25-year-old male in New Jersey costs nearly six times what it does in Kentucky, largely because of state mandates.

• Introducing choice and competition reduces business overhead. Businesses could use these savings to raise wages or hire workers. This stimulates the economy without spending a dime of federal money.

FACT: Interstate competition optimizes legislative oversight

• Competing incentives push states toward quality and efficiency. Increased regulation protects patients. Decreased regulation attracts business. If fifty state legislatures compete to balance patient protection against affordability, effective and efficient oversight will emerge.

• The alternative is to have federal mandates—giving Americans no choice and leaving the political class with no competition.

We the People provide oversight

• Independent watchdog groups could rate states and insurance companies on cost and patient satisfaction. This sifts the good from the bad.

• Armed with knowledge and incentive, Americans would push insurers to offer better, cheaper products tailored to their specific needs.

CONCLUSION: Allowing businesses to purchase insurance across state lines empowers We the People, not Washington, and does not cost a dime. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer repeatedly questioned President Obama’s senior adviser David Axelrod about this reform. Axelrod offered no reason why it would not work. This measure should enjoy bipartisan support.

REFORM #2: Let individuals purchase health insurance with pre-tax dollars

FACT: Insurance companies serve businesses, not patients

• Businesses purchase employee health insurance with pre-tax dollars. Individuals purchase insurance with post-tax dollars making their insurance far more expensive.

• This reform lets patients buy products that meet their needs and makes insurers more accountable to patients.

CONCLUSION: This reform empowers We the People and requires no federal spending.

REFORM #3: Encourage Health Care Savings Accounts (HSAs)

FACT: HSAs reduce health care costs without rationing (cutting Medicare)

• No one spends someone else’s money as wisely as they spend their own. This is the fundamental problem of any third-party-payer system (whether insurance companies or government).

• When a third party pays, nobody cares about cost. HSAs encourage patients to ask:                 
                

            
                1) How much does this cost?                 
                

            
                2) Do I need this test or medication?

• HSAs let patients control their own money, decreasing health care spending by 13%.

• This “bends the curve” without rationing care. During 2005 and 2006, traditional insurance rose 7.3% annually. Lower cost / higher deductable plans combined with HSAs rose only 2.7% annually.

FACT: HSAs encourage “young invincibles” to buy insurance

• Allowing patients to transfer unused, pre-tax HSA dollars to retirement accounts gives “young invincibles” a reason to purchase health insurance.

• Washington’s “reform” forces younger / healthier Americans to buy insurance under threat of fines or prison.

CONCLUSION: By addressing a fundamental problem of today’s health care system, this reform “bends the curve” without rationing care. Again, it empowers We the People without plunging America further into debt.

REFORM #4: End abusive medical litigation

FACT: Frivolous litigation drives physicians out of medicine

• Tremendous upheaval occurs when physicians are accused of malpractice—even when acquitted. Bringing tens of millions of new patients into the system requires more physicians, not fewer.

FACT: Frivolous litigation reform lowers cost and improves access to care

• Americans spend approximately $124 billion every year because physicians practice defensive medicine. Frivolous lawsuit reform could reduce healthcare spending by approximately $70 billion annually.

• In 2002, 62% of counties in Texas did not have an obstetrician. After passing frivolous medical litigation reform in 2003, nearly 600 obstetricians returned to practice medicine in the Lone Star State by 2007.                
                

            
                CONCLUSION: Ending abusive litigation “bends the curve” without rationing care. Physicians for Reform outlines medical litigation reform that reduces frivolous suits, expedites legitimate suits, and holds negligent physicians accountable. (www.PhysiciansForReform.org)

REFORM #5: Covering the uninsured

FACT: We can insure the uninsured without expanding American debt

• Approximately 25% of patients who visit the emergency room where I work do not have health care coverage. Clearly something must be done.

• A system of tax credits can help the uninsured purchase coverage. This would cost approximately $80 billion annually. Reforms #1 through #4 will save approximately $120 billion annually, covering the uninsured. Healthcare reform must be viewed in terms of American debt, not federal deficit.

Getting Health Care Reform Right

Scott Brown's election to the Senate gives the nation a chance to slow down and rethink health care reform. It gives our lawmakers an opportunity to keep the patient at the center of American health care. And to do this we must:

- Scrap the current legislation.
- Enact the five reforms listed above.
- Pass each reform separately, one bill every four months.
- Limit each bill to 50 pages.
- Let each bill pass or fail on its own merits—no pork, no pay-offs.
- Make final language available to the public for at least 7 days prior to voting.

We the People want patient-centered, fiscally responsible reform. Change for the sake of change is not enough. Massachusetts voters made this clear. Washington, listen and give Americans real solutions. Only then will we support you at the ballot box.

Not sure, but didn’t Jefferson say: “A wise and frugal government… which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits ...""?
No. I voted for a congressman who will represent my point of view in making laws – if they won’t, then they’re gone in November.

Why Rick Perry Gives Me Hope On Health Care,"As I watched Texas Governor Rick Perry announce his presidential candidacy this weekend, he gave me a sense of hope and his speech really resonated with me.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                His words reminded me of the respect that we as Americans deserve, and the importance of a government that works for us and with us – rather than the downward spiral that the current political and economic climate has continued to indulge.                
                

            
                In his speech on Saturday, Perry pledged to free Americans from ""the grips of central planners who would control our health care, who would spend our treasure, who downgrade our future and micromanage our lives."" And I’d like to think that he would keep his word.                
                

            
                He has successfully led Texas for more than 10 years through one of the hardest economic downturns in American history.                
                

            
                Now, being a practicing physician, naturally, health care reform is high on my radar. Over the past few years, I have commented extensively on the topic and the overall challenges that the practice of medicine is facing these days. So I decided to take a closer look at the state of medicine in Texas.                
                

            
                I was surprised to find that Texas is considered by many doctors, nurses and health care professionals in general, to be among the best states in the country to practice medicine.                 
                

            
                Several surveys have found that there are many benefits to practicing medicine in the state of Texas including a variety of top-quality medical centers, affordable housing for medical professionals and their families, no state income tax, and finally, a well-balanced liability reform which protects both patients and doctors, without the looming threat of frivolous law suits.                
                

            
                I have to say, that my first impression of Gov. Perry, as the successful leader of the second largest state in the union has piqued my interest in seeing what he would be capable of achieving for our country.                
                

            
                I’ve been practicing medicine for more than 30 years, and I love what I do.That's why it's so important to me that we protect the institution of American medicine that was built on the same principles woven into the very fabric of this great country.                
                

            
                So this is my personal opinion, as a father of three and a proud American, but also, as a doctor who wants to continue to improve the quality of medical care without worrying about the bureaucrats looking over my shoulder in the future.

"Who Do You Think We Are, Mr. President? Subjects or Citizens?","Put aside all the serious fights over the climate science, the astronomical costs associated with capping carbon emissions, the endless demands for carbon reparations, compliance and verification, etc., the only question that really matters this week at the Copenhagen Conference on climate change is whether President Obama is really going to end up corrupting the American constitutional system in front of the entire world.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Who will President Obama heed? The American people and our constitutional system of checks and balances, or the collection of dictators, tyrants, and mostly undemocratic heads of government convened by the United Nations in Copenhagen this week? They are tempting the American president to do what he wants to do and what they mostly do: ignore the will of their own people and sign a political agreement based on an unconstitutional sham.                
                

            
                Article 2, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution is crystal clear: “He [the President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.”                
                

            
                In 1997, the U.S. Senate voted 95-0 to tell President Clinton that it was the view of the Senate that the United States should not sign any international agreement on climate change that either did not mandate all countries to limit emissions or which would otherwise result in serious harm to the U.S. economy.                
                

            
                Nevertheless, Vice President Al Gore signed an agreement a few months later that did not meet the Senate’s test. Knowing how the Senate would vote, President Clinton never even bothered to submit this Kyoto agreement to the U.S. Senate. It would have been dead on arrival and President Clinton wasn’t interested in political embarrassment.                
                

            
                Twelve years later the world has moved from Kyoto to Copenhagen but the same dynamics apply. Instead of having taken a formal vote, the U.S. Senate has stalled in its effort to adopt binding cap and trade carbon emission reductions along the lines that President Obama, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the delegates in Copenhagen would have the U.S. do. While not the same as a 95-0 vote, the situation in the U.S. Senate conveys the same message: no cap and trade deal is going to get out of the Senate, either as ordinary legislation or as a part of an international agreement that would require the approval of 2/3 of the Senate.                
                

            
                Just like Vice President Al Gore before him, President Obama might sign such an agreement with great fanfare and receive the accolades of fawning delegates from around the world, only to return home and be bitterly reminded that his signature, without the Senate’s approval, is meaningless.                
                

            
                Yet, today, President Obama is asserting that the constitutional principles governing Gore and Clinton in 1997 don’t apply to him in 2009.                
                

            
                How’s that?                
                

            
                It seems that our president, a Harvard law graduate and former constitutional law lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, has discovered an interpretation of our Constitution that had escaped the notice of two centuries of American citizens and lawyers and judges before him.
President Obama’s apparent view is that the Environmental Protection Agency, one of his executive branch agencies, can claim the regulatory power to impose, on its own authority, a system of taxation akin to what the Congress has so far refused to adopt. And since the executive branch can now implement what the legislative branch has failed to enact, then there is no need to get the Senate’s approval for a Copenhagen agreement.                
                

            
                This is, to say the least, a most curious interpretation of our Constitution. What’s next? Secretary Sebelius deciding that the Senate debate on health care reform has become tiresome, so she claims power for the HHS to reorder the healthcare economy on her own authority?                
                

            
                The unilateral assertion of power by the Executive Branch in advance of the Copenhagen Conference caused at least one U.S. Senator from the president’s own party, Jim Webb of Virginia, to write a fairly pointed letter to the President reminding him of the provisions of the Constitution that apply to the powers of the Legislative Branch:                
                

            
                Dear Mr. President:                
                

            
                I would like to express my concern regarding reports that the Administration may believe it has the unilateral power to commit the government of the United States to certain standards that may be agreed upon at the upcoming United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties 15 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The phrase “politically binding” has been used.                
                

            
                Although details have not been made available, recent statements by Special Envoy on Climate Change Todd Stern indicate that negotiators may be intending to commit the United States to a nationwide emission reduction program. As you well know from your time in the Senate, only specific legislation agreed upon in the Congress, or a treaty ratified by the Senate, could actually create such a commitment on behalf of our country.                
                

            
                I would very much appreciate having this matter clarified in advance of the Copenhagen meetings.
Sincerely,
Jim Webb
United States Senator                
                

            
                Webb’s letter to the president is cordial Senate-speak for “Are you kidding me?”                
                

            
                Considering that the president’s February 2009 budget allocated $645 billion for a cap-and-trade system to accomplish its emissions reduction goals, it suggests that the president believes his executive branch has the power to bypass the legislative branch and impose taxes of at least $645 billion on its own authority.                
                

            
                That’s called ""taxation without representation"" and the last person who imposed such a system on Americans was named King George III. The first hint King George III got that American colonists weren’t quite happy with his program to impose taxes on tea without their consent was that a small band of our forefathers dressed up like Indians and dumped a bunch of the King’s tea into Boston Harbor in 1773. Two years later we were at war with the British tyrant and didn’t stop fighting for seven years until we defeated his armies on the battlefield.                
                

            
                Now the president wants to assert his newly claimed power to taxation without representation in Copenhagen to make a climate deal with the mostly undemocratic regimes that the United Nations typically brings together.                
                

            
                Who does President Obama think we are? Citizens or subjects?

ABC = All Barack Channel?,"Conservatives are outraged about the special access given to ABC News to broadcast a series of programs from the White House on Wednesday. ABC is scheduled to broadcast ""Good Morning America"" from the White House lawn, ""World News"" its nightly news show from the Blue Room and a special prime time ""Questions for the President: Prescription for America"" on President Obama's health care reform proposal from the East Room.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Many fear objective and balanced coverage of the president controversial health care plan will be the casualty of ""ABC day"" at the White House. The transformation of a major news network from watchdog to Obama lapdog would threaten the very nature of an independent press that is vital in maintaining liberty and a civil society.                
                

            
                Co-opting corporations, especially media giants such as ABC News, to promote his policies appears to be part of Obama's political strategy. General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt, for example, is a member of the president's Economic Recovery Board (PERB) and the company's media units NBC News, CNBC and MSNBC frequently advance Obama's energy policy through its programming and news coverage which would also benefit GE's investment in green technologies.                
                

            
                While financial opportunism may be the driver of GE's favorable media coverage of Obama's energy policy, ABC's interest in health care may represent a deep seeded liberal bias that goes to its parent company, The Walt Disney Company.                
                

            
                Disturbingly, Disney CEO Bob Iger has shown a willingness to put his personal political views over company profits. Under his direction, Iger refuses to sell the DVD or its distribution rights of the ABC miniseries ""The Path to 9/11,"" a program that was based on the federal government's ""9/11 Commission Report."" The miniseries was criticized by liberal politicians and advocacy groups when it aired in September 2006 because they felt it made President Clinton look responsible for the terrorist attacks in 2001.                
                

            
                Despite losing about $ 40 million on the project because the left-wing generated controversy intimidated commercial sponsorship, Iger keeps the production under lock and key thus denying shareholders an opportunity to recoup their investment in the miniseries.                
                

            
                Disney can't claim the controversial nature of ""The Path to 9/11"" as a reason to not profit from the film. Disney profited from Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" -- a highly politicized view of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. According to Slate, Disney ""booked a $46 million net profit"" while ""it paid Moore a stunning $21 million"" for his documentary.                
                

            
                Because of concerns that Iger's political views are harming its investors, a mutual fund I'm affiliated with filed a shareholder proposal with Disney to increase transparency of the company's political donations.                
                

            
                At Disney's annual meeting, shareholders applauded my explanation of the political basis for the company's refusal to sell ""The Path to 9/11"" but it clearly upset Iger. When I approached Iger to shake his hand after my presentation, he rejected my offer and instead launched what some in media circles refer to as an ""F-bomb.""                
                

            
                In response to our shareholder proposal, Disney tried to save face by saying it was indeed willing to sell the distribution rights of the miniseries but I have recently learned that a new, legitimate offer to buy the miniseries was rejected by the company. Previously, inquiries from our company to Iger, and Disney's chairman about purchasing the rights of the miniseries went unanswered.                
                

            
                Iger has impeccable liberal credentials. He gives about 90 percent of his personal political contributions to Democrats and special interest groups; his wife, former news anchor Willow Bay, has a senior position with the Huffington Post.                
                

            
                Disney also has connections to Obama through PERB. Monica C. Lozano, CEO of La Opinion, a major Spanish-language newspaper in the U. S., is a member of Disney's board of directors and the president's economic board.                
                

            
                Given today's volatile political climate and the diverse array of media sources including the Internet and cable TV, Disney/ABC's liberal bias could backfire on the company. After all, a reputation for credibility and trustworthiness is a news organizations only asset.                
                

            
                Moreover, if conservatives, frustrated over Obama's assault on liberty and his coziness with ABC rally against the company, they could pressure its sponsors not to advertise on the network.                
                

            
                Plus, why would conservatives want to attend Disney theme parks and movies if their hard earned money is going to be used to support policies and politicians that are opposed to their values?                
                

            
                Why would conservatives support Disney when it promotes government run health care and Michael Moore's biased view of the 9/11 terrorist attacks while silencing ""The Path to 9/11?""                
                

            
                Choosing politics over profits is a dangerous game. If the president is using corporatism to advance his policies, public backlash against Disney and other corporate members of Team Obama may find themselves feeling the heat of an increasingly frustrated and disenfranchised public.                
                

            
                The mid-term elections are still more than a year away but Americans may choose to vote with their wallets by punishing companies that threaten their principles.

"Sex, Lies and Immigration -- The More GOP Candidates Talk, the More Out of Touch They Appear","President Obama should sleep well tonight. The more the Republican presidential candidates open their mouths at Thursday night's GOP presidential debate in Orlando, the more clear it is how out of touch they are with mainstream American voters. Tonight, there was no clear winner in the debate. The loser? Common sense and common decency. Here’s how I would sum it up:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Sex                 
                

            
                Via a YouTube video, an active member of the United States military spoke about no longer having to hide his sexual orientation thanks to the lifting of ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell."" A sizeable portion of the live audience in Orlando, Florida could be heard booing -- booing an active service member bravely defending our country!                 
                

            
                Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum responded by demeaning this honorable American, saying that gays in the military shouldn’t get “special privilege”--  failing to acknowledge that ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" was actually special punishment.                 
                

            
                More than 8 in 10 Americans supported repealing the unfair restriction on gay men and women in the military. But Santorum offensively quipped that “sex has no place in the military” -- something that would come as quite a shock to heterosexuals in the armed forces, who are free to have whatever relationships they please. It was a shameful moment when an aspiring president failed to stand up for the most basic of human rights and some in the audience booed a member of our nation’s military.                
                

            
                Lies                
                

            
                There were too many to count.                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Romney, the president did not go on an “apology tour.”                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Perry, we do not have the highest corporate tax rate in the world -- in fact, we have one of the lowest.                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Johnson, our nation is not bankrupt .                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Cain, the health care reform law would in no way, shape or form ration your cancer care .                
                

            
                It’s one thing to make grand rhetorical statements to try and get attention in a crowded race. It’s another thing to flat out lie to the American people.

Immigrants                
                

            
                I love it when the Republican presidential candidates quote Ronald Reagan. After all, as conservative Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) recently put it, given the extremist influence of the Tea Party today, “Ronald Reagan would have a hard time getting elected as a Republican”.                 
                

            
                Reagan raised taxes 11 times, supported unions, bailed out Social Security -- and granted amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants.                 
                

            
                Perry, who like his doppelganger Bush is actually fairly pragmatic and humane when it comes to undocumented immigrants, was attacked for allowing kids who grew up their whole life in Texas to pay in-state tuition rates for state universities.

But during the immigrant bashing round of Thursday night's debate in Orlando (and for those of you thinking, “No, we’re just against illegal immigrants -- note the commercial that ran during one of the breaks, a conservative group advocating for a reduction in legal immigration to the United States), several candidates piled on suggesting that immigrants only come to America for the benefits -- not, er, jobs to feed their families -- and that we should stop giving immigrants even the most basic of benefits.                 
                

            
                I was waiting for another “let them die” moment, suggesting we should even deny undocumented immigrants emergency access to hospital emergency rooms.                 
                

            
                When Perry, the man who has executed 234 mostly guilty individuals, chirps up and accuses his compatriots of “not having a heart”, we should all take pause.                
                

            
                The good news is that the vast majority of Americans support the right of gay men and women to serve openly in the military and the vast majority of Americans support a path to citizenship for our nation’s undocumented immigrants.                 
                

            
                Hopefully the vast majority of Americans can see through the candidates’ lies as well.                 
                

            
                But unfortunately for our nation and our future, the leading candidates of a major political party are firmly out of touch with the majority of American people and reality.

              In the first six months of this administration, President Donald Trump has fought every day to deliver on his promises to the American people. At a historic pace, this president has taken bold action to restore prosperity, keep Americans safe and secure, and hold government accountable.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump has signed more than 40 bills and nearly 40 executive orders on everything from health care to energy, infrastructure and more.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While the previous administration turned to federal agencies to enact its agenda, President Trump has signed more laws to slash through federal red tape than any president in American history and has saved businesses up to $18 billion a year in costs.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              And whereas the last administration stifled the use of America’s vast energy resources, President Trump has put a renewed emphasis on American energy – approving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, rolling back the Clean Power Plan, and putting America First by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump inherited an economy that would barely budge – but under his watch, American businesses small and large have already created more than 800,000 new jobs since January. Company after company is responding to the president’s agenda with optimism – investing billions of dollars in American jobs, American workers and America’s future.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As the father of a United States Marine, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of the armed forces of the United States of America. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              After years of so-called “sequestration” and budget cuts to our armed forces, President Trump has already signed the largest increase in defense spending in nearly 10 years and called for the greatest investment in military readiness since the days of President Ronald Reagan.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every single day to restore an America of freedom, prosperity and opportunity for all.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              And this president calls our enemy by its name – radical Islamic terrorism – and with the leadership of this commander-in-chief our armed forces are taking the fight to ISIS on our terms on their soil. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              When it comes to security here in the homeland, President Trump has taken decisive steps to secure our borders and enforce our laws – a direct contrast with the previous administration.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And while illegal immigration was rampant in recent years, our administration has been working with local law enforcement to take drug dealers, members of gangs like MS-13, and other violent criminals off our streets. Illegal crossings at our southern border are down by more than 60 percent since the start of this year. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              After the previous president tried to stack the courts with liberal jurists, our president made a commitment to appoint federal judges who will uphold the Constitution and the God-given liberties enshrined there. Look no further than the newest Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch.

              President Trump’s accomplishments are nothing short of historic. But as the president likes to say, at this White House that's just what we call a good start.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump will not rest and he will not relent until we keep our promise to the American people and repeal and replace ObamaCare.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump has called on the Congress to do its job, and we will continue to work with both the House and Senate to give the American people health care reform built on the principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition and state-based reforms.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump is firmly committed to passing the largest tax cut since the days of President Reagan. We’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We’ll simplify the tax code. We’ll eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We’ll make the code flatter and fairer for everyone. And under President Trump, we will repeal death taxes once and for all. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And to get this economy moving again, we’re going to cut business taxes in America so that companies in this country can compete with companies around the world and create good jobs right here in America. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We’ll end the broken system that penalizes companies for calling America home. And we’ll cut taxes on trillions of dollars that are locked away overseas so that American businesses can invest in America’s future.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every single day to restore an America of freedom, prosperity and opportunity for all.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So with boundless faith in the American people, with faith in President Trump’s vision and determination, and with faith in God who has ever watched over this Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, I say with confidence: We will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again.

                So. The Democrats are in freefall. Their ""landmark"" legislation -- ObamaCare, rammed through without a single Republican vote -- is in collapse. The president has been exposed as a liar (see: ""If you like your health plan, you can keep it. Period."").

                In other words, the Democrats are on the run, vulnerable, weak, and poised for a major defeat.

                So what are the Republicans doing? Are they going for the jugular, attacking nonstop until November and showing no mercy? (In other words, acting like Democrats...) Of course not. They're Republicans. They are stepping in to help the Dems out.                 
                

            
                Instead of pounding ObamaCare and the president and the Democrats with the facts of an atrocious stab at socialized medicine and the lies they've used to push it, the GOP appears ready to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by switching gears to the highly polarizing issue of immigration.                 
                

            
                Never mind that immigration doesn't even score more than 2 percent in polls asking what the most important issue is to the country. Rather than let this sleeping dog lie (at least through November), the Republican leadership is jumping to the assistance of the Democrats by supporting amnesty.                
                

            
                Remember this CRITICAL POINT: For Obama and the left, no issue is about the stated issue. It's ALWAYS about something bigger and more profound – namely, as Obama put it in 2008, ""the fundamental transformation of the nation.""                 
                

            
                So, for the left, health care ""reform"" was never about health care or health insurance. It was only and always about using the huge health care sector (1/6th of the U.S. economy) as a lever to transform the broader economy into a European-style socialist model. For one simple reason: if the government controls your health care, the government controls you.                
                

            
                ObamaCare was never about your health care. It was about government power and control.                
                

            
                And so it is with immigration ""reform."" For Obama and the Left, it's not about actually dealing forcefully and effectively with the immigration issue.                 
                

            
                If that were the case, the administration would be faithfully enforcing the laws we have on the books. It is not.                 
                

            
                They seek this ""reform"" for one simple reason: because immigration is the final missing piece of the ""fundamental transformation of the nation.""                 
                

            
                If they can get amnesty for 12 million (who knows what the real number is? 12 million? 18 million? 30 million?) illegals, they know they’ve got the country in a headlock. Most Hispanics are natural Democrat voters.                
                

            
                Not all, obviously. Many believe in hard work, individual liberty, economic liberty, and obeying the law.                
                

            
                But the majority vote Democrat, and the party has been working hard to lock them into government dependency.                 
                

            
                If amnesty goes through, the Democrats will flood the zone with millions of more Democrat voters, possibly flip Texas blue, and get their long-sought-after permanent Democrat voting majority.                 
                

            
                If that happens, you will never again see a Ronald Reagan or a George W. Bush. You may never again see a GOP majority in Congress. The Republicans will be relegated to permanent minority status. And a shrinking one at that.                
                

            
                This is the goal of the Democrats. Why on earth would Republicans want to help them achieve it?                
                

            
                Because they think they'll be ""rewarded"" by Hispanic voters?                 
                

            
                That didn't happen after the 1986 amnesty. In fact, the percentage of Hispanics voting GOP actually went DOWN after that amnesty.                 
                

            
                To take the issue off the table? Forget it. As soon as the path to amnesty is in place, Democrats will accelerate the process to get them voting as fast as possible, so the ""issue"" will never be off the table for Republicans.                
                

            
                Obama and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and Organizing for Action and George Soros and Eva Longoria and everyone else on the extreme left must be laughing out loud at the pure, destructive stupidity of the Republicans. They've got the Democrats on the ropes, and they're throwing them a lifeline.                
                

            
                While strangling themselves right out of existence.

Now Is Not the Time for Compromise on Health Care,"Editor's note: This is the campus perspective from our partners at UWire.com. Author Iyah Romm is a Boston University medical student.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Two years ago I had an accident-- I fell down a flight of stairs, landed on my head and as a result, am now legally blind. Why is this relevant? As a medical student, I had access to world-class care unlike most others.                
                

            
                That wasn't the case for Paul, a young man with diabetes I met shortly after my accident. He too lost his vision because-- like at least 46.3 million other Americans and 14,000 more each day-- he was uninsured and couldn't afford the insulin he so desperately needed.                
                

            
                And yet, as sad as this is to say, Paul may be relatively fortunate. A recent study in the American Journal of Public Health estimates that 45,000 Americans die each year simply because they lack health insurance.                
                

            
                We need reform. Desperately.                
                

            
                But in the two years since my accident, despite denying claims left and right, the insurance industry spent $16 million, drawn from premiums, on Congressional campaign contributions to fight health care reform legislation. This summer alone, they spent $1.4 million a day opposing reform through insidious and deceptive advertising and lobbying campaigns.                
                

            
                Insurance companies and the politicians who do their bidding, must be curtailed.                
                

            
                The potential loss of this monumental opportunity for meaningful health care reform poses a great threat to our generation.                
                

            
                But the purported goals of reform-- realizing universal access, ""bending"" the cost curve and improving quality-- have been obfuscated in Congress. And while these goals permeate President Barack Obama's rhetoric, his proposed plan lacks a robust public option truly open to all and the unapologetic regulatory framework necessary to eliminate malignant industry practices. Instead it contains individual mandates that will drive Americans into the arms of insurance companies-- which is just what they want!                
                

            
                Without real reform, premiums are projected to nearly double by 2020. I do not want to witness the 100th millionth uninsured person but I fear that the current legislation is inexorably wedded to maintaining the status quo. It would rest the future of health care on the free market that has already failed us.                
                

            
                As a national policy leader of the American Medical Student Association, I believe the best solution to our health care crisis is a unified, publicly financed, privately delivered system of guaranteed high quality health care for all. For this reason, I support Representative Anthony Weiner's (D-NY) single payer amendment.                
                

            
                At a minimum, a robust public option that is open to all and publicly financed must be incorporated into any health care reform legislation. Such a public-private hybrid is supported by 62.9 percent of physicians and 72 percent of Americans. The Commonwealth Fund estimates that this plan would save $3 trillion over 11 years. The public option currently in play in the House and the Senate will likely enroll less than five percent of Americans, and as such, will lack the power to be a major market force. ""Reform"" cannot perpetuate the status quo. Care must be more efficient and less costly. Outcomes must be improved and special interests made disinterested.                
                

            
                Every day, we see countless underinsured patients who are denied medically necessary care and who suffer preventable harm. Treatment decisions are too often driven by what's covered rather than what's necessary. The current system forces doctors to choose medications based on compensation-- not indication-- to anticipate a fight for each test or procedure, and, most disturbingly, to deny, or ""ration,"" care based on ability to pay. As doctors we learn to game the system-- but in the process, we also feed its inefficiencies and drive the ""cost curve"" in the wrong direction.                
                

            
                We did not go to medical school to spend hours pleading with claims specialists for an ultrasound for a young mother with suspicious breast lumps, or for coverage of an essential, non-formulary drug for a hardworking father with multiple sclerosis.                
                

            
                We are trained in evidence-based medicine, not insurance-based medicine. We are not driven to don our white coats to tell a college student struggling with addiction that, ""we're sorry, but your insurance only covers three days of in-patient substance abuse treatment; you have to go home now,"" knowing full well that she will likely return to substance abuse. We see patients discharged from the hospital just days after open-heart surgery, with nowhere to go, and nobody to care for them. It should not be a surprise to anyone that many such patients end up right back in the hospital.                
                

            
                And we certainly did not sign up to stand idly by, handcuffed by fragmentation, to watch people like Paul suffer unnecessary complications from preventable illnesses. Or to see people with costly conditions like another person I know, Jerome, 17, who have their coverage dumped for no apparent reason just when they need it most; Jerome has HIV.                
                

            
                Now is the time to push back. It is time for our president to uphold his promises to those who elected him, not those with deeper pockets or shriller voices. If Mr. Obama wants to be ""the last president to take on health care,"" we cannot let him compromise this opportunity away.
The current proposals would undoubtedly have some marginal effect but would not suffice. We need a fundamental shift away from this failed structure.                
                

            
                All too often we hear our hopes for progress dismissed with a glib ""can't happen."" But as students and young professionals, we can, have, and will effect profound change. Let's ensure that the first steps to comprehensive reform, a strong public option, are not sacrificed. Our voices have the power to speak louder than the industries that have failed us, but we must act together and we must act now.

Can Tim Pawlenty Beat Out Mitt Romney and Become the GOP's 2012 Nominee?,"The smart money among Washington political insiders is being stacked high in front of two nominees for the GOP presidential nomination: Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty. And at the moment the bets on Pawlenty are coming fast.
On his Comedy Central show, Jon Stewart recently described Mitt Romney as the “guy who fired everybody’s dad.” When the GOP contest comes down to a choice between these two former Republican blue state governors, Pawlenty will claim to represent the guy on the other side of that exchange – the working class voter who was fired by the Romney-type corporate raider.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It may work.                
                

            
                Pawlenty fits the bill as the fresh face in the race for establishment Republicans looking for as a nominee. He is a capable, steady and experienced politician who allows the general election to become all about President Obama and whatever anger, discontent, disappointment voters may feel about the incumbent.                
                

            
                But first Pawlenty has to win over social conservatives, Tea Party activists, and increase his name recognition among grassroots Republicans to have any chance of taking the nomination from Romney.                
                

            
                “T-Paw,” as his supporters call him, has a compelling personal story that he is sharing with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. His appeal to white, working class, middle-income Republicans is based on a simple pitch: I am one of you.                
                

            
                After his mother passed away when he was a teenager, his father worked very hard as a meat packer and then a truck driver to support Pawlenty and his four brothers and sisters. He was the first in his family to earn a college degree. Of all the GOP candidates, Pawlenty has lived a life that is closest to the experience of the average American family -- to the extent there is such a thing.                
                

            
                As Ron Brownstein recently noted in the National Journal, the white working class voting bloc is currently pessimistic and frightened about the future. There is every indication that their anxiety will influence their voting behavior. Overall, 55 percent of whites voted for Republican Sen. John McCain in the 2008 election. But President Obama won the majority of voters earning less than $50,000 a year.                
                

            
                Recent polls show white working class voters fear they are getting left behind – especially the white men who worked in construction or manufacturing -- in the nation’s post-recession economic transformation and no one in government or big business gives a damn.                
                

            
                As early as 2008 when he was on John McCain’s short list for Vice President, Pawlenty was arguing that Republicans needed to be “the party of Sam’s Club not just the country club”
While Romney’s consistency problems are well known – flip flopping on abortion, gay marriage, auto bailouts, employer mandates in health care and an a whole host of other issues – Pawlenty may be vulnerable to a similar line of attack from Democrats.
The affable 50-year-old Minnesotan supported a version of cap-and-trade – just like President Obama - to control pollution before changing his position to fit with Republican opposition. But his problems also extend to the credibility of his claim to be a champion of the working class.

Pawlenty proudly declares that he grew up in a union household. Yet, Pawlenty enthusiastically supported the efforts of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to strip public sector union workers of their collective bargaining rights earlier this year. Moreover, as Governor of Minnesota, Pawlenty supported legislation that would have limited these same basic rights for the North Star State’s public union workers.                
                

            
                Like the rest of his party, Pawlenty railed against President Obama’s stimulus package that was comprised mostly of tax cuts for middle class families – the very people he purports to be the champion of. He vehemently opposed Obama’s health care reform legislation that allows those same families to keep their children on their family’s insurance plan until they are 26 years old or can find a job.                
                

            
                Pawlenty also decried Obama’s rescue of the American auto industry as a “bailout” even though it saved the industry and created thousands of blue-collar jobs.                
                

            
                By all accounts, Pawlenty’s image as a likeable and decent public servant is well deserved. However, once working class voters start to give him serious consideration they may conclude his claim to represent them is just another reason to feel that no one is really looking out for them. Pawlenty’s goal is to give them every reason to reach a different conclusion.

Washington's New Four-Letter Word: Snow,"Reuters
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Snow. SNOW! SNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Say the word in Washington, D.C. and you create instant panic and a run on the essential elements of life -- bread, milk and toilet paper.                
                

            
                Most years, that’s all that happens. The mid-Atlantic is right to fear snow. Not because we seldom get the fluffy little bits of terror. No, because what we call snow and what you call snow are likely different.                
                

            
                In the nation’s capital, snow is rightfully a four-letter word. Here temperature often hovers right around freezing. Snow is often shorthand for ice, freezing rain, sleet and worse. Every little terrifying visit brings accidents and closings. Several years ago a surprise quarter-inch snow shut down the metro area for hours. School children arrived home at 10 p.m. because no traffic could move. That’s what snow means in Washington. Add to that a lack of snow emergency equipment compared to areas that get real snow and a fun time is had by all.                
                

            
                That would be bad in most cities, but in D.C. it is horrific. As the capital not just of the United States but of the free world, it draws visitors and refugees from every climate imaginable. Most either know how to drive in real snow, but not ice, or are like Hollywood stars who sneeze at anything this white. Just don’t ask them to drive on it.                
                

            
                Then came the winter of 2009-10. Forget the decadal cycle of one big storm or blizzard that closes schools and frustrates parents. As of today, we’re up to three and counting. D.C. residents have turned to social media like Twitter and FaceBook to vent their frustration with terms like “snOMG,” “snowmageddon,” “snowpocalypse,” and “kaisersnoze.” (You have to love “Usual Suspects” for that last one. Imagine the devil turned mobster and you get how nasty that kind of snow must be.)                
                

            
                In Baltimore, just to the north, the latest storm brought “the winter total snowfall to 64.4,″ which makes the winter of 2009-10 the snowiest winter on record.” And it’s still snowing – hard. A video of Accuweather’s Jim Kosek over-the-top weather forecast for last week’s blizzard went viral. Kosek’s screaming presentation of “our paralyzing, crippling, record-breaking storm,” while amusing, reflects the regional view of the end times nature of winter.                
                

            
                In D.C., where the record total snow of 1888 is also likely to fall today. We’re increasingly running out of places to put the stuff. Unless residents build a 200 ft. high SnObama on the mall (that idea is probably in the stimulus bill somewhere), we’ll end up with mounds and mounds of it everywhere. Secondary roads go unplowed and primary roads become increasingly impassable.                
                

            
                But there is good news.                
                

            
                Yes, in the midst of snOMG, my personal favorite, we find that non-essential parts of the government shut down. Turns out, that’s almost everything except national defense. Wednesday marks the third day in a row that the federal government has closed. While people in D.C. suffer, the nation should rejoice.                
                

            
                Afraid of health care reform? Don’t worry, legislators are snowed out. Worried that Obama is launching yet another global warming initiative? Well, he is, but the latest snowfall has postponed it at least. (Bad marketing that. When will lefties learn to make all their scary climate comments in hot weather?)                
                

            
                The government shutdown, a controversial item when Congress doesn’t pass its budget, becomes an object of ridicule when Mother Nature does it. The Associated Press headlined its story on the issue: “Snow shuts down federal government, life goes on.” Reporter Jessica Gresko asked the all-important question, “If snow keeps 230,000 government employees home for the better part of a week, will anyone notice?”                
                

            
                Yes, we’ll notice and be glad.

Reagan and Obama -- The Big Difference Between These Two Presidents,"Over the past two weeks, there has been incessant chatter about the parallels between the presidencies of Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan, and with good reason: As we celebrate the Gipper’s Centennial birthday today, it’s only natural that he’s back in our focus.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Truth be told, the comparisons began long before the President’s State of the Union address last week, where he seemed to echo Ronald Reagan’s more cherished beliefs, such as corporate tax cuts, a simpler income tax code, a freeze on discretionary spending, and the need for entitlement reform.                
                

            
                As early as the Democratic primary in the winter of 2008, then-candidate Obama proffered Ronald Reagan as a role model to be emulated – much to the Clinton’s chagrin – should he capture the White House. “I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not,” he confessed to reporters during the Nevada primary – an admission that nearly came back to haunt him with Democratic voters.                
                

            
                On the face of it, the comparisons are easy to understand. Like Reagan, Obama is a skillful communicator adept at inspiring audiences and evoking stirring imagery with his words. True enough, Reagan had more of hand in writing his speeches than Obama — a fact that is often overlooked — but there’s no denying that both men rank among the elite talkers to occupy the White House.                
                

            
                And like Reagan, President Obama seems to be affixed with a permanently sunny disposition that only rarely crests from his countenance. Part of both men’s appeal, it has been posited, is attributable in some measure to their belief in our better angels, an uncommon trait among many of their cohorts.                
                

            
                And of course, both came to office during difficult and anxious times. Reagan was greeted by double digit inflation, unemployment, and interest rates – a trifecta of calamities. It was widely regarded as the worst economy since the Great Depression, a phrase that has particular resonance with President Obama, too. It’s hard to imagine a president, save Franklin Roosevelt, stepping into more dire economic circumstances than Obama and Reagan.                
                

            
                But that’s where the comparisons should end. At the heard of the matter, what defined Ronald Reagan most was the resoluteness of his convictions and fidelity to those ideas. He came to the office with a few major goals — to strengthen the economy, restore pride in the military, meet communism head-on, and roll back the influence of government — from which he never wavered. He compromised on occasion, knowing full well that 70 percent of something was better than 100 percent of nothing, but never retreated from the central tenets of his governing philosophy. That was simply out of the question.                
                

            
                Reagan took pride in the fact that his world view could be squeezed onto an index card. Back than it was called simplistic and naïve; today it’s seen as disciplined and focused. He understood — intuitively — that the presidency is essentially a narrative — an arc with a beginning, middle and end— that was built to hold but a few story-lines at a time, a notion that seems to be lost on President Obama. He resisted the temptation — all too common among office holders — to become everything to everybody. If it meant alienating some constituencies or ruffling a few feathers, so be it. He never mistook popularity for posterity.                
                

            
                President Obama has governed a bit differently, at least through his first two years in office. One would be hard pressed to discern a narrative or arc to his presidency, other than the constant vigilance to stave off an economic apocalypse. A noble cause, to be sure — and one that even his harshest critics would have to concede has been successful — but one born of necessity, not philosophy.                 
                

            
                Even health care reform — his signature accomplishment to date — struck a slightly discordant note with his campaign theme, which hardly put an emphasis on universal health care. Why he embarked on overhauling the nation’s health care system during such perilous economic times remains a mystery, and many believe largely responsible for the Democrats’ poor showing in the mid-term elections.                
                

            
                President Obama is smartly tacking to the political center, so the pundits tell us, a course correction as he races towards re-election. Whether it’s just political theater or something more substantive is hard to tell. Either way, it’s certainly reminiscent of another president, though his name is Clinton, not Reagan.

Chief Justice Roberts does the right thing on ObamaCare,"In Marbury v. Madison, the watershed Supreme Court case in 1803 that established the basis of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall referenced the oath of office that all justices take:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich; and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties incumbent on me as according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the constitution and laws of the United States.                
                

            
                That oath, with only minor changes, is the same one taken by Supreme Court justices to this day. Thankfully, Chief Justice John Roberts was paying attention when he repeated it.
 
 The individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act aka ""ObamaCare"" was always, clearly constitutional — so much so that conservatives, recall, were not only the ones who came up with the idea in the first place but generally scoffed at legal challenges when they first raised.                 
                

            
                “It’s become just a very partisan battle cry on behalf of an argument which a few years ago was thought to be completely bogus,” said Charles Fried, President Ronald Reagan’s Solicitor General in Supreme Court cases 1985 to 1989.  
 
 It’s one thing to not like a law. It’s another to suggest that the highest court in the land should overturn centuries of precedent, not to mention the clear tax and commerce power enshrined by our Founders in the Constitution, in order to serve a partisan political agenda.                 
                

            
                In a recent survey conducted by Bloomberg News, 19 of 21 constitutional law scholars — across political affiliations — agreed that the individual mandate in health care reform is constitutional.  Thankfully, conservative Chief Justice Roberts joined the majority decision and ruled that, whether he personally likes it or not, Congress has the power to mandate health insurance coverage.
 
 In 2008, over 88 percent of Americans agreed our health care system was in desperate need of reform. President Obama put forward a plan not to create single payer Medicare system for all (as his progressive base, including myself, wanted) but to fix the crisis of runaway costs and 37 million uninsured Americans by bolstering the private insurance market with the individual mandate.                 
                

            
                It was not accidental that this centerpiece of his plan originated in conservative think tanks and was supported by, among others, Senator John McCain during his run for president.  President Obama went to pains to present a bipartisan solution to our health care crisis.                  
                

            
                Republicans? They did an ideological about-face, declared their wrath against the individual mandate and voted in a block against the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives have been trying to use health care reform as a political football ever since.
 
 Chief Justice Roberts’ vote is so striking precisely because it bucks the recent trend of conservatives contorting their own past beliefs and principles to attack President Obama in any way possible.                  
                

            
                It’s no coincidence that, today, the very same Republicans who decried Congress wasting taxpayer resources on “witch hunts” when George W. Bush was president have launched a grandiose fishing expedition against Attorney General Eric Holder -- not because of ""Fast & Furious,"" which has long been addressed, but because of some far-fetched conspiracy theory about the Justice Department’s own internal investigation.                 
                

            
                To ordinary Americans watching this exchange, it would appear that Republicans are against Congressional committee witch hunts, unless Democrats are the targets, just as Republicans support individual mandate solutions within the private insurance market, unless Democrats propose the idea.                  
                

            
                In 2006, Mitt Romney praised the individual mandate as the solution to our nation’s health care challenges. Now, he has joined the rest of his opportunistic party in condemning it.                 
                

            
                The American public is getting increasingly sick of conservatives flip-flopping on their supposedly core beliefs simply to try and score points against President Obama.  And the Tea Party, which keeps trying to oust any Republican who shows an ounce bipartisanship, isn’t helping.                 
                

            
                Fortunately, no matter how increasingly powerful the extreme right of the Republican Party becomes, they cannot oust Chief Justice John Roberts.                
                

            
                I’m not going to say  that I wasn’t surprised by today's ruling.                
                

            
                A quarter century ago, 2 out of 3 Americans approved of the job the Supreme Court was doing. Today, less than half of Americans feel the same way -- in no small part because 3 out of 4 Americans believe that the justices’ decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal beliefs.                 
                

            
                The Roberts' Court leans right and a number of 5-4 decisions along party lines have overturned centuries of precedent to serve partisan aims (see, e.g., Parents v. Seattle, Gonzalez v. Carhart and of course Citizens United).                  
                

            
                But look, America, sometimes justice manages to be blind to politics and sometimes, just sometimes, even conservatives on the Court realize that we have a federal government for good reason. And, too, sometimes the Constitution that conservatives love to pay lip service to confers all kinds of legitimate powers to government.  It’s a good thing Chief Justice Roberts referred to the Constitution in his decision, and not Twitter.                
                

            
                In Marbury v. Madison, the Court wrote: “The Government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.” Far too often and far more frequently, the five conservative men on the Supreme Court have put politics ahead of the law.                  
                

            
                Today, Chief Justice Roberts upheld a vital act of Congress that will bring down our health care costs, improve the quality of our care and make sure 37 million uninsured Americans have access to affordable insurance.                 
                

            
                But Chief Justice Roberts also upheld the integrity of the Supreme Court on which he sits. We can only hope that today's ruling is a significant step toward restoring the sort of independent rationalism and truth we so desperately needs. In a country far too blinded by partisanship, justice may not really be blind but hopefully it can see better than the rest of us.

Obama Pushes Health Care Reform…Again!,"President Obama is in full campaign mode, now promising to Fix Our Budget Deficits!                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Unfortunately, Mr. Obama as cost-cutter is about as believable as Buffy as Vampire-slayer; meanwhile, the need to rally his liberal base is paramount. Consequently, he has offered up juicy sound bites about hitting up “millionaires and billionaires” and a promise -- not to raise taxes, which might not play well on prime time -- but rather to cut “tax expenditures.”                 
                

            
                In other words, we are now being treated to more Obama gobbledegook, from the same press office that came up with “kinetic military action” and “man-caused disasters”. And – this is a president that ran on transparency!                
                

            
                The president’s budget speech should, however, be welcomed by Republicans. President Obama unwittingly gave the GOP a rallying cry for the 2012 campaign. In (finally) putting forth his proposal to narrow our country’s long-term budget deficits, Mr. Obama all but acknowledged that Medicare and Medicaid – which Obama has called the “single biggest contributors to our long-term deficit” -- remain open sores, oozing red ink into the foreseeable future.                
                

            
                Stop a minute for this to sink in. After all the disruptive skirmishing and chicanery that finally paved the way for Obamacare, we now find that we are again going to the mattresses --- over healthcare costs. Does no one else find this a complete and perfect indictment of the cynically titled Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that Mr. Obama sold the nation? In effect, the president makes clear that his gigantic healthcare bill, that divided the country when it needed healing, did not fix the problem. Republicans should fasten onto this virtual admission like limpets.                
                

            
                Remember the promises? “We agree on reforms that will finally reduce the costs of health care….This plan will strengthen Medicare and extend the life of that program. And because it gets rid of the waste and inefficiencies in our health care system, this will be the largest deficit reduction plan in over a decade.” Moreover, Mr. Obama touted the cost-saving nature of the bill: “whatever ideas exist in terms of bending the cost curve and starting to reduce costs…those elements are in this bill.” Most important, the president emphasized that the bill “has to be budget neutral, it’s got to be deficit neutral…”                
                

            
                It turns out that ObamaCare did not bend the cost curve, was not budget neutral and in fact added to the country’s swollen government healthcare budget. Is anyone surprised?                
                

            
                What is surprising is that President Obama is now ramping up to make the debate over healthcare a cornerstone of his reelection campaign. This is unexpected because so far ObamaCare has not won the president many friends, except from his liberal base. Democrats continue to say the fault is in the messaging – that it was not “sold” properly. Rubbish!                
                

            
                President Obama, who early in his tenure was extremely popular, spent months and months criss-crossing the country, giving dozens of speeches that extolled its virtues. Nonetheless, Americans remain neutral at best on ObamaCare. They would surely be even more negative except that the large taxes incorporated into the bill have not begun to kick in—those were cleverly designed to become effective only after Mr. Obama ran for re-election.                
                

            
                Republicans need to broadcast what the debate over Obama’s health care bill cost the nation. At a time when confidence was shattered by the financial crisis, when businesses were terrified by plummeting demand and needed reassurance, we had instead a president focused on his legacy.                
                

            
                Over the protests of business managers big and small, the president insisted on changing the cost of hiring workers, and flipping upside down existing insurance programs offered to employees. Even as millions of Americans lost their jobs, the president was consumed with the historic nature of his quest.                
                

            
                Economist and former senator Phil Gramm makes the real cost of ObamaCare clear. He compares our current recovery to those that followed the other ten recessions that have occurred since World War II. He says that if this bounce-back had kept pace with those of other cycles, GDP would be significantly higher than it is today, and nearly 12 million more Americans would have jobs. As he acknowledges, Obama supporters will argue that this case was unusual because of the depth of the downturn. Mr. Gramm points out that historically “the bigger the bust, the bigger the boom” that follows. The numbers don’t lie. In past recessions, three years after the downturn, real GDP had increased 7.6% beyond the pre-recession level. Today, GDP is only 0.1% higher.                
                

            
                That, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the real cost of Obamacare. Of course, it is not just the health bill that so unsettled the country, and most importantly the country’s employers. Attempts to change labor rules facilitating union organizing, ramped up antitrust and labor prosecutions, extensive new environmental regulations, the monstrously complex financial bill – they all played a role in setting back our recovery. But Obamacare got the ball rolling.                
                

            
                As we head into the 2012 campaign, Republicans should ask voters, why should you give President Obama another shot at fixing the double disasters of Medicare and Medicaid? Hasn’t he damaged our country enough?

Why Obama-World Is Dangerous,"Although he's 48-years-old President Obama is, in many ways, still just a lost boy. He seeks to live, not in the real world, but in a utopia. His insistence on living in this world -- though it may appear attractive to the uneducated, neglected and naive -- is dangerous and impacts every American.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As the first pundit in America to predict Mr. Obama's political rise and electoral success, it is with great regret that I say the following: President Obama is not a strong leader. His willingness to cede most of his domestic agenda to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has cost him dearly in his first year. And his unwillingness to admit that the world is at a crossroads is a demonstration of his paralysis as a leader on the most important questions of our time.                
                

            
                His rejection by the International Olympic Committee last week in Copenhagen was a stinging rebuke. And it confirmed not only his global impotence but also his inability to successfully push through projects he supports. It also revealed that the president has been relying on nothing more than his personality to win the day.                
                

            
                President Obama believes his good press far too often, relies too much on support from his trusted advisers -- instead of being open to genuine critical analysis -- and seems to feel that the American people are too ""unevolved"" to understand his political message and methods. All of these realities are just pushing the president further into an altered state. They're shaping his worldview and it's having a disastrous impact on the lives of average Americans.                
                

            
                Take the latest jobs report, for example. The report finds that the American people are suffering under an unemployment rate that is almost at 10 percent. And that's not all --the more realistic, unofficial unemployment rate puts the figure at about 17 percent. Why? Because many Americans have simply stopped looking for a job. A proven strategy to grow the economy and jump start a hiring trend would be to keep tax incentives for small business from disappearing in 2010. And the president shouldn't stop there he should add to them and allow the free market to work its magic. Working to expand a robust economy is the only answer to serious unemployment. But the president seems to believe that if he just has the right czar, in the right position, then job losses can be controlled. In the president's utopia, employment and the number of jobs available are fixed and finite, and ""saving them"" is better than or, at minimum, equal to ""creating them.""                
                

            
                Then there's health care. New poll numbers from Rasmussen find that the majority of the American people support health care reform but they do not, under any circumstances, support a government controlled ""public option"" -- or takeover -- of the industry. But President Obama doesn't seem to grasp the expressed will of the people who elected him. In the president's utopia it is *doctors,* not trial lawyers, that are being selfish and charging people for procedures they don't need just to ""make a buck."" In the world you and I live in, we know that doctors run the risk of a massive lawsuit every time they deliver bad news to a patient.                
                

            
                In Afghanistan, President Obama has deliberated for over a month about about whether to expand our footprint there by no more than 40,000 troops. While the military commanders he put in place to do the job beg him for more troops 43 more soldiers have died. Mr. Obama met with General McChrystal for less than an hour on Air Force One when he was in Copenhagen (but for only the second time since commissioning McChrystal to the theater), while Vice President Biden continues to whisper in his ear that things in the region are not working. In President Obama's utopia he wishes that war did not exist, but he has yet to realize that the threat from not dealing with it could be the worst scenario of all.                
                

            
                On Iran, President Obama has issued a stern assessment of the rogue nation's nuclear ambitions. In President Obama's utopia, stern words should be enough. They should cause a reasonable world leader to be so concerned that they will pick up the phone and iron out the differences by the afternoon. Yet even after the IAEA's meetings on Iran, even after the president issued another stern deadline, the administration has begun to backtrack. In President Obama's utopia, the United States is not superior to other nations. That's why we are powerless when we try to suggest what they should do. In fact, in President Obama's utopia, if we simply give up our weapons he believes the bad guys will give up theirs.                
                

            
                When it comes to the economy, ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" sounds good. In a perfect world, such purity of goodness would be a place where we'd all like to live. But it would also be a place no one on this planet would recognize. In President Obama's utopia, the socialists and the communists DO have it right. Maybe this is why, in his memoirs, the president writes about how delighted he was to hang out with them in college. But the depravity of the human race has always been -- and will always be -- the fatal flaw in socialist and communist theory.                
                

            
                Finally, there is America's image in the world. In President Obama's utopia he is fine with the idea of ""American Exceptionalism"" being challenged or even turned upside down. Yet in reality no country has suffered more loss of its own, for the welfare of others, in history. To Obama, an America that stands tall in contrast to others seems arrogant. To our enemies, an America that seems ashamed of herself seems weak.                
                

            
                President Obama is not a strong decision maker -- most law professors aren't. They are too accustomed to arguing issues from all sides. The president is also a man who envisions a world that will never exist. It is his inability to recognize this flawed vision that makes our country more vulnerable, more hopeless and one with a bleak future, at least in the short run. It is, in a word, dangerous.

Obama Doesn’t Know What's Right From Wrong,"What’s wrong with President Obama and his administration is that they don’t know rights from wrongs.
They are more concerned with:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                • The PLO’s rights rather than the PLO’s wrongs. In inviting Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington to restart peace talks after a two-year hiatus, Obama perpetuated the illusion that the PLO has any credibility as a reliable partner. The PLO has repeatedly reinforced its commitment to kill Jews and destroy Israel. For decades, the PLO has misappropriated countless billions in U.S. and foreign aid. Before it gets negotiating “rights” the PLO needs to demonstrate through actions that it is capable of renouncing violence and corruption and that it can honor—rather than consistently violate—any agreement.

• An Imam’s Rights Rather than an Imam’s Wrongs. Obama buys into the “religious rights” argument of Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf to build a $100-million mosque and Muslim cultural center near Ground Zero. But the issue is how wrong the location is. Obama also disregards Rauf’s refusal to acknowledge Hamas as a terrorist group and Rauf’s assertion that U.S. foreign policy caused 9/11. The president must realize that Rauf misused his “goodwill” trip to the Middle East (funded by taxpayer dollars!) as a publicity and fundraising stunt.

• Terrorists’ Rights Rather Than Terrorists’ Wrongs. The Obama “Justice” Department has dropped the prosecution of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the accused coordinator of the Oct. 2000 suicide attack on the USS Cole in Yemen. It has also granted Miranda rights (the ""right to remain silent"") to the Christmas Day and Times Square bombers and it fights to provide civilian (rather than military) trial rights to terrorists including admitted 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Terrorists terrorize us twice when our legal system uses wrong reasoning to give them “rights.”                
                

            
                • Unions’ Rights Rather Than Unions’ Wrongs. Obama has given unions sweetheart deals that raise corruption and cronyism to obscene levels. For example, in the government takeover of General Motors, as The New York Post reported, the Obama-supporting United Auto Workers got: “a remarkable 17.5 percent of the stock plus $2.5 billion in cash plus $6.5 billion in preferred stock carrying a dividend of about 9 percent. In other words, the UAW got three to four times as much as [private] bondholders for a smaller claim on GM's assets. The union even boasted to its members in May 2009 that it had made no concessions on pay, health care or pensions in the restructuring. In effect, the government divided up GM's creditors into favored and unfavored groups, then gave a fat stake in the reorganized business to the favored (aka longtime Democratic Party donors).” Whether it’s health care reform, educational reform or any other kind of reform, Obama and his administration always find ways to serve up sweet treatments for unions and sour treatments for the public.                
                

            
                • Illegal Immigrants’ Rights Rather Than Illegal Immigrants’ Wrongs. The Obama administration’s insistence that the federal government has exclusive authority over immigration laws has resulted in the perpetuation of abuses by illegal immigrants and in the Justice Department suing Arizona for trying to enforce immigration laws that the feds either won’t or can’t. A recent study conducted by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) says harboring illegal immigrants costs an average of $1,117 for every “native-headed” household in America. FAIR estimates that $52 billion is spent on schooling the children of illegals, $28.6-billion is spent by the federal government in “illegal related costs” and state and local budgets are crippled with $84.2 billion in illegal immigrants’ costs. One example FAIR gives is that the $21.8-billion California spends on illegal immigration is $8 billion more than the state’s current budget deficit of $13.8 billion. For those who argue that FAIR is being unfair, it is indisputable that illegal immigrants are inflicting enormous costs on our health, educational and criminal prevention systems. Illegal behavior should not be a passport to undue “rights.”                
                

            
                • Financial Scammers’ Rights Rather than Financial Scammers’ Wrongs. Take your pick: certain Wall Street firms, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AIG, mortgage brokers and borrowers—the list seems endless. Obama and his administration have created moral hazard and monetary mayhem with the nation’s financial system and have battered, bruised and scorned law-abiding, taxpaying Americans. In Obama’s upside down world of bailouts, handouts, buyouts, copouts, and sellouts, the wrongdoers get rewarded and the right doers get punished.                
                

            
                How can a president be right when he and his administration can’t tell rights from wrongs?

DANA PERINO: Beware of Democrats' OTHER Public Option,"While Americans were becoming increasingly disenchanted with the health care reform proposals passed by Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, another government takeover proposal was in the works. -- This time the Democrats want the federal government to be in charge of student loans.

After health care, families point to education as the most important part of a family savings plan. Some families are not able to afford the tuition and fees at many of our colleges and universities, and so they have to turn to lenders to help them out. These loans are seen as a good investment because by getting a higher education the student will improve his or her earning capacity that will allow them to pay off the loan when they land a good paying job after school. A wide range of options has existed for a long time to help families choose the right option for them, but those options are on the chopping block.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Last fall, the Democrats passed legislation to create a “public option” for student loans and the next step in its passage is in the Senate. The only think that's holding Democrats back from passing this legislation is the tricky business of trying to get the health care bill passed in time for the president to have a grand signing ceremony before his State of the Union address.

If you thought the public option -- as it was proposed for health care was bad, get a load of this: the student loan legislation does not just set up a government-run option for student lending, the bill makes the government the only option! It promises to bring complete federalization of the student loan process to a private marketplace. Iowa Democrat Sen. Tom Harkin’s plan for the bill is to jam this single-payer student loan system through an unpopular process known as ""reconciliation,"" all the while ignoring any of the bipartisan alternatives that have been presented. -- A truly odd decision coming off a contentious health care fight that’s left the majority of Americans with a bad taste in their mouths.

As with the shadowy and confusing language of the health care debate, you have to get past the rhetoric that sounds perfectly reasonable to figure out what is really going on. Their words reflect a desire to keep choice and competition in the student loan market. During his September health care address to Congress the president said: “My guiding principle is and always has been that consumers do better when there is choice and competition. That's how the market works.” In a cable news interview last year, Harkin said: “The one thing, I think, the people understand that we have to have is, we have to have choice and competition.”

On that we may all be able to agree -- but that’s not at all how their student loan bill works. It would not only eliminate all choice and competition in the student lending market, but it also would risk tens of thousands of private sector job losses -- the last thing we need with double-digit unemployment.

One thing is certain, consumers see the best results when they are empowered to choose which options best suit their needs. Maintaining a diverse array of private student lenders -- for-profits and non-profits, local and national -- would ensure that a retail market is preserved as a means to promote innovation and customer service excellence. Just as none of us want to be forced into a health insurance policy that pays for things we don’t want or need, it’s also a mistake when a high school senior only has one government-mandated option to finance their college education.

If Congress wants Americans to have health care and student loans that work for them, they should support reforms that *drive down* costs and let families shop around for the products best suit their needs. The principles of “choice and competition” cannot just be meaningless, throw-away lines that the Democrats use when they want to get their way. Republicans and like-minded Democrats should ensure that these principles are maintained in the student loan market in order to preserve jobs in a tough economy and prevent the country from spiraling further into debt.

When it comes to student loans, the last thing Americans need is another government takeover. Everyone better pay attention to what’s going on while all eyes are fixed on the health care bill, or that’s exactly what’s going to happen.

Jose Calderon: Now We Need to Advance a Pro-Latino Agenda in Washington,"LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 05:  Voters go to the polls for Super Tuesday primaries in the predominantly Latino neighborhood of Boyle Heights on February 5, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Latinos are an increasingly important factor in California where they are expected to account for 14 percent of the vote and tend to favor presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) over rival Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL). At 44 million, Latinos make up15 percent of the US population, the nation's largest minority group according to the latest Census Bureau estimates.

                Election Day was a historic show of strength for the Latino community. As a friend of mine said, ""we got on the electoral bus and took a front seat.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Indeed, across the United States, Latinos made their way to the polls in droves on Election Day and made history. A record of roughly 12 million Latinos turned out to vote on Tuesday and for the first time made up 10 percent of the electorate.                
                

            
                Latino voters made the difference in deciding the Presidential Election with nearly three-quarters voting to reelect President Obama and were specifically key to the outcome in several swing states including Florida, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada. We also helped elect a record 31 Latinos to Congress and 276 state legislators across 36 states.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Our leaders must find a path to preserve and expand these essential programs that voters clearly stood up for
					
		   				- Jose Calderon
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                None of this would have been possible without Latino and community-led voter registration and mobilization efforts in many states in 2012. For instance, the organization I represent, the Hispanic Federation, made well over 100,000 calls and door knocks to get our community out to vote in this historic election. Many of our sister organizations have similar stories of voter impact that they can share. According to a pre-election ImpreMedia-Latino Decisions Poll, as many as 1 in 7 Latinos nationwide were contacted by a community organization in recent months to register or vote. That is almost on par with the major political party efforts targeting Latino voters.                
                

            
                So what does this mean for Latinos moving forward? Clearly there is much work to be done to advance a pro-Latino agenda in Washington and states across the country. For starters, as Washington debates the approaching ""fiscal cliff"", it is vital that voters hold the line on drastic cuts to education and social service programs that are intended to lift up our people and improve our economy. Our leaders must find a path to preserve and expand these essential programs that voters clearly stood up for.

                On health care, the voters - and the Supreme Court - have spoken and the debate is over on whether the President's Affordable Care Act is the right direction for this country. It's time for states to implement health care reform.                
                

            
                On the economy, too many of our neighbors and family members need a better paying job. It's beyond time for Congress to work with the President to invest in our workforce in the form of infrastructure repairs, green jobs and workforce development training. After Hurricane Sandy, it is also clear we need to invest in our transportation and power systems to better prepare for our changing climate.                
                

            
                On education, our communities are plagued with failing public schools. Our federal and state governments need to get serious about nation-building here at home by investing in a well-educated citizenry through a focus on smaller class sizes, college readiness, parental empowerment and a stronger, larger, more bilingual teacher core. We must also stand strong against proposed cuts to college Pell Grants that provide a path to the middle class for so many Latinos.                
                

            
                And we have waited far too long for just and humane national immigration reform. The President's Deferred Action for Youth Arrivals (DACA) Initiative, while important, is only a start and a temporary one at that. Congress must pass the DREAM Act and a broad legalization bill. And Congress needs to rethink the future of immigration when it comes to reuniting families and recruiting needed workers.                
                

            
                As resounding as our mobilization was on Election Day, our work is far from done. Each of us must engage in pushing our government officials to deliver these needed reforms and investments. Now it's time to make the calls and travel to our capitol to demand what we know is right and long overdue. In other words, now we must steer that 'electoral bus' to a destination that addresses our policy needs and aspirations.

Understanding Reconciliation and the Nuclear Trigger,"Health care reform legislation is mired in public disapproval. There is a lot of discussion about using special reconciliation procedures in order to pass the legislation in the Senate. What is not being discussed is the need for a nuclear trigger to make it happen.

The use of standard reconciliation procedures is mostly being pushed by those who have little understanding of how this complex process operates. The problem has nothing to do with whether or not it is appropriate to use these special procedures to make drastic changes to one-sixth of our economy. That is a political decision.

The problem lies with the complexity of the health care reform legislation that is proposed. That legislation does not fit within the restrictions of reconciliation rules designed to address spending and revenue issues. The health care reform legislation contains many policy changes that do not directly affect the federal budget. Under the reconciliation rules, these provisions could be stripped from the bill before a vote in the Senate.

The bill remaining, after it has been sliced and diced to remove non-compliant provisions, will be ugly and unworkable.

Another strategy discusses using two bills. This would require the House passing the Senate bill and then cleaning up all the remaining problems with a second bill that would move under reconciliation rules. This has been dubbed “the sidecar strategy.” It suffers the same problems as a large reconciliation bill.

However, there is one strategy under discussion to pass a comprehensive bill under reconciliation procedures, but it requires a nuclear trigger. It requires shredding the rules of the Senate by a fiat issued by Vice President Joe Biden.

The parliamentary procedure is complex, but important to democracy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In order to keep the bill intact, the Democrats are discussing a procedure to have Biden ignore the rule of law -- and the ruling of the Senate Parliamentarian -- and tell the Senate to proceed because the rules do not matter.

Any challenge to provisions in the health care reconciliation bill upheld by the Parliamentarian would simply be overruled by Joe Biden.

This is very different from the fight over judicial nominees from a few years ago. Senate Republicans threatened to have Vice President Dick Cheney rule that the Senate had a constitutional obligation to force votes on judicial nominations to fulfill the “advice and consent” requirement of appointments made by the president.

The current controversy is over legislation. The Constitution allows the Senate to set its own rules -- which has been done. This nuclear trigger option would simply ignore the rules that are in place.

To stop Biden from shredding the rules of the Senate, any senator could appeal the ruling of the chair. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would then be recognized by Biden to make a motion to table the motion appealing the ruling of the chair. This is not debatable and only needs a simple majority to pass.

This change would adopt a very dangerous precedent. This is the nuclear trigger that would shred the rule of law that enacted the reconciliation procedures and allow them to be waived on the whim of Vice President Joe Biden.

                Confronted by the mass-uprising against the Democrats' plans to take over health care in the name of reform, the left-wing message machine has kicked into high gear..                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Desperate to explain away enormous citizen responses to nearly every public appearance by a member of Congress in recent days, the Soros-backed Center for American Progress issued the new talking points on Friday.  Their claim:                 
                

            
                Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, which orchestrated the anti-Obama tea parties earlier this year, are now pursuing an aggressive strategy to create an image of mass public opposition to health care and clean energy reform.                 
                

            
                Within days, as usual, The New York Times, the White House, and the full constellation of so-called progressive interests were following their lead. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called it ""manufactured anger,"" which is such delicious irony as he parrots the talking points from the Center for American Progress.                
                

            
                As one of the senior staff members at Americans for Prosperity, I'm flattered that the power to ""manufacture"" massive, widespread anger is attributed to us.  If we had that skill, I'm sure we would have won a few more fights in recent years.                  
                

            
                The reality is people join our organization and other free market grassroots groups like FreedomWorks, the National Taxpayers Union, and RecessRally.com because they are angry about what's going on and they want to make a difference.  They tell us what's important and worth fighting for, not the other way around.  We just send them news about what's happening in Washington and let them know about opportunities to get involved in their areas.  We provide information.  They are already highly motivated.                
                

            
                On April 15th we saw more than a million people take to the street during the tea parties, a scale of action so broad that any claims of being artificially ""manufactured"" were on their face absurd.  All over the country people who normally go about their daily lives, worrying about work and family, are so fed up with the direction in Washington that they are getting politically involved for the first time in their lives.                
                

            
                One of our goals at Americans for Prosperity is to help them to be the most effective activists they can be.  We are trying to teach people who haven't been involved before that calling and writing to people other than their own representatives is counterproductive, because it clogs the lines and blocks real constituent calls from getting through.  We are telling people not to be disruptive or violent, to keep things civil and be sure their voices are heard.                
                

            
                That some situations have got out of control is unfortunate, and it is something we are working hard to stop.  The anger that is being seen at town hall meeting is far from manufactured.  It is genuine, heartfelt, deeply felt, and increasingly widespread.  Polling shows that the anger on display at town hall meeting is representative of the overall public: according to the latest Rasmussen Reports poll, the public is now opposed to the health care reform being debated in Congress by 49 percent to 47, which is close, but those who strongly oppose far outnumber those who strongly support the reform by 41 percent to just 25 percent.                
                

            
                Certainly, groups like Americans for Prosperity have a role to play in the protests we are seeing, and we're proud that we are helping people connect and getting them the information they need to be effective activists.  But it wouldn't be possible without the tens of thousands of real people who are giving up time from their lives and families to make a difference.  Our health care effort, joinpatientsfirst.com is supported by donations from thousands of patients across the country who are concerned about what a Washington takeover of health care means for them.  Members of Congress who follow the Center for American Progress talking points as an excuse to ignore real grassroots anger over health care may learn how real it is come election day 2010.

What the Voters Said,"The electorate sent a very clear message to President Obama, and indeed, the leaders of the two major parties Tuesday that they want them to pursue a very different approach to politics and policy going forward.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Make no mistake; this was at its core an anti-incumbent election. Liberal Democratic administrations in Virginia and New Jersey were ousted as voters embraced an anti-tax, smaller government approach, in both instances following more than eight years of Democratic rule.
In both New Jersey or Virginia, the hundreds of thousands of new voters who registered to vote for the first time last year to put both states in President Obamaâ€™s column, were nowhere in evidence Tuesday.                
                

            
                The results in New York's 23rd Congressional District also involved the ousting of the incumbent party, but here the message was different and just as blunt: if the GOP nominates a right wing candidate out of the mainstream, he too will face defeat at the polls â€“ even if he is backed by the national party and prominent party leaders like Sarah Palin.                
                

            
                Independents led the way in both Virginia and New Jersey â€“ voting Republican by close to 2-1 margins in each state. But in New York, it was a different story as independents embraced Democrat Bill Owens and soundly rejected the right-wing Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman, after the Republican candidate, Dede Scozzafava, dropped out of the race last week. Even some moderate Republicans crossed the partisan divide to support Owens, given the nature and effect of Hoffmanâ€™s right-wing message and out of district supporters.                
                

            
                Indeed, the only incumbent managing to survive â€“albeit with a reduced majority â€“ was New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who ran an explicit and avowed centrist campaign, putting progress before partisanship. What then is the message voters are sending to Washington?
Tuesday's election results suggest quite clearly that voters of all perspectives want an end to partisan fighting, and explicitly want their leaders to pursue a bipartisan agenda, involving conciliation and compromise, not fighting, scapegoating, and divisive politics. In policy terms, both parties should understand these results to be a clarion call for compromise on health care reform.                
                

            
                There is clearly little appetite for a trillion dollar plus plan with a public option. Instead, it is clear that the administration and Republicans can agree on a less expensive reform measure that expands coverage incrementally, providing insurance reform involving pre-existing conditions, and portability, and likely to involve experiments involving both tort reform and competition across state lines.                
                

            
                The electorate is also clearly in no mood for a polarizing fight over climate change and instead seems open to the type of bipartisan agenda John Kerry and Lindsay Graham proposed last week involving both investing in alternative energy, as well as ocean drilling and the selective use of nuclear power. The embrace this week of this agenda by the Chamber of Commerce provides additional impetus for quick Congressional action.                
                

            
                In the spring of this year, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said explicitly that the administration would embrace broad based immigration reform, providing a path to citizenship for those already here and explicitly cracking down on illegal immigration. And shortly thereafter former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former Clinton chief of Staff Mack McLarty authored a Council on Foreign relations white paper urging a â€œfundamental overhaulâ€� of our immigration laws, and advancing a comprehensive bipartisan plan that deserves prompt attention.                
                

            
                And given that unemployment is approaching 10%, notwithstanding the 3.5% economic growth recorded last quarter, Congress and the administration need to move to create private sector jobsâ€”and to do that quickly.                
                

            
                The best way for the administration and Democrats in Congress to do that is to work with the Republicans on a series of tax incentives involving tax credits for hiring as well as considering a temporary payroll tax holiday. Leaders of both parties have already spoken approvingly of these initiatives and if the administration gets behind them we could have a spurt of hopefully lasting job creation initiatives by the second quarter of 2010.                
                

            
                And more fundamentally, the electorate delivered an even more profound message: change your tone, lower your voices, get things done. There is widespread suspicion of and antipathy toward our leaders in Washington, regardless of position and regardless of party. There has been no lasting swing to the Republicans, though the Obama administration and the Democrats need to understand that as the incumbent party controlling both branches of government, they are most likely to be held accountable next year.                
                

            
                But that being said, Tuesday's election results send a very clear message to everyone in Washington from a very frustrated and angry electorate: change your ways.

Carter's Courage,"In the past few days, former President Jimmy Carter has caused a national firestorm by remarking that much of the current opposition to President Obama is rooted in racism. As expected, the racist wing of the GOP quickly dismissed Carter's comments as wrongheaded and divisive. In truth, however, President Carter was merely identifying a political reality that many of us have been unable or unwilling to recognize: much of the current anti-Obama sentiment has little to do with policy and much to do with race.

Since becoming the Democratic party's nominee last May, President Obama has been the victim of the most racist smear campaign in American political history. From the xenophobic investigations into his religious background to the moonbatish birther controversy, the right-wing political machine has gone to extravagant lengths to paint Obama as an uppity, untrustworthy, and unprincipled outsider whose very existence represents a threat to the American way of life.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Although the language of race has rarely been explicitly invoked, terms like ""Marxist,"" ""Nazi,"" ""extremist,"" and ""foreigner"" have been used to smuggle racism and xenophobia into the public conversation without political consequence.

Of course, this is not to suggest that everyone who opposes President Obama is a racist. To the contrary, there have been numerous legitimate reasons to challenge the president's policies and plans since the beginning of his term. Unfortunately, even the most legitimate critiques have too often been cloaked in a deeply racidicalized veil that appeals to the most vulgar sensibilities within our country.                 
                

            
                I have witnessed this firsthand at several of the health care town halls, where angry white citizens gathered not to talk about policy details, but to vent their anger that ""this guy"" was changing ""their country"" by trying to give health care to ""those people.""                 
                

            
                While strong opposition to health care reform existed during the presidency of Bill Clinton -- whose health care plan was far less moderate than the current proposals-- the 1993 protests were relatively devoid of personal animus and vile ad hominem attacks. In the case of Obama, however, many citizens are closing ranks around racial anger and fear rather than a principled and unified political vision.

Still, despite mounds of evidence, the left has refused to substantively address the racist dimensions of the current assaults on Obama. This is largely due to the Republican Party's masterful manipulation of our nation's racial anxieties. As soon as Obama became the Democratic nominee, Right-wingers began complaining that they could not critique President Obama without being labeled racist. Despite being completely unfounded-- both Obama and his liberal defenders have been loath to address issues of race except under extreme political duress-- such arguments have placed Democrats in an all-too-familiar defensive and reactionary posture. Instead of speaking out aggressively against racist tactics, they opt to say nothing to avoid being accused of exploiting race.

As a result of the right's preemptive strike on the racial front, liberals have remained dangerously silent in the face of the most egregious acts of racism against Obama to date. It is for this reason that Representative Joe Wilson could heckle Obama during his Congressional address and only be challenged for his rudeness rather than his racism. Although he has received a formal reprimand from the House of Representatives (the political equivalent of an after-school detention) such a punishment is nothing more than a badge of honor that enhances Wilson's street cred amongst those who were happy to see the nation's first black president ""put in his place."" This type of political cowardice from Democrats only emboldens the right to continue prosecuting its war of racial terror.

By identifying the racial dimensions of the current political moment, President Carter has pointed out a huge elephant in the room. Until the rest of the Democratic Party musters the courage to do the same on a regular basis, President Obama will continue to take unnecessary hits. And so will our national character.

"President Trump is a change agent, the Washington establishment hates change - cue sound and fury","President Donald Trump was elected our nation’s 45th president not beholden to Washington or any special interest in its swamp.  President Trump is a change agent unlike any President the American people have ever seen.  He’s the first non-politician to be elected president since General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952.   President Trump was elected as a successful businessman to break up Washington’s failed status quo.  What we are witnessing is the ultimate political outsider enacting real change.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                So all the sound and fury emanating from Washington? That’s what it sounds like when an entrenched political class that is radically averse to change is forced to confront it, head-on. And all the noise is obscuring one very important fact, and that is that 161 days into the Trump Presidency – once you cut through the permanent obstruction campaign being waged by the Democrats and all the noise emanating from the liberal media – genuine progress is being made on the Trump agenda.

                This week’s unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court ordering that the President’s executive order on immigration can largely take effect is an enormous victory for the White House and our national security.  The Supreme Court put its stamp of approval on the fact that the President of the United States has the power to secure our country and that our immigration vetting system needs major improvement. 
                
                


                
            
                This major step on immigration reform creates momentum for the great strides Senate Republicans are already making to fix our nation’s broken health care system.   It’s widely accepted that ObamaCare is failing and has been failing for a long time.  Americans want better health care and more affordable health care.  This is the essence of what President Trump and Congressional Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are working non-stop to accomplish.  The Democrats by contrast hold the position that it is acceptable to let ObamaCare falter completely.  Make no mistake; the choice on the future of health care is simple.   Republicans are pushing for common sense reform and the Democrats are holding on to a failed system that is going to crash.
                
                


                
            
                Through President Trump’s “America First” leadership, much progress has already been made.  The nomination and confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch for example is a promise made and a promise kept by our president.  This widely praised decision sent a signal to the American people that this president will appoint only supremely qualified defenders of the Constitution to our nation’s highest court.   Similarly, President Trump’s consequential decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord makes clear he is prioritizing the economic interests of the United States of America and the American worker first and foremost.
                
                


                
            
                Additionally, last week President Trump continued to make good on his pledge to prioritize the men and women who have heroically served our country by signing into law the Veterans Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.  This law is a key part of the President’s reform agenda that will hold employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs more accountable and help to make sure the federal government is giving our veterans the unparalleled respect that they deserve.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Going forward, it is critically important that the U.S. Senate continue to improve their health care reform legislation and get it to President Trump’s desk for his signature.  This landmark accomplishment will enable our country to finally move on from the divisive ObamaCare years and onto policy measures such as tax reform which will make dramatic economic gains and job creation become a reality.  Job creators at businesses both large and small are craving for some economic certainty from our federal government.  They want the certainty that taxes and regulations are going to be cut and that our tax code will be streamlined for the hardworking taxpayers that they employ.  These optimistic pro-growth reforms are something that the American people will rally around.  Hopefully some Senate Democrats from states President Trump carried will feel the same way.
                
                


                
            
                Yes, getting the Washington establishment to change its ways is hard, but President Trump is achieving positive results for the American people that he represents each and every day.

                Repealing and replacing ObamaCare and implementing President Trump’s plan to build $1 trillion-worth of infrastructure are massively important for the president’s bold vision to make America great again, but the key to President Trump's success is tax reform.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Many congressional Republicans are eager to solve the ObamaCare crisis and have gone forward with what they can do under reconciliation to stop the bleeding.                
                

            
                President Trump acknowledged this to congressional leaders in a meeting yesterday.                
                

            
                But tax reform – as well as an infrastructure plan – will be the foundation for giving Republicans the momentum and moral authority to move ahead and fully reform the nation’s health care system.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            A stronger, more business-friendly economy will help ease tensions for both health care reform and infrastructure construction. Democrats will have a harder time opposing a Republican president who is overseeing a boost in job creation and economic growth during the long-term health care debate. 
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                The Republican repeal effort to reform health care will likely result in a bitter partisan fight. Probably no Democrat will vote to repeal ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Once the initial repeal is achieved by a purely partisan vote, we will need to rebuild ties with moderate Democrats to get things done.                
                

            
                We will need positive reforms in other areas that will bring some Democrats into a bipartisan coalition.                
                

            
                Momentum is exactly what Republicans need to fully liberate this country from the entitlement state system that has dominated American government for a half-century. It is critical that Republicans are strategic about fixing the health care system and that it be surrounded by other issues.                
                

            
                After the president’s address to the Joint Session of Congress last week, I predicted his massive infrastructure plan will win over about a third of the Democrats. However, it will face scrutiny from Republicans concerned about finding ways to pay for it – even though I’m confident President Trump will negotiate a much lower price tag, develop public private partnerships, and reduce costs by eliminating reams of burdensome rules from the Code of Federal Regulations.                
                

            
                A stronger, more business-friendly economy will help ease tensions for both health care reform and infrastructure construction. Democrats will have a harder time opposing a Republican president who is overseeing a boost in job creation and economic growth during the long-term health care debate. And increased revenues from business growth will make a large infrastructure plan easier for budget-conscious Republicans to accept – especially when a stronger economy is leading the nation toward a balanced budget.                
                

            
                The first major step Congress should take is to reform the tax system so companies are incentivized to invest and build factories in the United States and create good-paying jobs.                
                

            
                Speaker Paul Ryan has a plan that will do these things through a border adjustment tax, which is the right first step toward tax reform.                
                

            
                I recently spoke with a group of about 30 major American investors, and they expressed tremendous support for a border adjustment tax. Under our current tax system, it makes more sense for companies to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States, produce products in lower-wage countries, and then export their goods back to the U.S., because we do not impose corporate tax on imports.                
                

            
                Think about that. Our current tax system is essentially designed to drive production out of the United States. Companies who remain in the U.S. pay the highest business tax in the world and pay American workers American-level wages. Meanwhile, they are competing with companies who are paying foreign workers incredibly low wages – and paying no corporate taxes.                
                

            
                With a border adjustment tax, we would tax imports – just like more than 160 other countries that have either a value-added tax on imports, a border adjustment tax, or both.                 
                

            
                Right now, the United States is in the extreme minority of countries without a border adjustment tax – along with North Korea and South Sudan.                
                

            
                Reducing taxes on businesses and individuals, and reducing regulations, will cause more companies to invest in America again. The Tax Foundation reports that Speaker Ryan’s plan will create about 1.7 million jobs in America, and increase Gross Domestic Product by more than 9 percent.                
                

            
                Tax reform will provide the boost in jobs and production President Trump and Republicans in Congress need to build legislative momentum and implement the president’s infrastructure plan. Republicans will then be able to move from a clear position of strength as they deliberately and methodically rebuild our health care system.

Our Health Care Mess Is a Symptom of a Much Bigger Problem,"Just in case you’ve missed it, there has been a lot of debate recently about reforming our nation’s health care system. The president and his allies in Congress have told us they have just the ticket to fix our problems: a plan that creates a new federal government insurance company and pays for it by raising taxes on just about everyone and cutting nearly $500 billion from Medicare.
Their plan takes an unsustainable mountain of government debt, bureaucracy and spending, then bulldozes a new mountain of bureaucracy and debt right on top of it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But for all of the mind-boggling complexity and numbers we’ve heard, this debate is about much more than health care. It’s about how we find ourselves in a situation where we are debating the best way to give the government control over another big part of our lives and our economy.                
                

            
                In the story of Hansel and Gretel, the children drop a trail of breadcrumbs as they walk through the forest, so they will be able to find their way home again. But when birds eat the breadcrumbs, the children find they are lost in the dark and frightening woods.                
                

            
                Well, lost in the woods is exactly where we find ourselves as a country right now. We know we’re in trouble, but there’s no clearly marked path to get us back to where we were, and it’s plenty frightening.

In the past year alone, government has taken over two automakers, insurance companies and hundreds of banks. It has bailed out Wall Street and attempted to stimulate the economy by taking a trillion dollars out of the private sector and spending it on wasteful government programs. It has thrown taxpayer money at people to encourage them to buy new cars and houses, and it is looking at imposing massive new job-killing taxes on businesses in the name of reducing “global warming.”                
                

            
                All of these things have happened because we’ve stopped asking, “Should government attempt to solve this problem?” Instead, we start by asking, “How should government fix the problem?” It’s now considered a sign of admirable restraint to occasionally ask, “How much should we spend?” And somehow we started thinking that anything less than a trillion dollars is a bargain.                
                

            
                This matters not just because of our unsustainable debt and the huge amounts of money we waste. It matters because every time we give a job to the government, we take away some control that people have over their lives, and we take away a little bit more of their freedom. In return for letting government try its hand at solving a problem, we as citizens cede our ability to try for ourselves to find a better way.                
                

            
                It’s awkward to admit it, but my colleagues in Congress have led this country into the woods despite our oath of office. We swore to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States and to bear true faith and allegiance to it. The Constitution prescribes a very limited role for the federal government. There is not a word in our oath, or in the Constitution, about most of what we do. As we’ve wandered off the path of liberty, there are few crumbs left of the Constitution in the halls of Congress to lead us out of the woods.                
                

            
                There’s not a word in the Constitution about the government deciding what medical tests private health insurers should pay for. Nothing about the government deciding how much executives on Wall Street should earn, or what kind of light bulbs and cars we should buy. There’s nothing about the thousands of parochial earmarks that fund local bridges to nowhere, golf courses, bike paths, sewer plants, and tea pot museums.                
                

            
                There’s nothing about these or many other things in the Constitution because they have nothing to do with the proper role of a federal government in a free society. But these are exactly the kinds of things our government spends its time and money on, and we don’t even question anymore why that is.                
                

            
                Instead, it’s gotten to the point where if we oppose the government doing anything, we are accused of being opposed to getting it done. That’s patently absurd. If you really want to get something done, and done the right way, the government is the absolute last place we should turn.
The tea parties, town halls and rallies affirm the American people are rethinking the appropriate role of the government in a free society. Hopefully, their discontent will be demonstrated in the 2010 elections. Only the American people can hold our elected federal representatives accountable for fulfilling their oath of office.                
                

            
                In the health care debate, this means deciding exactly what role the government should play to help people and the private sector find solutions, instead of creating a monstrous new bureaucracy that puts the government in charge of every decision. But this debate is about much more than health care. It is a battle for the heart and soul of America. It is a struggle between freedom and socialism, between free markets and a centrally planned economy, and between “We the People” and an entrenched class of elite politicians.                
                

            
                The current debate over health care reform is a symptom of a bigger problem in Washington. But it can be the catalyst for a wider debate about the proper role of government in our lives. The same debate can lead us to a moment when Americans finally take a stand to return government to its proper place -- and we all start to find our way out of the woods.

"The Way Forward On Health Care, And No, It's Not Obamacare","Repeal and replace – but also reinvigorate.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The Republican “Pledge to America” promises to repeal the worst aspects of Obamacare. But Republicans should go further and build a bipartisan agenda for biomedical innovation.                
                

            
                Last Thursday, Congressional Republicans revealed a new “Pledge to America,” including a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with commonsense, fiscally sustainable health care reforms that will improve health care and expand access to affordable health insurance.                
                

            
                The Pledge is a sound and bold agenda for reform, starting with the repeal of Democrats’ recently passed $1 trillion budget-busting, job killing, health care legislation. After rolling it back, Republicans would replace it with true interstate insurance competition, medical malpractice reform, expanded Health Savings Accounts, and improved high risk pools for patients with pre-existing conditions.                
                

            
                But Republicans should also promote a bipartisan agenda that will strengthen America’s global leadership in the field of biomedical innovation. By creating a better climate for medical innovation today, policymakers will reap huge dividends from more high paying biotech jobs, new cures for life-threatening diseases, and new treatments that will help Americans remain healthier and more productive as they age -- reducing the strain on government programs like Social Security and Medicare.                
                

            
                For decades, America has been the leader in global biomedical innovation – thanks to public support for basic medical research through the National Institutes of Health, robust intellectual property protection, and a relatively free market for new medical products, among other strengths. But U.S. leadership is eroding, challenged by rapidly advancing biotech sectors in India and China and undermined by a regulatory and political environment that too often sees new medicines as costs to be avoided.                
                

            
                A true innovation agenda would start with tax reform. The U.S. corporate tax rate (the world’s highest, at nearly 40 percent) is a job-killer, encouraging companies to outsource jobs and manufacturing capacity to lower-tax countries. Reducing this rate so that it’s closer to (or even better yet, lower than) the OECD average of 26 percent would be a powerful incentive for more companies to invest in biotechnology jobs and facilities in the United States.                
                

            
                Second, policymakers must find ways to keep more top scientific talent working here. India and China are making every effort to “repatriate” science students that train at U.S. universities – recognizing them as potential entrepreneurs who might start the next Genentech. As Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) wrote in the Washington Post last March: “it makes no sense to educate the world's future inventors and entrepreneurs and then force them to leave when they are able to contribute to our economy.” One of their proposals – to award automatic green cards to foreign students who earn a master’s or Ph.D. in “hard” science fields like biology – could be implemented with very little cost to the federal budget.                
                

            
                Finally, we need to modernize the FDA and overcome the gap between the rapid advances in basic science and the dearth of innovative new drugs actually coming to market. Part of the problem, as the FDA’s own leadership and science board has acknowledged, is that the agency is using 20th century regulatory tools to evaluate 21st century medicines. The result is a cumbersome and expensive process that can take a decade and cost hundreds of millions (or billions) of dollars to generate a single FDA-approved drug.                
                

            
                The FDA currently receives a paltry $18 million for advancing regulatory science, including for its food and veterinary centers. Compare that to the European Commission’s Innovative Medicines Initiative, a $2.5 billion public-private partnership to advance the science of approving new medicines. Republicans should advocate for reforms to make FDA drug approvals faster and more predictable in return for a major funding increase for the FDA’s regulatory science programs – an idea that Democrats should embrace.                
                

            
                Congress should also follow Europe’s lead and fund a joint venture that can help revolutionize how we test and develop new medicines. Budget costs from increased funding for biomedical innovation can be offset in ways that also improve health – for instance, reducing obesity by slashing the billions in annual agricultural subsidies for corn byproducts that flood our grocery stores with cheap junk food.                
                

            
                By expanding their definition of health care reform to include a comprehensive innovation agenda, Republicans can attract support from Democrats and independents for maintaining U.S. leadership in a critical economic sector. Better yet, they can offer hope to millions of patients suffering from chronic and life-threatening illnesses that have few good treatment options today.

"LOTT'S NUMBERS: The Truth About Obama's Health Care Plan, Part 2","""Then there's the problem of rising costs. We spend one-and-a-half times more per person on health care than any other country . . . . health care represents one-sixth of our economy . . . Everyone in this room knows what will happen if we do nothing. Our deficit will grow. More families will go bankrupt. More businesses will close. More Americans will lose their coverage when they are sick and need it most. And more will die as a result."" -- President Obama in his address to a joint session of Congress on health care on  September 9, 2009.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                A number frequently tossed around is that a 1/6th of our nation's income is spent on health care. That number comes from $2.2 trillion in reported health care spending out of an almost $14 trillion economy. The President cites those statistics as evidence that the government needs to step in and keep health care spending under control. Yet, there are problems with both claims: The health care costs used in the debate have been inflated by double counting and further distorted by price controls, and the recent growth in U.S. health care expenditures has actually been less than in countries where the government pays for most health care.

First, take the double counting. The $2.2 trillion number includes not only the direct spending by insurance companies, individuals, and the government on health care, but it also includes the spending on buildings and medical equipment for doctors and hospitals. As should be obvious, you can't count both the money paid by patients for using an MRI and then also count the money that the hospital pays for the MRI. After all, payments for MRI scans typically cover the costs for purchasing the machinery.                
                

            
                The $2.2 trillion number measures all the money ""going into the hands of the major actors in the health sector (providers, suppliers, insurers),"" Dr. Joseph Antos, the Wilson H. Taylor Scholar in Health Care at the American Enterprise Institute, told FOXNews.com. It ""is not a measure of the share of the economy going to services actually produced during the year.""                
                

            
                There are also accounting problems with the money spent on research. The total health care cost figure includes the entire National Institute of Health budget and a large percentage of the National Science Foundation. But much of this money has nothing to do with health research and some is recouped through the products the research creates.

Some of the National Institute of Health money is used for funding the general operation of universities. Professor Bob Hansen, the Senior Associate Dean at the Tuck Business School, notes: ""'overhead' rates on grants from places like the NIH [run] close to 50%, there is also a lot of funding of general university overhead in the NIH budget. Cross country comparisons are rendered problematic when we realize that other countries fund their universities through direct payment rather than through the U.S.'s reliance on 'indirects.'""                
                

            
                This double counting adds up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ about $363 billion. Rather than about 1/6th of GDP, or about 16 percent, going to health care expenditures, the right number is closer to an 1/8th, about 13 percent of GDP. Suddenly the gap with other countries doesn't seem as large. Take France, which spends about 11 percent of its GDP on health care.                
                

            
                The gap with other countries gets even smaller when one takes into account their use of price controls on products such as pharmaceuticals. Americans spend almost twice as much per person on drugs as the average for other countries. U.S.-based drug companies spend vast sums to develop new drugs, and Americans pay market prices for them. Once developed, drugs are reasonably inexpensive to produce and reproduce, and price controls in other countries lower prices so that they often only have to cover the cost of manufacturing and distribution. Other countries thus ""free-ride"" on the research that we make in developing new drugs, drugs that save lives around the world.                
                

            
                If Americans spent as much for drugs as other countries, we could reduce our health care expenditures by another percentage point. But there is a real cost to this. Over the long haul, companies would not keep developing new drugs unless they can recoup the massive costs of research and regulatory approval. Lives would be lost around the world. Americans might feel justifiably outraged for picking up this drug research tab for the rest of the world, but instead of putting price controls on our own drugs, the solution might be to get rid of government regulation in other countries.                
                

            
                A major issue currently is how costs have been changing over time. As the president said in his recent address to Congress, control over rising health care costs has been a major motivation for government provided insurance as well as for the many regulations to eliminate ""waste"" in health care. ""The only way I can get medium-and long-term federal spending under control is if we do something about health care. Ironically, health care reform is critical to deficit reduction,"" said Obama.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) collects data on health care expenditures for 30 countries. Take the last decade the data are available, from 1998 to 2007. During that time, per capita health care expenditures in the US rose on average by 7.2 percent per year. Expenditures for other countries actually rose on average by a percentage point more per year, 8.2 percent. Fourteen of the 24 countries beside the U.S. that had data over these years had a larger growth in health care spending that the U.S. A similar pattern occurs over the last twenty years.

For the average OECD country in 2007, government expenditures made up about 72 percent of all health care expenditures. At 45 percent, the U.S. is tied for the lowest share. Government spending made up more than 80 percent of health care spending in about a third of the countries. But making the US more like other countries and giving the government an even greater role doesn't seem to be the key to reducing costs. Indeed, the reverse is true -- countries where government has the highest share also faced the biggest increases in per capita expenditures. Using all the data available from 1960 to 2007 and accounting for per capita income as well as other factors, each one percent increase in a government's share of health care expenditures increases health care expenditures by about 0.4 percent.

But beyond the level of costs and how quickly they are increasing, there is another larger question: why should we really care? As we get wealthier, why should Americans avoid spending more on bigger houses or nicer cars or better health care? Why not be happy that we can now afford hip replacements in old age and diagnose cancer earlier? During many recent years Americans have spent even more money on housing than on health care, but, by itself, that doesn't show that too much money is spent on housing.

Ramming Health Care Through Congress Is About Obama Not Us,"Regarding health care, President Obama is telling us what we must do rather than selling us on it. This violates a good sales person’s first two principles: find out what your buyers want and when they want it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Mark Penn, a former pollster for both Bill and Hillary Clinton, confirms that in a recent column. Penn writes, “A February CNN poll puts voter support for the current bill (or a similar variant thereof) at just 25%. An equal percentage thinks Congress should forget health care reform altogether, while 48% think they should start work on an entirely new bill. Of more concern to any Democrat with an eye on re-election, independents remain unmoved by the arguments in reform's favor, with only 18% supporting it and 52% calling for an entirely new bill. The public's voice has been loud, clear and consistent. They say, fix the economy first. More than half (52%) name jobs or the economy as their top issue in a recent New York Times poll compared to 13% that name health care.”                
                

            
                As the president is fond of saying, “make no mistake” and make no mistake about this: Ramming health care reform  through  Congress is about empowering Obama—not us. According to Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who attended one of the meetings the president is holding to lobby lawmakers, Obama said, “To maintain a strong presidency, we need to pass the bill.”                
                

            
                What Obama is trying to impose (not sell) is the transformation of America into a welfare state organized around crushing debt, cradle-to-grave dependency, bureaucracy, and big government mandates and controls. If he succeeds, America risks losing its preference for individual freedoms, choices, limited government, and economic leadership.                
                

            
                Note that the president’s health care reform is a bait-and-switch maneuver -- where cuts to patients and doctors, special favors to special interests (like unions) and unsustainable spending and tax increases are either disguised in the short term or deferred to years when Obama would be re-elected or out of office.                
                

            
                As Andrew McCarthy has written, ""Health care is a loser for the Left only if the Right has the steel to undo it. The Left is banking on an absence of steel.” In other words, Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have suggested that even losing many Democratic seats in the 2010 elections is worth the Faustian bargain of winning a restructured, socialized America. As Mark Steyn says, “The short history of the postwar welfare state is that you don't need a president-for-life if you've got a bureaucracy-for-life.” Obama is betting that the Republicans won’t have the guts to dismantle his health care reform if it passes.
In telling rather than selling—by making any backroom deal, payoff, or using a parliamentary maneuver like reconciliation to force his health care reform bill through Congress—President Obama is banking on his steel to do it and our lack of steel to stop it.                
                

            
                The question is, will we buy that? Will we allow America to become a country where we do as we’re told rather than a country where we only do when we’re sold?

"If you want to see academics making fools of themselves, look at Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearings","The headline on the front page of the Washington Post sure sounded impressive: “More than 1,100 law school professors nationwide oppose Sessions’s nomination as attorney general.” Since then, the total has increased to 1,424 faculty members from 180 law schools in 49 different states.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                With Senate Judiciary committee getting ready to vote on Senator Jeff Sessions’ confirmation today, the letter is being used as Exhibit A for many liberals arguing that experts view Sessions as unqualified and outside the mainstream.                
                

            
                But with 17,080 faculty members nationwide, perhaps the real question is why there were so few signers. Only 8.3 percent of faculty members signed the letter.                
                

            
                Given that 82 percent of law professors identified themselves as Democrats in 2010, one can infer that only about 10 percent of Democrat professors signed the letter.                
                

            
                From 1991 to 2002, over 23 percent of law professors at the top 20 law schools contributed at least $200 exclusively or mostly to Democrats. By contrast, just 4 percent of law professors were active Republican donors. Assuming that over 23 percent figure has held true today (and given the inordinate hatred for Trump, this might be an underestimate), just a third of active donors to Democrats signed the letter.                
                

            
                The letter itself is written vaguely to maximize signatures. There is a regurgitation of charges made in 1986 that Sessions was “prejudice[d] against African Americans.” It continues: “Some of us have concerns about … his consistent promotion of the myth of voter-impersonation fraud ... his support for building a wall along our country’s southern border … his robust support for regressive drug policies that have fueled mass incarceration … his repeated opposition to legislative efforts to promote the rights of women and the members of the LGBTQ community.”                
                

            
                The faculty members could disagree with all of these points and still be able to sign the letter. Indeed, it is hard to find any other letter signed by academics (and there are a lot of them) that offers so many escape clauses for signers. But the goal was to get signatures, not to provide a coherent argument against Sessions.                
                

            
                The charges themselves are absurd.                
                

            
                Take their first claim. Only liberal academics would believe that “voter-impersonation fraud” is a myth.                
                

            
                A recent study in the peer-reviewed journal Electoral Studies estimated that illegal aliens cast about 1.4 million votes in the 2008 and 2010 elections, and that their votes “likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.”                
                

            
                Here are some cases of suspected impersonation fraud discovered during just the month-and-a-half prior to the November election:                
                

            
                • San Pedro, Calif.: 83 absentee ballots were sent to different registered voters who all supposedly lived in the same small, two-bedroom apartment. If not for an observant neighbor, this case would never have been discovered.                
                

            
                • Pennsylvania: Democrat organization FieldWorks LLC was raided by Pennsylvania State Police on allegations that it fraudulently filled out registration forms for thousands of voters.                
                

            
                • Indiana: State police “believe there could be hundreds of fraudulent voter registration records with different combinations of made up names and addresses with people’s real information.“                
                

            
                • Chicago: An investigation by CBS-2 found that “119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade.”                
                

            
                • Virginia: After examining just eight of the state’s 133 counties, 1,046 illegal aliens were discovered to already be registered voters.                
                

            
                • New York City: In an undercover video, Democrats themselves were caught complaining about the amount of voter fraud created by Mayor Bill de Blasio’s decision to give out ID cards without checking recipients’ identities.                
                

            
                The law professors’ second claim doesn’t cite any specific concerns about the wall along the Mexican border. So there is nothing to respond to.                
                

            
                Their third claim blames drug crimes for mass incarceration. But in 2012, only 20 percent of inmates at state and federal prisons were incarcerated for possessing or trafficking any type of illegal drugs — and those sentences were primarily for trafficking hard drugs. Data from Arizona indicate that as few as 0.3 percent of inmates were incarcerated for marijuana possession, and these are rare individuals who have been arrested multiple times. In California, only 1 percent of state prisoners are incarcerated for any type of marijuana-related offense.                
                

            
                The fourth claim doesn’t mention any specific things that Sessions has done to harm women or others.  But presumably it focuses what was raised during the hearings, Sessions’ vote against the Violence Against Women Act.  But neither law professors nor his opponents during the hearings over the last two days have seriously addressed Sessions explanation for his vote.  Sessions had previously supported the Act, but opposed its renewal in 2012 over concerns that it was unconstitutional when changes were made expanding Indian tribes’ jurisdiction over non-tribal members.  Tribal courts also have a history of failing to provide adequate legal protections to defendants.  No evidence was ever provided that prosecuting non-tribal members in US courts posed any problems to protecting Indians.                
                

            
                Academics keep making fools of themselves with letters like this, which have everything to do with not wanting a Republican attorney general who supports policies they disagree with. Their letter has nothing to do with Sessions’ ability to uphold the law in good faith.

Thanksgiving: The Great American Brand,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                It is the one holiday that is most truly and powerfully ours as a nation.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                July 4th, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Veteran’s Day –these are all important holidays— but there is nothing quite as American as Thanksgiving Day.                
                

            
                At times, unfortunately, I think we can lose sight of the very essence of Thanksgiving.                
                

            
                Thanksgiving is not simply about giving thanks for what we have. It is about giving thanks for a country that has enabled us to earn what we have, keep what we have earned and live the way we live because of its great and enduring foundational strengths. These foundational strengths include our constitution, and our commitment to property rights and the rule of law. They include the respect for the individual citizen. These might seem like core American features, but it was never inevitable that we would have managed to keep them for 200 plus years.                
                

            
                Bottom line: Thanksgiving is about giving thanks for the reality of America and the fact that year after year for more than two centuries, we as a people have been able to depend on this country as a peaceful and promising place.                
                

            
                Lincoln seemed to have this in mind when in the middle of the Civil War he invited the nation to set aside a day to give thanks (it wouldn’t become a Federal holiday until 1941).                
                

            
                The Civil War might seem a strange time to give thanks, but not if you are giving thanks for the very strengths that assured Lincoln that this country would endure past the tragedy and that its best days still lay ahead. Here’s part of what he wrote:                
                

            
                In the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign States to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere except in the theatre of military conflict…                
                

            
                Let’s face it. Gratitude is a kind of discipline. It requires perceiving the good by recognizing all that could have gone wrong, all that you should never take for granted. To be grateful is to make a positive choice.                
                

            
                In Lincoln’s invitation to give thanks, he made the point that as bad as things obviously were, the important things like order, the law and a peaceable society had been maintained and liberty, the lifeblood of our nation, had not been disrupted. These are no small things, but he knew that we could easily overlook them if we didn’t make the positive choice to see them and to celebrate them.                
                

            
                Recently a 1795 reeded-edge United States penny was sold for $1.3 million dollars at auction. Across the top of the penny the words “Liberty” are written. What other country’s citizens can look back over the past 200 plus years and identify with the ideal of liberty and know that the promise of liberty has remained uninterrupted? -- No European can. No Asian can. No African can. No South American or Central American can. -- But an American can.                
                

            
                With all the talk of other nations eclipsing America with their rapid growth (i.e., China) or dynamic social policies (i.e., universal health care reform), it is easy to forget that these nations simply don’t have the incredible track record of stability, justice and just plain domestic peace that we do.

Every one of those countries has suffered horrible upheavals in their not-so-distant past in which members of their societies lost property and lost their lives because of tyranny. But if you lost your bounty in America in the last two hundred years, you couldn’t blame a corrupt state, a dictator or a communist ideology, it was almost always your own fault.                
                

            
                An interview with this year’s New York City marathon winner, Meb Keflizighi, in The Wall Street Journal drives this point home. You may remember that he is the man who one commentator originally said wasn’t really American. Well, if he isn’t American, I don’t know who qualifies. His family fled an Eritrean village and he arrived in America as a child where his dad worked many jobs and made sure the children learned English. It was here that he became a champion runner after a junior high school coach identified his great talent. He credits America’s opportunity and it’s stability for giving him the chance to focus and discipline his energies on becoming great. Here’s what he told The Journal:                
                

            
                You start on the bottom, work hard, and your dreams will come true—and that's what happened. We have a very successful family because my parents always emphasized using the opportunity you have to the maximum: 'There are a lot of people that don't have this opportunity, so make sure you use it.' That stuck in our head.                
                

            
                The opportunity that Meb is talking about wasn’t his family’s opportunity because of how good and talented they were, it was the opportunity that America itself affords anyone who is here.                 
                

            
                Meb and his family saw it clearly because they only knew too well what opportunity doesn’t look like. And when you know what opportunity doesn’t look like and then find it, you “make sure you use it.”                
                

            
                Our American uniqueness and this opportunity should never be a reason to become complacent as a nation, but it should be a reason to celebrate and above all be thankful.                
                

            
                Happy Thanksgiving!

Michelle to the Rescue?,"When it comes to selling health care, it's a family affair. As one Obama struggles to sell his plan to the broader public, it appears the White House is hopeful they can enlist another Obama to help close the deal.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                According to Politico: First lady Michelle Obama “plans a packed autumn that aides say will include a ‘dedicated focus’ on health insurance reform”.                
                

            
                Up until today, we’ve heard little from the first lady when it comes to hot button issues. They’ve covered her gardening, gabbing with kids, and walking along side her husband to and from Marine One.                
                

            
                Like every first lady, she chose an issue that she wanted to champion during her husband’s tenure. For Michelle Obama, it was military families, a noble and paramount concern. Now, the Obamas plan to tag team the country making healthcare priority number one.                
                

            
                If history is any indication, a president’s wife might not be the best salesperson. Remember what happened the last time a President enlisted his wife to sell healthcare? Hillary Clinton found herself in a national battle, further complicating the issue for Congress, for her husband, and for herself.                
                

            
                Though CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante reports that, “unlike Hillary Clinton who spearheaded the Clinton administration's early health care effort, first lady Michelle Obama will have a very different role in the president's non-stop effort to sell health care reform,” the move still remains dangerous. Sending a popular First Lady into a polarizing debate that is already turned against your favor is a gamble. Especially when that lady wasn’t always so popular.                
                

            
                Before we celebrated her bare arms and J Crew shift dresses, Michelle Obama has had a rocky relationship with the American people. During the campaign, Michelle was often considered a liability for her husband. She was stereotyped as “angry,” called a “militant black woman” on some blogs and most controversially, was caught in the crosshairs over comments about being proud of her country for the first time. Many joked she wore the pants in the relationship, and speculated that she harbored racist feelings toward whites.                
                

            
                Obama worked hard to reform that image. She stayed mostly behind the scenes, insisting she was focused on raising her daughters, not elbowing her way into Oval Office policy making. And it worked. In March 2008, her positive rating was only 32 percent, according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Now, the first lady boasts an approval rating of 70 percent, much higher than her husband’s.                
                

            
                Dissaproval for the president's healthcare plan is at an all time low. By thrusting her into the most divisive debate the country has had since the Iraq War, The Administration faces a host of risks.
First, they’ll expend the precious political capital that the First Lady has earned from a majority of the American people. If this strategy fails, the Administration risks having two unpopular Obamas at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. They may think she’s their secret weapon, but that weapon could be better used in 2010 and 2012.                
                

            
                Injecting Obama at this stage in the game could also throw gasoline on the race debate. Many on the left have accused anyone who opposes the President of harboring racist feelings. If they oppose both Obamas, will this further fuel the fire?                
                

            
                Society is generally tougher on females in the public eye than males. If Obama's advisers aren't careful, Michelle Obama could return to her lightning rod status and end up being a liability, not an asset, for her husband. She should stick to her original mission: military families, ribbon cuttings, recipes, and People magazine interviews. Helping the families of those on the front line is one thing, helping your president-husband on the front lines is another.

DANA PERINO: Watch How the Media Spins Obama's Speech,"Here we go again. Another day, another speech on health care.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Will this one be any different? By all indications the answer is no, at least not dramatically so-- even though the speech is to a Joint Session of Congress. So how's a reporter supposed to write something new when there's really nothing new being said?                
                

            
                Well, watch how the media walks its walk on health care coverage in the next couple of days. Many reporters seem just about bored to tears with the policy details. Now they are in full-throated ""who's up"" and ""who's down"" political coverage. Unfortunately, most Americans still aren't satisfied with the policy proposals and are strongly rejecting the Democrats' plans for a government takeover of the health care system that they believe will hurt them, their families and their country.                
                

            
                Lost in the coverage is discussion of what Republicans have been trying to get the media to pay attention to. In general, the media has not given much coverage to the their well thought-out, common sense ideas for health care reform. Yes, the solutions are a bit complex, but so are the problems. It's easier to duck the substance and instead take a shortcut by saying the Republicans have no plan of their own and that they're just a bunch of naysayers.                
                

            
                To give them the benefit of the doubt, perhaps one of the problems is that reporters are overstretched trying to cover too many issues without enough resources. But it's also just as possible that many in the media just don't agree with market-based reforms that don't get to a government-run health care system and therefore elegant ideas such as allowing the sale of insurance across state lines, equalizing the tax system so that individuals and entrepeneurs are on the same playing field with big businesses and unions, and addressing the pressing need for medical malpractice reform just aren't that interesting to reporters. I'm not sayin'....I'm just sayin'.                
                

            
                The media is itching to write a comeback story after what was, by all accounts, a rotten summer for the Democrats. They'll want to say that the president has ""found his voice,"" ""reclaimed the issue,"" ""reenergized the debate"". To do that, they need to set up the piece with a contrast, even if it isn't true.                
                

            
                For example, The Washington Post this morning says that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is pivoting from his ""just say no"" strategy on health care reform. This is elementary-- good grief! The Senator has given 30 floor speeches since June on the topic and has given countless interviews -- and in every single one of them he outlines what the Republicans support.                
                

            
                I've seen this before-- even when you haven't changed your strategy sometimes the media will *say* that you have just because it fits their storyline better and gives them a political angle to write about.                
                

            
                Republicans are the minority party and they have an obligation to oppose policies when they think those policies aren't good ones. It's the Democrats that have shifted strategies so many times that now it seems like they are all the way back to square one.                
                

            
                I go by this rule: good policy is good politics. At this point, the Republicans have the better policy ideas and, therefore, the better political forecast. Perhaps we'll read that in tomorrow morning's papers...right?

The Senate's Health Care Bill Isn't On My Christmas List,"These days, the status and the support for the Senate health care bill seems to change by the hour. Over the weekend, Senator Joseph Lieberman said he couldn’t support the bill in its current form because of the expansion of Medicare through the buy-in compromise and the public option. And this week, amid much pressure and media attention, he’s sticking to his guns.

With other moderate Democrats vacillating on their votes as poll numbers continue to slip for support of this bill to all-time lows, can Harry Reid and Senate Democrats get this done by the arbitrary timeline of Christmas?

It’s likely something will get done, but questions about who, what, when and how still remain. Right now Senate Democrats are struggling to find the 60 votes they need to block a filibuster from Republicans who say the Democrat's proposed health care plan is too expensive and too bureaucratic--ironically, the main reasons Democrats argued we needed this plan in the first place.

What's the rush?

Senate Majority Leader Reid and his counterparts need to pass this bill because the longer they wait, the more likely its chances of dying on the vine become plausible. Plus, the American people want to see Washington focused on jobs -- not health care. The longer they spend talking about this (and it's been a while), the more disillusioned Democrats will look, and the more frustrated the voters will get (here’s the kicker) in an ELECTION year.

Moderates like Ben Nelson, Mary Landrieu, Blanche Lincoln and Lieberman might not be Reid's only problem. In a shocking twist, liberals are hearing the pragmatic opposition make threats and some are now suddenly starting to sing off the same sheet music as Republicans in a push to scrap the entire thing. It’s looking like some liberal Democrats might defect if the bill becomes watered down and stripped of its most questionable portions.

According to Greg Sargent of The Plum Line Blog, Howard Dean, de-facto leader of the progressive movement, in an interview ""said the removal of the Medicare buy-in made the bill not worth supporting, and urged Dem leaders to start over with the process of reconciliation in the interview.""

For the first time, I actually agree with Dean!

In the words of Dean, himself: “Yeeeeooooow!”

If liberals like Howard Dean and Obama-replacement Illinois Senator Roland Burris are poised to bail on a bill without a public option, how can Reid herd these cats?

To their credit, Republicans are fighting back, and hard. They are smartly messaging this as Democrats wanting to do this for themselves and Obama for his own lasting legacy.

On ""60 Minutes"" this past Sunday, Obama noted that though many have tried to pass health reform in his party, they’ve all failed, but that he would be the one to get it done.

Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell spelled it out perfectly on Tuesday:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                “The supporters of this bill seem to think this is about them, about their legacies. This isn’t about them. This is about the American people. This is not about making history. This about doing the right thing for ever single American’s health care. And Americans have a message: Higher premiums, higher taxes, and higher health care costs are not what they signed up for. This is not what they were promised. This is not reform. Yes: Doing nothing is not an option. But making current problems worse is worse.”                
                

            
                Stay tuned. The standoff on health care reform is taking place right before our eyes. More and more, it’s looking like the gift that the left wants to give the American people for Christmas – the one that most of us don’t want – won’t end up under the tree. Sounds like a Merry Christmas to me.

Hospital crisis needs a healthy dose of faith,"My home state of Georgia is in the throes of a health care crisis.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Providers are cutting hours, hospitals are closing their doors, and Georgians -- black, white, brown, purple, rich and poor -- are suffering. Five hospitals have been shuttered in the past three years, and many more have reduced the services they provide.                
                

            
                As a minister and a concerned community member, I cannot stand by and idly watch this situation worsen. The Bible teaches that we have a moral responsibility to care for the most vulnerable among us. Proverbs 21:13 states, “He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also cry himself and not be answered.” Their suffering is our suffering. But as we seek to face the reality of our daily challenges to keep health care accessible in Georgia, we must keep Washington from making the situation worse.                
                

            
                Hospitals, clinics and other treatment centers have to navigate myriad regulations handed down from federal and state statutes. More have been piled on since the passage of health care reform.                
                

            
                Today, a successful program that was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 to benefit critical access hospitals in poor rural and urban areas has become a congressional target -- the 340B program. The 340B program requires that pharmaceutical companies sell their outpatient drugs to safety-net hospitals at discounted prices. In return, they are able to participate in the federal Medicaid program and have access to many millions of guaranteed customers.                
                

            
                Scripture is clear on our moral obligation to help those in need, but history has taught us that depending on Washington for solutions is often a fool’s errand. Finally, in the 340B program, we’ve found something that works -- a revenue-neutral program that benefits safety-net hospitals serving low-income areas, often with large aging, minority, or infant populations, without costing taxpayers money.                
                

            
                It’s important that Congress leave this program alone, especially given the numerous other health care issues that demand immediate attention.                
                

            
                Georgia isn’t unique in its mounting hospital closures. Nationwide, 43 rural hospitals have closed since 2010. Inner-city hospitals have faced similar pressures, and experienced similar results. These hospitals and clinics are often major employers in their communities, as well as the last line of defense for life-saving treatments. As they scramble to keep their doors open, many have come to increasingly rely on the 340B program. Congressional cuts to the number of providers eligible to benefit from the program would be a mistake.                
                

            
                The mayor of Belhaven, N.C., walked the nearly 300 miles to Washington, D.C., last week to raise awareness for the plight of rural hospitals after his local hospital closed in 2014. With him was the Rev. William Barber, head of the North Carolina NAACP, an outspoken advocate for health care for low-income and minority populations.                
                

            
                While Rev. Barber and I differ in some of our views, we’re united by our faith and by a common background. Of course we likely agree that health affirming and health improving programs are needed. The health and livelihood of the unborn, mothers and women in general must be of the highest value in our society.                
                

            
                We also share a set of challenges that demand real world solutions while reducing the taxpayer burden, as the cost for government programs becomes too great for working Americans to bear.                
                

            
                My uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said in 1964 that poverty “is one of the most urgent items on the agenda of modern life.” It’s as true today, unfortunately, as it was then. We must recognize effectiveness when we see it, cost-savings when we can, and moral responsibility at all times.                
                

            
                Anything less is both fiscally irresponsible and morally reprehensible."
"America Beware, It's Deja Vu All Over Again In Congress","As Yogi Berra might say, it’s déjà vu all over again in Washington. As happened with health care, Democrats are about to sic government bureaucrats on a huge chunk of the American economy—this time the banking and financial sectors.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Comprehensive new regulations have passed the House and after the July Fourth break will go back to the Senate, where the bill currently lacks enough bipartisan support to pass.                 
                

            
                But, as with health care reform, count on Democrats succeeding with the legislation. They are cutting complicated accounting deals to win the support of a few pliable Republicans. And, as with health care, consumers will ultimately take a hit, as new premiums on banks cause an increase in fees for services such as checking accounts.                
                

            
                Finally, as with health care, the overhaul will be a victory for President Obama’s big government agenda and a defeat for effective reform. Consider the red flags.                
                

            
                In a disturbing echo of what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said about Obamacare (“We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it”), Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) said of the proposed new financial regulations, ""No one will know until this is actually in place how it works.”                
                

            
                According to The Washington Post, the “far-reaching new financial rules” would create “A new consumer protection bureau housed in the Federal Reserve [that] would have independent funding, an independent leader and near-total autonomy to write and enforce rules.                 
                

            
                The government would have broad new powers to seize and wind down large, failing financial firms and to oversee the $600 trillion derivatives market. In addition, a council of regulators, headed by the Treasury secretary, would monitor the financial landscape for potential systemic risks.”                
                

            
                Will that be effective? You be the judge. The fathers of the legislation are Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.                 
                

            
                This troublesome twosome stoked subprime mortgage abuses by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that contributed to the near crash of the country’s financial system in September of 2008. Putting Dodd and Frank in charge of financial regulation, abetted by Pelosi, is like putting Willie Sutton along with Bonnie and Clyde in charge of bank reform.                
                

            
                By institutionalizing government intervention with large financial institutions that mismanage their way to near bankruptcy, the proposed new regulations perpetuate “too big to fail” government bailouts.                 
                

            
                The new regulations’ weak rules on proprietary and derivatives trading provide bank lobbyists with wiggle room to repeat past excesses. Even worse, the legislation doesn’t revamp Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. It doesn’t end their unlimited credit line from the government. The losses from these two government-sponsored lenders have already cost taxpayers $145-billion and their red ink keeps flowing.                
                

            
                Like health care reform, the new financial regulations give government regulators wide policing discretion to catch abusers and set limits on free market activities.                 
                

            
                But the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies were deaf, dumb and blind to Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and to the American International Group (AIG), whose government “rescue” has already cost taxpayers $130-billion, and counting.                 
                

            
                Federal “gumshoes” also failed to detect or deter a number of Wall Street and Main Street banks that bent the risk curve on lending and investing before the 2008 meltdown. Is it reasonable to believe that government bureaucrats that have acted like Keystone Cops for years will suddenly act with Sherlock Holmes-like investigatory brilliance in the future?                
                

            
                With déjà vu predictability, the new financial regulations are also rife with counterproductive consequences. For example, the clampdowns on derivatives will send bank business (and U.S. jobs) to foreign markets like Asia. New rules on bank reserves will limit lending to consumers and businesses. Expect interest rates on home, car and business loans to rise.                 
                

            
                And new empowerment of government bureaucrats even caused The New York Times to comment that, “Requiring banks to provide reams of additional data will create jobs for lawyers and analysts, but will it produce better results?”                
                

            
                As with Obamacare, the devil is in the details of executing the reforms. There is much room for devilish overreach and mismanagement by government when we have yet another 2,000-page bill that gives bureaucrats ill-defined but sweeping authority (and is thus “too big to fail”).                 
                

            
                But Democrats are hell-bent on handing Obama another trophy law that touts his government control agenda abroad and at home, well before November’s mid-term elections.                
                

            
                However, in an Associated Press poll last week, 64% of Americans said they doubt that the new financial regulations will prevent a future financial meltdown. Americans are skeptical of the premise behind all of Obama’s initiatives: “Trust me, I’m from the government and I’m here to help you.”                
                

            
                A refrain from a Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young song called ""Déjà Vu"" says it best: “We have all been here before.”

Obama's Sorry State of the Union Speech,"At roughly 9:48pm EST, in the midst of President Obama's first State of the Union address he begged us to ""let him know!""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The president was defending his push for his vision of universal health care when he threw down the challenge in a speech that seemed strangely and wholly disconnected from the experience of the average American family.                
                

            
                As far as expectations for the State of the Union the president's speech was a sizable failure.                
                

            
                By my count President Obama made several significant policy pivots -- for the first time he advocated the use of nuclear power, domestic drilling, clean coal, capital gains tax cuts, spending freezes, and called on Congress to ""tighten their belts"" just as American families are being forced to do.                
                

            
                Acting on previously published advice from Democratic strategist James Carville, President Obama took the opportunity, by my count at least eight times, to mention Bush administration. He did this not to give President Bush and his team credit for the low unemployment we enjoyed during his eight years in office, or the national security they provided. Instead, he brought up the Bush administration to place blame for the problems that have only grown since President Obama entered the White House.                
                

            
                He gave lip service to the need to create new jobs. Yet, in almost the same breath, he claimed he had rescued the economy in 2009. He claimed to have saved 2 million jobs with the stimulus bill (though the Congressional Budget office does not endorse his numbers or view his on the matter the way he implied it does in his speech.) But the number of jobs lost on his watch exceeds 3 million.                
                

            
                Most shocking of all, perhaps, was his insistence on ramming health care reform and cap-and-trade legislation down the throats of American voters even though they have roundly rejected his proposals on these issues.                
                

            
                He referred to himself in the speech more than 100 times. And made absolutely absurd demands that appeared to be almost dishonest. But noticeably absent in his speech was any mention of how he handled the mirandizing of a terrorist captured after a failed terror attack on Christmas Day. -- The fourth such attack on our nation in just his first year in office.                
                

            
                He also made several statements that were painfully obvious, from noting that, ""jobs must be our number one focus in 2010"" to ""the true engine of jobs creation is our nation's businesses.""                
                

            
                He also drew laughter at himself with one liners, ""For those who have yet to believe the overwhelming scientific evidence that exists on climate change"" to the line ""all of this before I walked in the door.""                
                

            
                President Obama's State of the Union address was poorly thought out, not terribly well executed, and, in the end, tremendously ineffective.                
                

            
                It was also terribly inappropriate when he openly encouraged belligerent reaction against the Supreme Court with the Justices sitting in the chamber. It was a cheap shot, and multiple constitutionalists and scholars believe it may have violated the spirit embodied in our government’s commitment to the separation of powers.                
                

            
                Add to this stemwinder of a speech that he will work towards an unhealthy and unsafe environment for homosexuals in our nation's military ranks.                
                

            
                He closed the sale by announcing yet another deadline for terrorists in Iraq to bide their time for, specifically August of 2010.                
                

            
                It was messy, incoherent, disorganized, and most regrettably defiant.                
                

            
                Which I guess when you think of it, defines the state of our union pretty well.

              Great news! Hillary Clinton has finally figured out What Happened! It wasn’t, after all, James Comey or racism or Vladimir Putin or sexism or the hostile media that torpedoed her bid for the White House. Instead, it was…(drumroll please…) millions of Stepford wives, voting the way their husbands told them to.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In her insatiable thirst for redemption Hillary casts an ever-wider net, trying to scoop up those responsible for her defeat. Speaking in India recently, she again revisited her stinging 2016 election loss, this time hauling in white women, who vote the way “your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              What an offense to the millions of women who didn’t trust Hillary, didn’t like Hillary, and didn’t think she had earned the right to be our first female president.  And what an embarrassment to her party, some of whom have disavowed her comments. Senator Claire McCaskill, for instance, who is battling to be reelected in red state Missouri, criticized Hillary’s remarks; nonetheless, the Republican opponent hoping to dislodge McCaskill wasted no time tying her to Clinton, whom she previously had endorsed.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Republicans hope Hillary will hang around, reminding Trump voters how delighted they are that she isn’t president. More and more Democrats would like her to disappear Stage Left, for good.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to one survey, 61 percent of white women without a college degree voted for Donald Trump as did 45 percent of white women who graduated from college.  Did all those tens of millions of females simply do as they were told by the men in their lives? Please, women are not that compliant or that stupid.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The irony is, of course, that Hillary would never have been a candidate for president but for the men in her life. It was husband Bill who pushed her forward from the start and, against all odds, became a beloved leader of the Democratic Party. And she would never have come close to cracking the glass ceiling but for the dogged efforts of President Obama, who saw her as willing to carry on his legacy.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Democrats who put gender ahead of the economy, or jobs, or national security, or who think that their dogmatic positions on abortion or equal pay are the only key to winning elections, are insulting women. 
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              Remember, she was such a terrible candidate that she almost lost the Democratic primary battle to a septuagenarian Socialist who had been in Congress for 24 years and never passed a significant piece of legislation. And that was with the DNC not only rallying behind her but cheating on her behalf as well.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It was Bill who put Hillary on the national stage in 1992, breaking with long-standing convention to give his wife a policy role early in his administration. That she immediately flamed out after trying to craft a health care reform program, offending allies and opponents alike by running roughshod over them, should have raised red flags about her political IQ.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It was Bill who begrudgingly campaigned for her victorious rival Barack Obama in 2008, presumably in exchange for some guarantee that Hillary would win the latter’s backing when her turn came. And it was Bill who lent her his popularity and who pushed her to address disaffected white, working-class voters during the campaign -- advice which she ignored.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The insulting remarks in India were not Hillary’s first broadside against her own gender. During Bill’s first run for president, she explained that she had chosen the unusual path of working while he was governor by saying “I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas.” Though Hillary tried to walk the sarcasm back, women not in the workplace knew they had been dissed.   
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Hillary is not the only liberal who blames white women for her defeat.  Michelle Obama also railed about how women were, well, wrong to vote for Donald Trump. In a speech in Boston, the former First Lady said, “As far as I'm concerned, any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice in a way.” Like Hillary, Michelle thinks women were simply following orders: “Well, to me that just says you don’t like your voice. You like the thing we’re told to like.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Told to like? How about, saw the big picture?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For voters overall, and for women, the economy and terrorism were the top issues in 2016. Hillary flunked on both counts. She promised to continue the economic policies of her boss Barack Obama, who produced the most lackluster recovery in the country’s history. Not only did she propose raising taxes on businesses and the wealthy – though she surely knew such measures would prove harmful to growth – she also came out against what she disparaged as the “gig” economy. This, as Millennials and women, in particular, applaud the flexibility that comes with jobs provided by new start-ups and technological innovation.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              On terrorism, Hillary was on more solid ground, since even she had criticized Obama for lacking a robust foreign policy. As she said, “""Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don’t do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle."" Unfortunately for Hillary, she made those remarks in 2014. By the time the election was in full swing, she had attached herself to Obama’s coattails as firmly as a face is planted on Mt.

              Democrats who put gender ahead of the economy, or jobs, or national security, or who think that their dogmatic positions on abortion or equal pay are the only key to winning elections, are insulting women. Many men and women understand that providing policies that unleash the growth of the economy is essential to the ambitions of our nation. Bolstering our entitlements programs, funding health care for the needy, improving our education system and strengthening our military all require revenues that will only come from an expanding economy.

Opinion: What Democrats are doing is not enough,"Democratic presidential candidates take the stage before the CNN debate Tuesday, Oct. 13, 2015, in Las Vegas.

                Five minutes. Democrats running for president of the United States had a total of five minutes – from a 120 minute hour debate – to win over immigrants, and they largely fell short. As an undocumented Latino with several citizen relatives, this is not enough for my family.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                According to the Center for American Progress’ 2012 report, there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and 16.6 million families who have at least one undocumented member.                 
                

            
                On the right, poll numbers spike whenever Donald Trump or any GOP candidate takes an anti-immigrant stance. But the GOP's xenophobia is still less shameful than the Democrat candidates’ reluctance to support a far ranging pro-immigrant platform.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Secretary Clinton can’t be, and isn’t, for our community while denying health care to our parents and deporting our kids.

                Secretary Hillary Clinton, the current front-runner and presumed nominee, is the most culpable of this inaction. She promoted a policy to restrict immigrant access to health care and a college education. She failed to lean in when CNN host Anderson Cooper brought up her unfavorable positions, denying federal subsidies for undocumented immigrants in the Affordable Care Act Exchange and deferring to states’ discretion on the issue of in-state tuition for undocumented students.                 
                

            
                When given an opportunity, she displayed a lack of leadership for Latinos and the larger immigrant populations affected by our broken immigration system including thousands of immigrants from Asia and Africa.

                As chair of Task Force on National Health Care Reform, Hillary Clinton once argued that all Americans deserve health care. It’s disappointing she now believes immigrants don’t deserve affordable and quality health care.                 
                

            
                At a town hall in Nevada this summer, Secretary Clinton argued that all children should have “the best chance to do well in school.” We expected continued leadership on our education, not a cop-out to states’ rights when it comes to college.                 
                

            
                Hillary’s current position on in-state tuition is similar to what she said about gay marriage as recently as 2006, in which she claimed it should be up to the states, before doing a further flop as presidential candidate to fully support it.                 
                

            
                Keep in mind this is also the same Secretary Clinton that advocated for the mass deportation of unaccompanied minors from Central America, despite legal groups saying virtually all of them would be eligible for some form of humanitarian relief.                 
                

            
                Secretary Clinton can’t be, and isn’t, for our community while denying health care to our parents and deporting our kids.                
                

            
                The rest of the candidates had an opportunity to distinguish themselves but largely failed to capitalize it. Senator Webb himself lost a good opportunity by bringing up the border without addressing the needless deaths and rampant misconduct by Border Patrol.                 
                

            
                Senator Sanders, considered the most ""left"" by many, was relegated to defending his 2007 vote against immigration reform. If he were truly passionate on this issue, then he would have turned it around and explained what specific executive actions he would take as president, such as expanding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, promoting in-state tuition for all states, and expanding Affordable Care Act coverage to all regardless of citizenship status.                 
                

            
                Governor O’Malley was the only standout, as he recounted passing the Maryland Dream Act and forcefully made a case for expanding the Affordable Care Act to include undocumented immigrants not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because it makes economic sense for health insurance rates.                
                

            
                This contest is still in its early stages but candidates, and the Democratic Party itself, are still not doing enough. We remember the failure of the DREAM Act in 2010, the millions of deportations under President Obama, and see the campaign money candidates are receiving from private detention centers.                 
                

            
                It’s no longer enough to be left of Republicans — now it’s time to lead.

The Reconciliation Rulebook,"Even as President Obama prepares to convene a televised summit on health care reform designed to showcase his newfound commitment to “bipartisanship,” the White House and congressional Democrats have been finalizing their plans to ram through a health care bill using a little-known and seldom-used parliamentary gimmick known as “reconciliation.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                For those not versed in the arcane rules of the U.S. Senate, reconciliation is not what a divorced couple attempts when they visit Dr. Phil. It is a mechanism for avoiding filibusters on certain budgetary issues. If Democrats can find a way to apply it to health care reform, they could pass a bill with just 51 votes, negating the election of Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown and the loss of the 60-seat supermajority.                
                

            
                Reconciliation was established in 1974 to make it easier for Congress to adjust taxes and spending in order to “reconcile” actual revenues and expenditures with a previously approved budget resolution. Thus, at the end of the year, if Congress found that it was running a budget deficit higher than previously projected, it could quickly raise taxes or cut spending to bring the budget back into line. Debate on such measures was abbreviated to just 20 hours (an eyeblink in Senate terms), and there could be no filibuster.                
                

            
                As Robert Byrd, (D-W.V.), one of the original authors of the reconciliation rule, explained, “Reconciliation was intended to adjust revenue and spending levels in order to reduce deficits...it was not designed to…restructure the entire health care system.” He warns that using reconciliation for health care would “violate the intent and spirit of the budget process, and do serious injury to the Constitutional role of the Senate.” In fact, in 1985, the Senate adopted the “Byrd rule,” which prohibits the use of reconciliation for any “extraneous issue” that does not directly change revenues or expenditures. Clearly, large portions of the health care bill, ranging from mandates to insurance regulation to establishing “exchanges,” do not meet that requirement.

With Republicans threatening to challenge any provision that violates the Byrd Rule, Democrats have been contemplating a variety of ways around it, including having Vice President Joe Biden, in his role as president of the Senate, overrule the nonpartisan Senate parliamentarian. But no vice president has overruled a parliamentarian since Nelson Rockefeller in 1976, and doing so now, in defense of a bill opposed by 58 percent of voters, risks a significant backlash.                
                

            
                Given the difficulties, therefore, no one expects the Democrats to try to pass a whole new bill. Instead, the House of Representatives would pass the already approved Senate health care bill without any changes. However, because the Senate bill is unacceptable to both liberal and moderate House members, they would simultaneously pass a separate bill under reconciliation procedures that would make changes demanded by the House. Theoretically, those changes would be less likely to run afoul of the Byrd rule and would therefore need just 51 votes to pass.                
                

            
                But this approach is problematic too. Some changes demanded by the House, such as exempting union workers from the 40 percent excise tax on “Cadillac” insurance plans, would likely pass the Byrd Rule test. Others, like abortion restrictions or ending the anti-trust exemption for insurance companies, would not.                
                

            
                There are other procedural hurdles as well. For example, any legislation passed under reconciliation cannot increase budget deficits by even one cent between 2010 and 2014.                 
                

            
                Moreover, it cannot increase deficits by more than $1 billion beyond 2014—not just overall, but in any single year. Nor can it increase deficits by more than $5 billion over any 10-year period. That is a very hard standard to meet. Indeed, that is why the Bush tax cuts expire.                
                

            
                Reconciliation also cannot impose unfunded mandates on states or businesses in excess of $69 million for states or $139 million for business. The Congressional Budget Office has already noted that health care reform exceeds those ceilings, and expanding Medicaid eligibility or extending the mandate for employers to provide insurance to their workers is another likely dealbreaker.                
                

            
                This puts House Democrats in a real bind. Without a guarantee that the changes they want would actually pass the Senate, would House members really pass a deeply unpopular bill that many of them hate? And would the Senate be willing to defy public sentiment by blatantly abusing the reconciliation procedure?                
                

            
                This all seems to depend on how determined—or desperate—this administration is.

A Jump Ball for Democrats and Republicans In 2010,"In Election Year 2010, three classic political sentiments will compete to determine winners and losers: “Had Enough,” “Stay the Course,” and “Give Me That.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                “Had Enough” is in ascendancy now. Polls indicate that Americans have “had enough” in several areas, including: intelligence failures in airline (and national) security, legalistic coddling of terrorists, the “stimulus” that has stimulated unemployment, special interest bailouts and never ending debt, and elected officials who arrogantly say the hell with public opinion.                
                

            
                “Had Enough” pressure about the “underwear bomber” has President Obama suddenly scrambling to show responsiveness to public outrage even as he defies public concerns about health care reform, where he insists that his “Stay the Course” commitment will overcome all red flags.                
                

            
                He’s also asking for “Stay the Course” forbearance on other of his strategies such as: Afghanistan and the wider war against terrorists, dealing with nuclear threats from Iran, North Korea and other rogue regimes, government intervention or outright takeovers of wide swaths of the economy. Also, President Obama is focused on finding salvation for our nation through massive spending on behalf of his “green” and “climate change” priorities. And finally, he wants to see a general restructuring of America to make it look more like Europe when it comes to entitlements, wealth redistribution, taxation, powerful state employees and unions, indulgence of illegal immigrants and preference of global governance over national sovereignty.                
                

            
                Meantime, top Democrats who announced this week that they will not seek reelection are capitulating to “Had Enough” animus rather than “Stay the Course.” Why? Because they knew that if the asked voters to send them back to Washington or the governor's mansion they risked getting badly beaten up politically. They will slink off to a future as lawyers, lobbyists, university presidents and other pursuits to remain in the public eye while they grow rich and agitate for their pet causes.                
                

            
                “Give Me That” is where the political opportunities are in 2010. Voters are cynical about mere calls for “change.” They want clearly defined alternative solutions from candidates who are credible, likeable and willing to stand up for their core beliefs. At the local, state and national levels, Americans are searching for leaders whom they can support without holding their noses and voting for the lesser evil but by saying, “Give Me That!”                
                

            
                From our basketball-loving president comes a metaphor for how this will all play out, politically, in 2010. Right now, for Democrats, Republicans, and emerging third party alternatives like the Tea Party movement, it’s a jump ball.

                People are finding their plans are not as cheap as a cell phone bill.                 
                

            
                Their family’s doctors may not even be covered by their new insurance.                
                

            
                President Obama should admit to the American people that his law doesn’t provide the affordable, accessible health care coverage that they wanted all along. Then he should come to the table with Republicans to give people the real health care reform that they need, that they want, and that they deserve.                
                

            
                As we all remember, President Obama also promised repeatedly that if you liked the insurance you had, you could keep it. It turns out that only if the White House likes your plan can you keep it – if not, you’re out of luck. In fact, the Administration knew for years that up to 16 million people across the country could lose their insurance. Rather than being honest with the American people, they chose to hide the problem.                
                

            
                Now millions of people who are getting cancellation letters from their insurance company know the truth. In New Jersey alone, 800,000 cancellation letters have gone out.                
                

            
                When these people and others start shopping for new insurance, many will find the premiums are much higher. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina told one customer that his current plan doesn’t meet benefit requirements of the President’s health care law. It suggested a comparable plan for $1,208 a month – $980 more than he pays now.                
                

            
                A woman in California faced a 50 percent rate hike. She wrote to her insurance company, “I was all for Obamacare until I found out I was paying for it.”                
                

            
                For a lot of people, the law means more than skyrocketing premiums. Their new policies will come with higher co-pays and bigger deductibles – triple what they have now in some cases.                
                

            
                After people recover from the sticker shock of their new Washington-approved and mandated insurance, there will be more negative consequences. Many will find that their own doctor is no longer eligible to treat them under their plan. A recent survey of physician practices found that only 29 percent say they’ll take insurance sold through the government exchange. The rest have either decided not to participate or are still making up their minds.                
                

            
                Finally, if all that weren’t bad enough, people trying to buy insurance through the exchange face increased risk of fraud and identity theft. Con artists are taking advantage of the Obama Administration’s bungling by setting up fake websites and phishing scams.                
                

            
                The Democrats’ whole law was based on the idea that government is capable of running America’s health care system competently. It turns out that the government can’t even set up a website competently – and they knew it.                
                

            
                The Obama administration also knows that it will have to delay implementation of the individual mandate by at least a year. The failure has been too widespread to fix quickly. This delay needs to be approved by Congress through the regular legislative process. It should not be another case where the President waves his magic wand to change the law how he wants, when he wants.                
                

            
                Democrats got the American people into this mess unilaterally. It’s time for a bipartisan solution to get us out.

Four Reasons Why Obama's On a Roll,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Obama is on a little bit of a roll. Call it “mini-mo.” And now the latest news from Bully Pulpit Central: Obama is inviting his good friends the Congressional Republicans, as well as Congressional Democrats, to meet with him at the White House on February 25 to talk about health care policy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As a blogger for the The Washington Post headlined his piece, “Obama calls the next play for health-care reform.” OK, some might say, that’s just typical mainstream media cheerleading for the O-team, but recent events show that Obama is reclaiming the initiative. Indeed, we can identify four reasons why the 44th president has had a pretty good couple of weeks.                
                

            
                First, the State of the Union address on January 27. The big news from that speech was Obama’s “spending freeze,” which was widely ridiculed as more symbolic than substantive. But even so, the freeze demonstrated that Obama has at least some independence from Congressional Democrats. And so we can see at least the glimmers of Bill Clinton-style “triangulation.” And Clinton, of course, was a two-termer.                
                

            
                Second, the very next day, the 28th, Obama traveled to Baltimore for his televised Q-and-A with House Republicans. It’s safe to say that the GOP-ers were not overly impressed by their visitor, but they weren’t the intended audience; the American people, watching it live on TV, were the true target. And the folks at home saw Obama at his best: cool, calm, and collected, defending his positions in a high-pressure situation. And he didn’t need a TelePrompter. So all of those who have been saying that he can’t open his mouth without a TelePrompter were proven wrong. He does just fine without one--and he would, in fact, be better off if he used it less.                
                

            
                The third reason is the decline in the unemployment rate. Yes, yes, it fell to “only” 9.7 percent--a figure that would have the MSM talking about “depression” if the president were a Republican. Indeed, overall employment continued to fall, too, and so there’s reason to think that we could be in a “jobless recovery”--if, in fact, we have a recovery at all.                
                

            
                The fourth factor is something that Obama had nothing to do with. It was the decision of a leading House Republican, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, to release a strongly conservative budget plan, calling for deep cuts in spending, including the partial privatization of Social Security and the voucherization of Medicare. Maybe we need those deep cuts in spending, but for sure, those cuts are not popular with middle-of-the-road voters.                
                

            
                Congressional Democrats, seeing their own chance to get back on offense, immediately pounced on the Ryan plan, even thought it was not an official product of the House Republican leadership. As of Friday, the Democratic leadership, smelling political blood, was scheming to force a House vote on Ryan’s proposal. That would be a tough vote for most Republicans: Do they side with Ryan and the limited-government tea-partiers? Or with senior citizens and centrists?                
                

            
                Republicans with long memories will recall that the GOP has been down this particular road before. Back in 1995, another bunch of Republican insurgents had much the same idea: Cut Medicare. And another Democratic president, Bill Clinton, picked a fight with the GOP--and won. So now, with Ryan, are Republicans repeating that unhappy history? Most Republicans on Capitol Hill are looking forward to whacking Democrats this year; they are not looking forward to whacking popular programs for the elderly.                
                

            
                So now, in two-and-a-half weeks, comes Obama’s health care meeting with Congress. Obamacare has cratered, in the wake of the Scott Brown special election, and thus the White House must figure out what to do next. There’s no way to know what will happen at that session, of course, but it’s a safe bet that there won’t be much actual negotiating on February 25. Yes, we are finally getting those C-SPAN negotiating sessions that the candidate promised during the 2008 campaign--and we will soon discover why the proposal was half-baked when Obama first cooked it up.                
                

            
                But here’s another bet: Obama will do just fine later this month. As he did during the State of the Union, he will remind Republicans that since they won that 41st vote in the Senate, they, too, share the power. So, Obama will surely say, Republicans have a duty to step up and contribute to the solution.                
                

            
                The Republicans are free to say “no,” of course. They can even say “hell, no” if they want to--although if they come across as too partisan and belligerent, they will look bad to “purple” voters. And if the Loyal Opposition is really lucky, it will get a chance to put forth a few of its own health are ideas. But make no mistake: Obama will have the home-field advantage. He will set the agenda, and he will get the last word. After all, it’s his bully pulpit.                
                

            
                Yes, there’s a long way to go between now and Election Day 2010, to say nothing of Election Day 2012. But as of now, Obama is showing a better sense of how to play the game--the key realization being that he is better off playing the outside game against Republicans, as opposed to the inside game with Democrats.                
                

            
                Obama even seems to realize that when he shares the spotlight with Republicans, that’s not all bad for him. If voters are mad at Washington, this is precisely the time to share the “credit,” as far and wide as possible.

Health Care Reform -- A Giant Game of Tag Where Americans Are It,"Fri, 22 May 2009 16:30:18 +0000 –  By Robert E. MoffitDirector, Center for Health Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Think about this for a moment: President Barack Obama says that we spend too much on health care (about $2.4 trillion annually) and that it's hurting our economy. He also says we need to bend the curve (downward) on health care spending. So ... we need to spend even more on health care to save money and ""bend the curve."" Huh?                
                

            
                ------------                 
                

            
                
 Taxpayers and households will get what Washington gives them -- and pay the bills.
                
                

            
                Big savings through higher spending? If you're wondering how this will all work out, then you need to just think happy thoughts. After all, this isn't about hard-nosed budgeting, or even economics. Nor is it about access or even quality. It's about power and control -- who has it, and who exercises it, especially over the flow of health care dollars.                
                

            
                The president outlined an ambitious health policy agenda. The Congress has already enacted a large portion of it, largely through the stimulus bill and other legislation, totaling about $200 billion over 10 years in public-program expansions (SCHIP and Medicaid), including the creation of Federal Council on Comparative Effectiveness Research, and a multi-billion taxpayer ""investment"" in information technology.                
                

            
                If Congress enacts the rest of Obama's agenda, Washington will exercise an unprecedented centralization of power and control over the health care sector of the economy. Already, government controls almost half of all health care spending. The debate now is about how the government will control the rest of it.                
                

            
                Now the captains of the giant health industry -- the lobbyists for the doctors, hospitals, pharmaceuticals, the insurance industry, medical technology, along with the Service Employees International Union -- have pledged to knock off 1.5 percent annually from the nation's health care bill, accumulating roughly $2 trillion in savings over the next 10 years.                
                

            
                How? Through a series of fashionable initiatives, such as ""administrative simplification"" and ""standardization"" of insurance claim forms, electronic medical records, and the greater use of health information technology. (In other words, ensure that all the transactions driven by today's perverse health care incentives can be executed more quickly.)                
                

            
                Most of these ""savings"" initiatives are already embodied in the Obama budget. But as The Washington Post recently noted, Obama's health care savings are ""phony"" and would only cover ""a fraction"" of the real cost of his health reform agenda. Without details of how exactly these changes would be implemented, no reliable estimate of savings is possible.                
                

            
                The joint PR offensive conducted by the Obama administration and health industry chiefs highlights a troubling feature of health care debates, past and present. Health care is one of the most highly regulated sectors of our economy. That's why an army of lawyers, lobbyists and consultants routinely descend on Washington and the state capitols, trying to manipulate the rules and regulations to micromanage their competitive position at the expense of other players.                
                

            
                The result: billions of dollars in cost shifting and a giant national game of ""tag"" where ordinary Americans are ""it."" It is households, not government officials, managed care executives or employers, who ultimately pay 100 percent of the nation's health care costs. And if President Obama and his allies in Congress have their way, ordinary Americans, not just the hated ""rich,"" will be paying more for less in the form of higher taxation. Sooner or later.                
                

            
                For prominent liberals, this industry homage to the White House on health care is good news. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, for example, is suspicious of the intentions of the health care industry, but he considers their pledge to help the president real progress. Obama and his congressional allies, after all, want to expand federal control over health care. Krugman likes that.                
                

            
                Perhaps health care industry chiefs think that greater federal control is inevitable; by playing ball, so to speak, maybe Congress won't ""hurt"" them. Or they realize that official Washington is going to pursue little more than an expansion of the status quo, public and employment-based third-party payment, with some version of a new public health plan and another thick layer of federal regulation.                
                

            
                The president is asking Congress to budget an additional $634 billion over 10 years in a reserve fund for reform -- without any details of what that reform would be. But many experts expect the real 10-year costs would exceed $1 trillion. That presents an irresistible temptation for Congress and Washington lobbyists to forgo any heavy health policy lifting, and to figure out how to divvy up another big chunk of taxpayer money.                
                

            
                In short, taxpayers and households will get what Washington gives them -- and pay the bills. Forget ""bending"" the spending curve.                
                

            
                Real health reform would mean real change, a transfer of direct control over health care dollars to individuals and families in both public and private health programs. Making plans and providers directly accountable to individuals and families would ignite a health care revolution. That, of course, could be dangerous.

"Abortion, Social Justice and Health Care Reform","AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                During the past few days we have heard two cries regarding the health care debate in the Senate.
One, health care reform is an issue of social justice and not a referendum on abortion, as noted by both Senators Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Barbara Mikulski (D- Md.)                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Two, Sen. Barbara Mikulski’s statement that she is “whole life” and that a vote for the health care reform bill is a vote as “pro-life or whole life as anyone can cast.”                
                

            
                Whole Life America, America’s premier whole life resource, takes issue with both these assertions.                
                

            
                Health care reform is an issue of social justice. One of the primary issues, if not the primary issue of social justice, is the fundamental right to life. If you claim to be concerned with ""social justice"" you cannot, at the same time, be for the right to end the life of an unborn human being.
Social justice, if we listen to Senators Mikulski and Reid, concerns the whole of the human being—including his or her health care and access to that health care. Whole Life America recognizes and applauds the cry for human dignity that is inherent to the cry for social justice within the health care reform debate.                
                

            
                However, nothing could be further from social justice than an act which has robbed over 46 million Americans of their lives since 1973. If, as the senators would have us believe, this health care reform debate is in fact an issue of social justice then any part of it that sanctions stripping any member of our society of his or her fundamental rights—terminating someone’s life is such an act—cannot in good conscience be truthfully called social justice.                
                

            
                Furthermore, Sen. Mikulski’s claim that she is whole life based on her determination to provide universal health care begs the question—what does it mean to be whole life?                
                

            
                To be termed ‘whole life’ is rooted in one criterion: you must be dedicated to promoting human dignity for all people. As the Whole Life Mission states: “The mission of the Whole Life initiative is to promote a respect for the intrinsic dignity of the human person regardless of ability, age, status, ethnicity or sex.”
The fundamental principle of the whole life ethic is the incomparable worth of the human person. The Whole Life Ethic seeks to protect human dignity from the embryo to the streets of Iran, from the unborn child to the child in Darfur, from the young woman facing a crisis pregnancy to the old man confronted with insurmountable health care fees.                
                

            
                To be whole life means you understand that a human being is recognized as a person at the moment of his biological beginning and that he is worthy of respect from that moment and through the entirety of his life until it reaches its natural conclusion.                
                

            
                To be whole life means you are willing to stand up and defend human dignity from the child in the womb to the child in Darfur, from the embryo to the elderly no matter the cost to yourself.
For some—like Neda Agha Soltan, who lost her life in June on the streets of Iran—defending human dignity comes at a very high cost. Others—like the leaders of this country—only risk losing their political capital or house seat.                
                

            
                If you are not willing to stand up to the abortion industry on the floor of the senate, in the oval office, at work, at school or with friends, then the idea that you would be willing to stand up to the Janjaweed in Darfur, the Taliban in Afghanistan, or the regime leaders in Iran is absurd.
The biggest threat to human dignity in the United States is abortion—it shows no mercy to unborn children and it breaks the hearts of women and men. Around the world there are many threats to human dignity, however, echoing a great promoter of human dignity who risked his freedom and gave his life: a threat to human dignity anywhere is a threat to human dignity everywhere.
People who are whole life disagree on many issues and policies.                
                

            
                While we all agree that we want everyone to have access to quality health care we can disagree on how that is best achieved.                
                

            
                In order to identify yourself as whole life you must promote human dignity unilaterally—you cannot pick and choose who has human dignity and who does not. That is not your decision and that is certainly far above anyone on earth’s pay grade.                
                

            
                To date those who have cried for social justice have been markedly silent on fundamental social justice issues including the assault on freedom in Iran, the slaughter of innocents in Darfur, the suspension of the death penalty in the United States, and last, but not least, the right to kill one out of every five unborn children worldwide.                
                

            
                Do not be silent on human dignity—whatever your occupation—but rather, stand with the greats, and tell the world, “From the child in the womb to the child in Darfur, from the embryo to the elderly, I am whole life.”

"After the First GOP Debate, Team Obama Should Be Taking Notes","One thing is clear from the first presidential debate for the GOP candidates--at least of the ones who chose to be there--President Obama's days are numbered.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                With only five of the declared candidates for the GOP nomination in attendance, and notably a weaker field in terms of name recognition, gravitas, and moxy, the ninety minutes went by with a surprising amount of substance being diligently discussed.                
                

            
                In other words facts, issues, circumstances, and policies will not be merely side shows in the 2012 campaign. And if the second tier candidates realize this in spades, imagine how the more forceful candidates, or potential candidates will add to the chorus that was clearly begun tonight: ""President Obama has been a disaster and it's time to choose a different direction.""                
                

            
                Kudos to Bret Baier and Team Washington from Fox News for pouring substance into just about every question asked. Chris Wallace, Shannon Bream, and Juan Williams asked pointed, direct questions, and pressed for direct answers.                 
                

            
                Though pressing wasn't all that necessary given how eagerly and transparently the participants put forward their ideas.
On style, smoothness, preparedness, and performance many will give the win on the debate to former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty. He communicated well, handled a variety of issues to the general liking of most conservatives and on the question that would likely hurt him the most--a Chris Wallace query on seemingly conflicting positions on cap and trade legislation--he was candid and humble. A lesson the current President could learn much from.                
                

            
                Senator Rick Santorum gave what the GOP has come to expect from him, knowledgeable answers, an emphasis on the dangers posed by Iran, and the champion fighter for all things of social and moral values. Santorum was particularly effective in linking social values issues to the very core definition and belief of what it means to be, uniquely, American.                
                

            
                Ron Paul was the libertarian crank, and as expected--denouncing the fed, calling for it's end, denouncing all extraneous military action taking place across the global war on terror, giving his approval to gay marriage, prostitution, and of course, the attempt to legalize heroin.                
                

            
                Gary Johnson came off as whiny, a poor sport, and pretty much a one note pony somewhat incapable of moving off the topic of ""cost benefit"" analysis.                
                

            
                Businessman and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain came off effective and winsome, perhaps the surprise of the night--especially for people that had not heard from him previously.                
                

            
                A first of sorts in the format was the opportunity to rebuff potential or declared candidates who did not show for the proceedings. Tim Pawlenty was asked early on about the albatross that will dog Gov. Romney every day he is in the race--the failure of Romney-care that in essence served as the blueprint for Obamacare. Pawlenty deftly side-stepped criticizing Romney directly while going on to destroy the very definition of the health care reform plans of both RomneyCare and ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Herman Cain was asked about his endorsement of Governor Romney in 2008, in his response he cited Romney's business abilities and prowess to create jobs, but went on to say that the Governor had lost in 2008 and now it was his time as a businessman to bring new effort to the fight.                
                

            
                Ron Paul dissed Michele Bachmann, Gary Johnson got in stabs at both Donald Trump and Sarah Palin while trying to fill time in coming up with an answer to the question of what his reality show would look like.                
                

            
                And Tim Pawlenty surprisingly uttered, ""I LOVE THE HUCK!"" He was equally effusive about Governor Huckabee's wife, family, and former opportunities to work together on issues as governors.                
                

            
                The truth is that none of the candidates in this debate will be president in 2013. But from their status as strong bench players for the team that is still largely on the sidelines, they put in a tremendous performance on articulating answers to the biggest challenges facing us, and when these debates start happening with the ""starters"" on the field, Team Obama had better be taking notes.                
                

            
                As Herman Cain revealed--the one decision of taking down Bin Ladin, will not be the totality of the presidential argument. And as all of the candidates indicated--economic recovery not yet realized makes America weaker by the day.                
                

            
                So notice has been served, the journey begun, and the incumbent--coming off his biggest win in office to date--is back to playing defense.

"JUAN WILLIAMS: Yes, This Election Was All About Obama. So Now What?","The votes are in.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is a Republican colored “Morning in America,” or at least in the House of Representatives. The Senate also has a noticeably more reddish, Republican, glow. So is it fair for Democrats to blame President Obama? Is it fair for Republicans to say that the 2010 midterm election that amounted to a rebuff of President Obama?                
                

            
                The answer to both questions is yes.                
                

            
                The White House knew by late summer that this election cycle had been nationalized and President Obama was on the hot seat. After Labor Day the president took to the campaign trail to do over 70 fundraisers, appear at about 20 political rallies and do countless radio and TV interviews including MTV and Comedy Central.                
                

            
                Despite that investment of presidential capital Republicans gained control of the House and made record gains in the Senate – though they fell short of gaining the majority.                 
                

            
                So, now what does the nation’s chief executive do to reverse his political fortunes before the 2012 presidential election?                
                

            
                When President Clinton faced a similar political predicament after the 1994 midterms he accepted the idea of a political rebuke and famously began to ‘triangulate’ by moving to the political middle ground, notably on taxes and welfare.                 
                

            
                Clinton was the former two-time governor of a moderate Southern state – Arkansas – where he demonstrated the capacity to stage a comeback after conservatives ousted him from governor’s office. The point is that President Clinton knew how to change course in response to an altered landscape.                
                

            
                By contrast, President Obama is the still convinced, his top aides told me earlier this week, that he is doing what is right for the American people in the long run and feels history will vindicate him for daring to withstand the political volatility.                
                

            
                He has no second thoughts about his decision to bail out Wall Street firms and pass a reform package for the financial industry, spend heavily on a stimulus package that has become a political liability, and put his party on the hook for passing health care reform.                
                

            
                The White House view is that the American electorate is upset about high unemployment and a slow economic recovery and is lashing out.                
                

            
                A Fox News poll exit poll found nearly two-thirds of all voters said they went to the polls either to support or oppose the man in the White House. That breaks down to 24 percent who said their vote was in support of the president and 38 percent who said they went to the polls to make a statement of opposition to the president.                
                

            
                A Rasmussen reports poll found that 52 percent of likely voters saw the election as having more to do with their judgment on the president than with the candidates or issues on their local ballots.And that survey also found 56 percent of Americans queried saying that President Obama should change course after the election even though two-thirds said they did not expect him to change.                
                

            
                Among the energized, partisan voters the results are even more dramatic. A Wall Street Journal poll found that among voters who strongly wanted a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, in other words energized Republican voters, 45 percent said they cast their votes as a protest against President Obama and the current Democratic majority in the House.                
                

            
                That is not as strong a vote as the 65 percent partisan Democrats cast against President Bush in the 2006 cycle when Democrats took control of the House. But it was stronger than the 41 percent of Republicans who said their 1994 vote to give control of Congress to Republicans was a vote against then President Bill Clinton.                
                

            
                This comes as President Obama’s approval ratings remain in the low to mid-40 percent range. That is on level with the approval ratings for President Carter, Reagan and Clinton at the same point in their presidencies.                
                

            
                But what is key in looking at President Obama’s standing with the American people is that this is the same man who won the presidency with a strong 52.9 percent of the vote and at the time of his inauguration had a favorability rating of about 70 percent.                
                

            
                It has been quite a fall from grace. A mid-October Gallup poll found that President Obama’s favorability rating -- 47 percent -- is now exceeded by his unfavorable rating – 50 percent.                
                

            
                The key to the president’s personal political recovery plan is to win back independent voters. And to make that case he has to demonstrate that he is genuinely interested in working with Republicans.                
                

            
                The obvious targets for White House compromise begins with extending the Bush tax cuts to people who make more than $250,000 for two years or more – beyond the 2012 presidential contest.                
                

            
                Next in line are more tax breaks and capital investment incentives for small businesses.                
                

            
                And then there is the serious business of working with Republicans on cuts to government spending, specifically on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security.                
                

            
                If the president makes the case to independent voters that he is committed to bipartisan efforts to spur the economy and produce jobs he can climb back and win when his name is again on the ballot.                
                

            
                If he prefers to stand on the conviction that he is right and those swing voters are wrong he may well be vindicated by history but it will be the political equivalent of ”Nightfall in America” for Obama at the end of his first term.

Obamacare Is the Next Roe v. Wade,"Once again, the big issue is abortion. And while the happy-days-are-here-again headlines will be playing big in the mainstream media in the wake of the House health care vote, the cold reality is that once again, Democrats have chosen a politically risky course, which will likely further alienate them from the center-right majority in the country. Indeed, the tricky tactics used by the Democratic majority in Congress to enact Obamacare in 2010 will be remembered alongside the Supreme Court’s divisive decision on Roe v. Wade back in 1973. In both instances, conservatives did not start these political-cultural battles, but in both instances, conservatives are destined to win them.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The dam broke loose in favor of Obamacare on Sunday afternoon, when Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) announced that he was supporting the legislation, after all. Stupak had been arguing for months with his fellow Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, over pro-life protections in the bill--specifically, the absence of a blanket prohibition against federal funds being used to finance abortions. For months, Stupak had insisted that he and as many as 11 fellow Democrats could not vote for the bill as written and passed by the Senate in December, because of those missing abortion provisions. And for a while, it seemed that Obamacare might founder on that issue. Indeed, as recently as Saturday, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a letter: “With deep regret, but clear in our moral judgment, we are compelled to continue to urge House members to oppose the Senate bill unless these fundamental flaws are remedied.”                
                

            
                The “fundamental flaws” that the bishops identified were not remedied because pro-choice Democrats were just as firm the other way--and pro-choicers are far more numerous and powerful inside the Democratic Party. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said on Saturday that 50 Democrats would walk away from the deal if the Democratic leadership made any concessions to Stupak on abortion.                
                

            
                But on Sunday, Stupak blinked. Of course, he would prefer to say that he squeezed a vital concession out of the White House; President Obama announced that he would issue an Executive Order codifying the funding prohibition. Immediately thereafter, as part of an obvious arrangement, Stupak and many of his Democratic allies went to the microphones to announce their support for Obamacare. “I've always supported health care reform,” said Stupak. But he added, “There was a principal that meant more to us than anything, and that was the sanctity of life.”                
                

            
                But many close observers don’t believe that Stupak’s deal with Obama protects that sanctity. That’s the opinion of most Right to Life leaders, including William Saunders, senior vice president of legal affairs for Americans United for Life Action, who dismissed the efficacy of Obama’s Executive Order in Sunday’s edition of The Washington Examiner; Saunders noted that it could be overturned by the courts at any time, or simply rescinded by the president. Saunders concluded: “Congress failed to deliver a statutory prohibition on abortion funding in health care reform, and an executive order cannot do the job.”                
                

            
                We will find out soon enough, of course, but if history is a guide, it won’t be long before pro-choice activists find some legal or regulatory way to poke holes in Obama’s figleaf of an Executive Order. And then, of course, will come the political backlash from the broad middle of the country. Most Americans don’t like to think about the abortion issue, but when the issue heats up, the majority gravitates to the conservative side of the issue.                
                

            
                That’s been the story of the past four decades, although liberals never saw it coming. To get a glimpse of their thinking, we might go back to The New York Times editorial in the wake of the Roe v. Wade decision, published on January 24, 1973. Needless to say, The Times supported the decision, calling it “a major contribution to the preservation of individual liberties,” but what’s interesting is how wrong the Times was about the future direction of abortion politics. The “verdict on abortion provides a sound foundation for final and reasonable resolution of a debate that has divided America too long,” The Times wrote, even as Catholics and evangelicals--once pillars of the Democratic Party--were starting to mobilize against the Court decision. And that was a major reason why the old New Deal coalition broke up.                
                

            
                The enduring power of that conservative backlash was noted, and lamented on the 30th anniversary of Roe by journalist William Saletan, a writer for the liberal Slate.com, in a book entitled ""Bearing Right: How Conservatives Won the Abortion War."" As Saletan observed, “The people who hold the balance of power in the abortion debate are those who favor tradition, family, property . . . Liberals haven’t won the struggle for abortion rights. Conservatives have.”                 
                

            
                The next year, of course, pro-life George W. Bush went on to win re-election to the presidency, and Republicans made substantial gains in Congress. The Republican hegemony cracked up over Iraq and the economic meltdown in 2006 and 2008, but, as we have seen since then, the natural conservative majority--newly energized by the Tea Parties of 2009--is quickly reconstituting itself.                
                

            
                That’s why so many analysts expect to see huge Republican gains in the coming midterm elections this November. As House Minority Leader John Boehner reminded his forces on Sunday, “A 'yes' vote for this government takeover of health care is a 'yes' vote for sending hard-earned tax dollars to pay for abortions.” That will hurt, out in the Heartland.                
                

            
                But of course, the fight will go on much longer than that. The abortion issue, like life itself, refuses to go away.

                 Is health care bill a victory for America?Yes. It's not perfect, but it's a giant step in the right direction.
Unsure. I agree that the health insurance industry needs reform, but is this the answer?
No. This is just a giant tax package wrapped in 2,700 pages stamped ""health care reform.""

Forget Paris: Tax reform is the most important issue of 2017,"The establishment press is easily distracted. Their goal is to sell papers or TV advertising.

                The success of the Trump presidency will hinge on the passage of pro-growth tax reform that addresses the American competitiveness problem, boosts the economy, creates more jobs, and leads to higher wages.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                For the economy to grow, tax reform must be permanent, it must lead to competitive tax rates with territoriality, and it must allow immediate expensing of business assets.
                
                


                
            
                It has been more than 30 years since the tax code was reformed, and in that time, the world has changed drastically. Other countries have updated their tax codes and lowered their rates, while the U.S. system has barely changed. 
                
                


                
            
                Over the past decade, the economy has struggled at just two percent GDP growth – the worst recovery of the modern era. This lackluster recovery has cost families an average of $8,600 in annual income, according to the Joint Economic Committee. The Congressional Budget Office projects that two percent growth will continue into the next decade under current policies.
                
                


                
            
                Today, American businesses are taxed at rates far exceeding the rates faced by foreign competitors. The average federal/state corporate tax rate in the U.S. is roughly 39 percent, while the average rate paid by foreign competitors is about 25 percent. Businesses organized as pass-through entities face even higher rates – above 40 percent, and even 50 percent when state tax rates are accounted for.
                
                


                
            
                While the U.S. rate remains high, other countries have adapted to the global changes by aggressively reducing their rates. Today, only the U.S. and Chile have higher corporate tax rates than they did at the start of the century. 
                
                


                
            
                People, not businesses, pay taxes, so high business rates are directly absorbed by employees, consumers, and investors through lower wages, fewer jobs, and stagnant economic growth. 
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            As much as 70 percent of the corporate tax cost is borne by labor, according to the CBO. Every dollar increase in the corporate rate decreases wages by two dollars.
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
            
                As much as 70 percent of the corporate tax cost is borne by labor, according to the CBO. Every dollar increase in the corporate rate decreases wages by two dollars.
                
                


                
            
                In addition to lower rates, the code must be updated so it is globally competitive.
                
                


                
            
                Today, the U.S. is only one of six developed countries with a worldwide system of taxation. Because of this system, American businesses operating overseas are double taxed on income – once when they earn it in the country they are operating in, and again when they bring this money back into the U.S. economy.
                
                


                
            
                American businesses are faced with a disadvantage relative to their foreign competitors, and this system has also resulted in an estimated $2.6 trillion in after-tax income being stranded overseas, unable to be reinvested in the U.S. economy. Moving to territoriality will fix this competitiveness problem and allow businesses to compete.
                
                


                
            
                Tax reform should also move toward a cash-flow system where business investments can be immediately deducted.
                
                


                
            
                Under the current code, business owners cannot immediately expense the cost of purchasing equipment against their taxable income. Instead, they are required to deduct, or “depreciate,” these costs over several years depending on the asset they purchase, as dictated by complex and arbitrary IRS tables. These rules create needless complexity and increase compliance costs.
                
                


                
            
                Moving to a cash-flow system where businesses can immediately recover the cost of their purchases also leads to strong economic growth. According to the Tax Foundation, full business expensing increases GDP by five percent after a decade and increases wages by four percent.
                
                


                
            
                A tax plan that includes competitive rates, territoriality, and expensing will allow Trump to meet his promise of strong economic growth. These changes must be made permanent so taxpayers have the certainty to make decisions that drive economic growth.
                
                


                
            
                The U.S. tax code of 2017 is outdated, uncompetitive, and complex. It restricts the growth of new jobs, increases the cost of capital, and discourages innovation. Reforming this code with pro-growth policies must be the top priority for lawmakers this year.

"Medicine, Not Health Care Reform, Helps Bill Clinton Mend","Former President Bill Clinton, now in a New York City hospital room, under observation for chest pains, might be thinking to himself that it's a good thing that Clintoncare didn't pass in the early 90s. If it had, it's a safe bet that the sort of technological innovation that is keeping him alive tonight would never have advanced as far as it has. Clintoncare, after all, was about rationing; The explicit goal of that bureaucratic program was to reduce the cost of treatment, which is to say, reduce the amount of treatment. And Clinton needs more treatment, not less. As do many of us.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Moreover, Clinton, now 63, might also be quietly hoping that Obamacare never passes, either, because, as he now realizes, he is going to be a major consumer of Serious Medicine in the years ahead.                
                

            
                By Serious Medicine, I mean such procedures and technologies as open heart surgery, stents, and angioplasties. Those technologies barely existed a half century ago, but they are now routine. Indeed, on ""NBC Nightly News,"" on Thursday, Robert Bazell said that a million Americans now have stents. That's a million lives saved, or at least dramatically improved.                
                

            
                How did all that happen? Where did this life-saving technology come from? A lot of it came from government-funded research. (Note to ardent free marketeers: Government is not the enemy.) But life-saving research came from the part of the government, i.e. the National Institutes of Health, that fosters research and even cures. It's great work that they do, and yet as we all know, the far greater government effort in recent years has been the effort for ""health insurance reform."" Indeed, the entire political class, on the right as well as left, seems transfixed by the issue of health care finance. But the real issue is health. And the real question, for heart disease and everything else is, ""Can we cure it or not?""                
                

            
                By contrast, ""health insurance"" is simply much less important to Americans, if not to American politicos. If you have heart disease, you need treatment more than you need insurance. Both can be important, but treatment is more important. Treatment is the sine qua non--without which, nothing.                
                

            
                So heart patients can be grateful that others in the past cared enough to do heart research--and yet those heart patients would be even more grateful if they knew that someone was effectively researching not only treatments, but cures.                
                

            
                Happily, the liberal health insurance crusade keeps losing, in the 90s, and today. But we might worry that even the losing crusade might be enough to cast a shadow over medical research, for heart disease and for every other medical topic. That is, even the mere hint of government-driven rationing and price-controlling might be enough to chase venture capital into other fields, away from medicine. We'll never know for sure how much ""crowding out"" of medical money has taken place, but it must be substantial. That's another question for Bill Clinton to think about tonight.                
                

            
                And so, too, for all of us to think about. Because the bell that could be tolling for him will be tolling, as well, for every American. But better later rather sooner.

The hidden message in Obama's 'farewell' speech,"President Barack Obama speaks at McCormick Place in Chicago, Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, giving his presidential farewell address.

                Five days into the 1993 calendar – 15 days before his White House stay concluded – George H.W. Bush traveled to West Point for one last presidential address.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The event was short on bells and whistles. Gray-uniformed Army cadets provided the backdrop. The event opened with the National Emblem March and wrapped up with the West Point March. Bush’s reward for making the trek up the Hudson River: a cadet parka – a curious bit of clothing for a Navy man.                
                

            
                Bush 41 was all business that solemn day. He chose the venue to impart wisdom on what role the attending future warriors would play in global theatres. He chose not to pat himself on the back for peacefully concluding the Cold War and humiliating Saddam Hussein, but instead outlined America’s commitments as a triumphant superpower in a reshaped world.                
                

            
                Fast-forward 14 years and five days to Chicago’s Lakeside Center at McCormick Place and President Obama’s Tuesday evening “farewell address” before an effusive crowd – the second time, now, that an outgoing president said goodbye in a venue beyond the nation’s capital.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Obama chose the moment and the setting (it’s where he gave his victory speech on Election Night 2012) to bask in idolatry rather than say much that will stand the test of time.
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                Two things you should know about Obama’s last hurrah:                
                

            
                First, it wasn’t so much “farewell” as “to be continued”.                
                

            
                Come a week from Friday, Obama will be the first ex-president since Woodrow Wilson to stay in Washington once his administration ends.                
                

            
                On Tuesday night, Obama made it clear that, unlike the enfeebled Wilson (or the gracious George W. Bush, for that matter), he plans to be quite vocal – on everything from illegal immigration, replacing ObamaCare, climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal – if he feels the necessity.                
                

            
                Second, Obama chose the moment and the setting (it’s where he gave his victory speech on Election Night 2012) to bask in idolatry rather than say much that will stand the test of time.                
                

            
                As such, it was a disappointing finale to a presidency that, too often and in too many different ways, placed too high of a premium on celebrity status and cult of personality – an American colossus ruled by Narcissus.                
                

            
                Here’s a list of presidential farewell addresses, from the pre-modern written versions to this generation’s televised goodbyes.                
                

            
                They include our nation’s first President George Washington establishing a peaceful transfer of power, Andrew Jackson showcasing populism, Dwight Eisenhower warning of a “military-industrial complex” and Ronald Reagan embracing of a “shining city on a hill”.                
                

            
                Those and most other presidential farewell tended to be futuristic in their substance. Big-picture speeches.                
                

            
                And Obama?                
                

            
                He did go big-picture in the beginning, tapping the Founding Fathers and the concept of a more perfect union and a republic defined by generational embraces of American exceptionalism. And he lamented the current “state of democracy” – Americans needing to set aside their differences for the good of the nation’s solidarity.                
                

            
                However, too much of the 54-minute address was devoted to a recitation and defense of a progressive record.                
                

            
                Obama talked up the broadening the definition of marriage, rebooting relations with Cuba and what he claims to be a healthier economy with poverty on the wane.                
                

            
                On the topic of inequality, he referenced “a new social compound” that’s, in effect, a back door to more unionization, more social-program spending and higher taxation of the affluent.                
                

            
                Get used to more of this. Part of Obama’s post-presidency will include revamping Organizing for Action, a group born from his campaign machine and tasked with candidate recruitment.                
                

            
                Obama also claimed that race relations have improved over the recent decades, arguably his wobbliest words as (a) he removed his presidency from the equation and (b) in a city fraught with intra-racial homicides, it was just five days ago that four black Chicagoans were arrested for torturing a white special-needs teen live on Facebook.                
                

            
                However, the topic of race was also one of Obama’s stronger moments: calling on white Americans to better understand minority struggles with equality; minorities learning to better appreciate white struggles with a changing economy. “We all have to try harder,” he neatly surmised.                
                

            
                Still, Obama couldn’t resist the subtle dig at his successor (“science and reason matter”) and the loyal opposition (“how can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, not when we’re cutting taxes for corporations?”), even if it was cloaked in a nobler call for both parties to stop engaging in double standards.                
                

            
                Not until nearly midway into his remarks did the only president to serve an entire two terms with a nation at war delve into terrorism.                
                

            
                Not that it was much a deep dive.                
                

            
                The former constitutional law professor rolled ISIS into a big ball of human rights, women’s right and LBGT rights – and from there, naturally, protecting voting rights and a closing passage in which Obama called for his countrymen to became a nation of community organizers.                  
                

            
                Add it up and, for one last time, America was witness to the Obama paradox. Twice, this very personable man was elected to the nation’s highest office. He’ll leave office with healthy approval numbers.                
                

            
                Yet on three separate occasions – two midterm elections and Hillary Clinton’s ill-fated stab at “hope” and “change” – the American people rejected the man’s ideas and ideology.                
                

            
                One good thing about star power, as Obama showed this one last time as president: it means not going unnoticed.                
                

            
                Back in 2009, George W. Bush’s press minions had to grovel for airtime for their boss’s farewell address from the East Room of the White House. This time around, none of the three major television networks balked at granting Obama coverage live and in primetime.                
                

            
                And good television it was.                
                

            
                As per usual, the words were melodic. The crowd was spellbound; a fawning media will swoon over the passages.                
                

            
                But with Obama it’s always been a temporary high – a long, rhetorical nitrous oxide hit before returning to the sobering realities of a sluggish economy, flawed health care reform, a socially divided nation and a world stage dotted with bad actors.                
                

            
                Despite the lofty language, the kind optics and the man’s cool presence on stage, Obama’s party paid a terrible price down-ticket in congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative numbers. Last November, the electorate handed the presidency to a man who’s the anti-Obama in taste, temperament, experience and execution.                
                

            
                Saying farewell can be hard – especially when one’s party has been left in the dust.

Can the Government Really Force You to Buy Health Insurance?,"President Obama was in Pennsylvania on Monday, trying to sell his health care plan to America at a town hall meeting. As Congress continues to debate how to move forward with health care reform its members should take this time to revisit the “purchase requirement” included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill. Each bill penalizes Americans for not purchasing “acceptable” health insurance, which is arguably unconstitutional.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Never before has our federal government required us to purchase anything deemed in our “best interest,” or face monetary penalties. If our federal government is permitted to penalize Americans in this manner, for simply doing nothing – in this case, not purchasing health insurance – then there will be absolutely no substantive constitutional restraints on the federal government's power over Americans.                
                

            
                Both versions of the health care reform bills currently under consideration use the Constitution’s “Commerce Clause” as one of their legal crutches to justify the federal government’s authority to either tax or penalize individuals who choose not to purchase insurance. Under this clause, Congress has the authority to regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce; the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce; and those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce. Although those three areas are broad in scope, the taxing or penalizing of an individual taxpayer for not purchasing insurance simply does not fall under any of them. If it were to come close to any area, it would be the third, but Supreme Court precedent shows even that would be a stretch of the constitutional imagination of legal scholars.                
                

            
                The Senate bill uses a “penalty” and defends the federal government’s power to assess one under the legal precedent of the Supreme Court case of “United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association.” That ruling allowed for the federal regulation of the business of insurance under the Commerce Clause, and focused on nationwide insurance businesses engaged in interstate commerce. In no way are individual Americans in the “business” of insurance and, therefore, the Commerce Clause does not apply. In other words, the mere failure to purchase a policy of health insurance is not an activity affecting interstate commerce. The right to purchase insurance is personal, and should rightfully be reserved to the American people.                
                

            
                The best example of how the Supreme Court may actually strike down the Senate bill’s penalty (or the House version for that matter) is by looking at a case in which the lack of an interstate “activity” denied the application of the Commerce Clause. In “The United States v. Lopez,” the court struck down the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990 by ruling that merely “possessing a firearm” within a school zone was in no sense an economic activity “substantially” affecting interstate commerce, and therefore was outside of Congress’s authority.                
                

            
                In the House bill, a “tax” is used against an individual who chooses not to purchase “acceptable” health care. Although cloaked as a tax, it is in reality an unconstitutional penalty disguised as a tax. Under the Constitution, Congress cannot regulate through its general power to tax that which it cannot regulate directly, unless such is truly “incidental” to the real motive, which is to raise revenue for the general welfare of the federal government. The mysterious extractions imposed in both bills are clearly not intended to raise significant revenue for the general welfare of the federal government.                
                

            
                The Constitution simply does not envision the type of tax the House bill includes and there is no Supreme Court precedent entertaining such. Left unchecked, if Congress is permitted to use the magical word “tax” to regulate taxpayers who merely fail to purchase acceptable health insurance, it will completely eviscerate any remaining restrictions on the federal government’s enumerated powers. It is one thing for Congress to have comprehensive taxation authority for the general welfare of the citizens of the United States, but forcing mandatory compliance of a person not participating in any activity (privileged or otherwise) or receiving any federal benefit goes far beyond even the Supreme Court regulatory tax cases involving activities reserved exclusively to the states. Congress cannot coerce non-consenting taxpayers into participating in a universal health insurance scheme by forcing them to enter into insurance contracts or else pay a penalty disguised as a tax.                
                

            
                To be clear, Congress cannot regulate our right to purchase what we want, when we want, and if we want. The Constitution and years of Supreme Court precedent simply doesn’t allow it. If Congress manages to pass either health care reform bill, or any compromise version that contains a purchase requirement, the Supreme Court most likely will declare it unconstitutional.

"Here’s Your Better Health Insurance Plan, Mr. President","At his State of the Union address, President Obama asked for other ideas on health care reform:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But if anyone from either party has a better approach [on health care reform]…let me know. (Applause.) Let me know. Let me know. (Applause.) I'm eager to see it.                
                

            
                Since yesterday’s health summit produced no results or new ideas, here’s your better health insurance plan, Mr. President.                
                

            
                This is What’s Really Wrong With the Current System                
                

            
                Insurance is a bet. Every month when people pay $1,000.00 for health insurance, they’re betting they WILL get sick. The insurance company is betting they WON’T.                
                

            
                While there are unfortunate people who get sick, serious illness for most people is rare for most of their lives. Every month working families make a sucker’s bet: Betting $1,000 dollars that they will get sick when the odds say they won’t. Month after month they lose the bet, and lose another $1,000 that could be well spent elsewhere.                
                

            
                
Under the CURRENT system, for many families, the only winning move is not to have insurance (so many choose not to). In ten years they will save $120,000 -- more than enough to pay doctors for the usual sicknesses and calamities such as broken bones, etc.                
                

            
                But if you are an American who has wealth to protect either in savings or home equity, you should buy medical insurance not for the bet, but to protect your assets in the rare instance you do get terribly ill. However, if you are the average American living “paycheck to paycheck” with little savings and little home equity, the better bet for you is not to buy insurance at these prices, since the $12,000 price tag is a whopping 23.9% of American median income ($50,233.00). Why spend 1 out of every 4 dollars on something you don’t use?                
                

            
                What’s Wrong With the System Democrats In Congress Are Proposing?                
                

            
                COMPETITION is what drives PRICES DOWN and QUALITY UP. The reason to have a Department of Justice Anti-trust Unit is to make sure there is no monopoly, no single source for goods or services, because that hurts price and quality.                
                

            
                Now imagine a country were EVERYONE is insured, even with PRIVATE coverage. Richer people will buy costly policies and poorer people cheaper policies. All of the money gets “pooled” and only people who get sick or are rich or poor, will use it. Those who stay healthy won’t use it.                
                

            
                So full insurance will work like this: “From each according to his ability [wealth], to each according to his need [illness].” Sound familiar? It’s exactly how Karl Marx described the principle of communism in 1875.                
                

            
                A system where everyone is fully insured is therefore “privatized communism.” Nothing changes if you include a “public option” or “co-ops” or go fully socialized with a government single-payer plan. The financial theory of communism still governs.                
                

            
                Full insurance is bad policy because the more insurance you have, the less competition you have.
In America, there are approximately 630,000 physicians who could be competing for you medical dollars. They used to, and they hustled from house call to house call to be your doctor.                 
                

            
                Today, you sit for 2 hours in a waiting room to be seen, for no other reason than the doctor takes your insurance. Why did that change happen?                
                

            
                Competition was whittled down from 630,000 doctors to 1,300 health insurance companies. Also, you can’t buy insurance across state lines. Therefore, the competition for your insurance money is really a choice of about 25 companies authorized to sell insurance in your state. The president once argued that in 34 states 5 or fewer insurance companies control the market. Adding one government insurer won’t help. Don’t be fooled into thinking insurance companies represent the best of capitalism. They don’t. Insurance pools limit your choices instead of expanding them.                
                

            
                So what would make for a better system?                
                

            
                The Fix: Bring Back “Hospitalization” and “Catastrophic” Insurance                
                

            
                Ever wonder why Ozzie & Harriet, Howard & Marion Cunningham or even Fred Sanford never complained about the cost of health insurance? In the 1940’s, ‘50’s and ‘60’s people could buy a “hospitalization” policy to cover them only when they went into the hospital, and a “catastrophic” policy to cover them when they had a disease that needed constant care. Since those events are rare, the policies were CHEAP.                
                

            
                People paid their family doctor directly. Only the costly items were insured. In those days that was real choice determining how to insure yourself.                
                

            
                In the 1970’s, the concept of the HMO was unveiled. Suddenly there would be coverage for EVERY LITTLE THING, from the visit to the doctor right down to the 10 cent aspirin. Ask anyone with health insurance how much their doctor charges for an office visit. They don’t know and they don’t care, even though they are paying $1,000 a month for insurance to cover that 10 cent aspirin.                
                

            
                Doctors and insurance companies love the current insurance plan! They’ll no longer sell you just hospitalization or catastrophic insurance, so you HAVE TO buy the whole package, even if you rarely or never use it, or you can buy nothing at all. It’s called an “illegal tying agreement” when a company makes people buy a second product in order to buy the first. That’s why the Department of Justice Anti-trust Unit sued Bill Gates for selling Windows bundled with Internet Explorer.                
                

            
                But the DOJ, who slept while so many companies became “too big to fail” and filed no charges while the companies bragged about it to Congress to get tax dollars, is still sleeping. Insurance killed competition among doctors. Insurance killed competition further by forcing you to buy comprehensive coverage instead of just coverage for things you want. – Making you unable to buy insurance across state lines killed competition further. The DOJ snoozes.                
                

            
                The best plan for health care reform is old-fashioned capitalistic choice – let people choose to pay their doctor for office visits, and buy hospitalization and catastrophic policies, across state lines, to cover just the expensive items.                
                

            
                Expect doctors and insurance companies to fight the idea – they don’t want to compete or lose the money you’re wasting on them each month by being excessively insured.

"I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar","Sarah Palin said last week that the “mama grizzlies,” -- those women who are rising up and becoming advocates for their country -- would take back this nation. There is indeed a new breed of women activists in America today. Indeed, roughly 45% of Tea Party activists are women. However, they aren't like the women who came of age in the 60s and 70s who were shrugging off the ""bondage"" of children and families and rallying around a newfound independence. No, today's women activists have taken to the streets and the voting booths for just the opposite reason. These women are rising up in defense of their children, their grandchildren and their way of life.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The majority of women believe the stimulus has failed to create jobs and have rejected both bailouts and so-called health care reform. For the first time since Gallup has tracked the issue, the federal budget deficit – now over a trillion dollars – has replaced the economy, the environment and Social Security as the issue that worries Americans the most when they think about how America will look 25 years from now.                
                

            
                Why doesn't Washington get it? The nation's economic and fiscal health directly impacts women. They comprise a majority of the workforce partly because the recession has disproportionately affected men and has left women shouldering the burden of employment and kitchen table economics. They are the ones making the majority of financial decisions for their families, including health care decisions, yet it is women who will be paying the high price.
Only one-quarter of women say their economic situation will “definitely improve” over the next few years, a shockingly dour number for Americans who generally project optimism on financial outlook.                
                

            
                Therefore, it’s no surprise that all kinds of women, from young mothers pushing strollers all the way up to grandmas in their wheelchairs, have been making their voices heard in political rallies all across the country. Women, and their kids, were also out in full force outside the U.S. Capitol on the day of the vote on the health care law loudly shouting, “kill the bill."" That energy will continue. Women make up a majority of voters in this year’s elections. The Tea Party, and politically engaged women generally, have flexed their electoral muscles in just a few states so far, including Virginia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and in Rand Paul's win last night in Kentucky. A majority of the electorate in each state was female and fiscal conservatives won all three elections.                
                

            
                But in addition to seeking out and voting for fiscal conservatives, women want members of Congress who make good on their promises. There is no room for hypocrisy. The political maneuvering of Arlen Specter screams of insincerity and was not lost on women.                
                

            
                Although in past elections women could be counted to support liberals (Obama carried them by 11 points in 2008), to put it lightly, women are now suffering from buyer’s remorse. Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker of the House has negative approval ratings and women see the corruption and lack of traditional values that Congress has allowed to run rampant – and they don't like it. Candidates offering voters both social and fiscal conservatism are winning elections. And even though it was a Democrat who won the late John Murtha's seat, Mark Critz ran as a pro-life, pro-gun and anti-tax conservative who said he opposed Obamacare, even though Murtha did not.                
                

            
                The economy already has driven women, and Tea Partiers, to the polls and will continue to do so come November. Voters are fed up with Washington arrogance, corruption and runaway spending. But it’s not just Republican women. A majority of all women, regardless of political affiliation, oppose using tax dollars to pay for abortions, which was included in the health care bill. And according to a recent poll from the Pew Research Center, majorities of Republican, Democratic and independent women all said that “frustrated” best describes how they feel about the federal government.                
                

            
                It is this frustration that is so evident at the polls. This year is most certainly the year of the woman activist. “Girl Talk 2010” is mostly about economic issues. Women, who are paying the bills, are also paying attention.

"Don't be fooled, Americans are starting to embrace ObamaCare","June 28, 2012: President Barack Obama speaks in the East Room of the White House in Washington after the Supreme Court ruled on his health care legislation. 
	                        
	                        	 (AP2012)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Watching President Obama's response to Thursday's Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of his health care reform law, I could not help but think how different things would be if he had given the same speech two years ago.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                He began his remarks from the White House by saying the Court had “reaffirmed a fundamental principle that here in America -- in the wealthiest nation on Earth -- no illness or accident should lead to any family's financial ruin.”                
                

            
                Reaffirmed?                 
                

            
                If you ask most Americans, they will tell you the president and his party never made that point in the first place. All the talk was about “Cornhusker Kickbacks” and “Chicago-style politics,” to win votes in Congress. GOP critics hammered the plan as a “big government takeover” and “socialism.”                
                

            
                But with last week’s Supreme Court ruling in favor of the health care plan public opinion on the plan is starting to become more favorable.                
                

            
                On Sunday Reuters released a poll showing 48 percent of registered voters now back the bill. That is up five percent since the ruling. That includes a bump in support among independent voters from 27 percent to 38 percent.  And even opposition among Republicans, who overwhelmingly hate it, went down five percentage points from 86 percent to 81 percent.                
                

            
                And those numbers are likely to keep rising. Also, GOP critics are now on the defensive. They have to talk about specific benefits in the law and how they could do better if they repeal the law.
 That is going to be hard for Republicans once Americans personally start reaping the benefit of the law.                
                

            
                Here are a couple of reasons why I say this:
 
 First, the parts of the president's health care law that have already been implemented are actually very popular. And Americans tell pollsters they don't want to see them taken away.                
                

            
                Clear majorities of people say they want insurance companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions, they want children to be able to stay on their parent's health insurance until they are 26 or find a job, they don't want insurance companies dropping people's coverage when they get sick or hiking up their premiums. If you poll senior citizens and ask them if they like saving money on their prescription drugs, they say they do.                
                

            
                Second, while it is not a majority there is still a significant percentage of Americans people who say they oppose the law because they think it doesn't go far enough. They wanted a public option or single payer.                
                

            
                For example, a New York Times/CBS News poll released in early June found that 37 percent of Americans believed the law went too far, while 27 percent said not far enough and 25 percent said about right.                
                

            
                When you delve deeper into the numbers 26 percent of those in opposition thought the law was about right or wanted the government to go even further – they wanted a Medicare type program to cover all Americans regardless of age.
 
 One of the main reasons for opposition to the bill was the mandate for everyone to have health insurance or pay a tax/penalty equal to cost of an insurance premium.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney understood the necessity of the individual mandate when he was governor of Massachusetts. That is why he made it the centerpiece of RomneyCare.                
                

            
                Though he disowned it during the 2012 GOP primaries, RomneyCare has been a monumental success. The Bay State currently has the best insurance coverage rate of any state in the union – with 100 percent of all children in the state covered and 98 percent of all residents.                
                

            
                The Obama campaign would be wise to point this out as they message their health care victory between now and November.                
                

            
                The Court’s decision also means that the other good provisions of the Affordable Care Act will be allowed to stand.                
                

            
                As the president pointed out in his speech, 13 million Americans or their employers who provide health insurance will be receiving a rebate check from their insurance companies this summer. The new law requires insurers to spend 80 percent of their money on insurance and not on administrative overhead and bonuses to their CEOs.                
                

            
                Seniors citizens will also receive a discount on their prescription drugs, which the president noted has already saved more than 5 million Medicare beneficiaries about $600 each. By 2020, the law will fully close the Medicare part D coverage gap – commonly known as ""the donut hole"" – saving seniors even more money.                
                

            
                Americans enrolled in Medicare Part C – or Medicare Advantage -- have seen their premiums lowered by 16 percent since 2010, giving seniors access to inexpensive, quality health care. Their premiums will continue to be lowered once the law is fully implemented.                
                

            
                People concerned about fraud in Medicare should also applaud the Court’s decision. Due to new enforcement powers given to the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare claims were stopped in 2011. This constitutes the largest sum ever recovered in a single year from individuals and companies attempting to defraud the American taxpayers. Look for a continued reduction in the incidence of Medicare fraud in the coming years.                
                

            
                Now that the president has demonstrated that he is willing to explain the benefits of the law to the American people, those numbers are pliable – they can be moved between now and the election.                
                

            
                Chief Justice John Roberts has not only given ObamaCare the imprimatur of constitutionality, he has given the president license to brag about his bill on the campaign trail.

"After Supporting ObamaCare, Has the American Medical Association Lost Its Way?","American Medical Association (AMA) president Cecil Wilson did a splendid job of revealing the true colors of the organization in his statements made at the recent House of Delegates meeting in Chicago.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                He stated that “no group other than the AMA speaks for doctors.” He also said that it is “shameful for doctors to oppose ObamaCare and to disagree with the AMA endorsement of it.                 
                

            
                His arrogance is stunning and shows how far out of touch the AMA is with the majority of doctors.                 
                

            
                Not surprisingly, their membership continues to dwindle and is down 12,000 paying members just this past year. Less than 17% of practicing physicians in America belong to the AMA, yet a fraction of these doctors agree with the policies and positions that come from the leadership of the organization.

During 2009, at the height of the health care reform debate, all of the stakeholders came to Washington with strong lobbying efforts on behalf of their constituents. All, that is, except for doctors.                 
                

            
                The American Hospital Association (AHA), America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), and Big Pharma all received concessions in exchange for their support of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).                 
                

            
                This was not the case with the “true voice of doctors” -- the AMA. They failed miserably when they had an opportunity to negotiate for issues important to doctors such as a permanent end to the Medicare SGR (“doc fix”) and tort reform.                 
                

            
                Instead, the AMA was a strong advocate for ObamaCare and got nothing in return for their constituents. In fact, a strong case can be made that the AMA was an accomplice to the successful passage of this law, because without their backing, the bill may have been in jeopardy. The question is: why did this happen?

Many people think that the AMA miscalculated, while others believe that they were just inept and simply outfoxed by clever politicians.                 
                

            
                Then there are some who question whether there may be a connection with the preservation of their government sanctioned monopoly over medical coding -- a system that all doctors and hospitals must use in order to get paid. This is a huge income stream for the organization --over $80 million annually--and allows it to stay afloat and financially strong at a time when revenue from paying members is dwindling.                 
                

            
                Looking for other income sources in lieu of membership dues, the AMA received an additional $47 million in 2009 by selling membership data to drug companies. This may be why they remained eerily silent when the prescription drug data mining case was heard by the US Supreme Court in May.

Another item that went mostly unnoticed was the recent appointment of James Madera as the CEO of the AMA. It is noteworthy that Dr. Madera has ties to the Obama White House, having worked with First Lady Michelle Obama and top presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett when he was CEO at the University of Chicago Medical Center and they were both on the board.                 
                

            
                He resigned his position amid controversy over a plan to redirect patients from the University to community hospitals -- a plan that was criticized by doctors at the hospital as well as the university president.                 
                

            
                More importantly regarding Dr. Madera, is the fact that he has been a lifelong academician who has more in common with hospitals than with doctors. In fact, the AHA praised his selection, and its spokesman, CEO Rich Umbdenstock thought that Dr. Madera would “provide the insight needed as the healthcare field continues to align and integrate.                 
                

            
                At a time when doctors are increasingly distrustful of the Obama administration and of hospitals with the prospect of ACOs (accountable care organizations) looming large, the AMA has selected as their CEO a man who has close ties to both groups -- not reassuring for doctors.

There are many doctors who had hoped that the 2011 AMA House of Delegates meeting would be an opportunity to reclaim the organization; to get them to repudiate ObamaCare. Instead, they resoundingly reaffirmed their support of it- specifically the individual mandate, which may yet be determined to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

Unfortunately, the AMA is too far gone to reclaim it. At this point, the patient (the AMA) is “terminal.”                 
                

            
                The shame lies not with doctors who disagree with the “official” positions that this organization takes, as Dr. Wilson would have people believe, but with him for having the temerity to deny the basic right of dissent to members of his profession who disagree with him and who believe that the AMA has betrayed doctors and patients.

"Time for Obama to Call In the Blue Hats, Declare Victory and Move On","AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The Obama administration has been hit with a swift boat-like attack on their health care plan. President Obama should do what George Bush should have done with Iraq, declare victory, call in the blue hats and go home.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                No, President Obama doesn't have the option of calling in the United Nations Blue Hats but he can find a health care plan that looks like it offers some reform, call it a victory for change and forget about it. Just like the Iraqi insurgency it is impossible to compete with the anti- heath care reform guerrilla warfare. It is also impossible to compete with the cascade of money being spent by the health care lobbies to stop a public option or other meaningful reforms.                
                

            
                According to The Center for Responsive Politics' Web site OpenSecrets.org the total amount of lobbying money spent in 2008 and 2009 by groups representing pharmaceutical/health products was a whopping $370,440,214. The insurance companies are responsible for $144,738,590. To put this in perspective, the amount spent lobbying would pay for nearly four years of the estimated full cost of the Obama health care plan. The lobbying groups have managed to spend that in less than two years!                
                

            
                Make no mistake there needs to be health care reform, there needs to be a way every citizen can purchase health insurance but it is not going to happen now and it is using up too much of the president's political capital.                 
                

            
                When he started on this issue the president had no idea how many sharks have been swimming in the health care waters and he must squeak out victory in order to get other parts of his agenda completed. Trying to avoid the Clinton-era health care fiasco he let Congress put forth a bill rather than having it come from the White House. That was probably a mistake. Creating some form of universal health care has been part of the Democratic Party platform since the 1948 convention. It is admirable that President Obama has tried but if five Democratic presidents have not been able to make it happen, it is doubtful that he will. My advice is for President Obama is to make some small meaningful reforms, do it quickly, declare victory and move on.

                President Obama and Democrats are just getting started on the argument that the Supreme Court is under control of a bunch of right-wing bullies.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Here are four high-profile, highly political cases with clear potential to advance the Democrats’ case by undermining the Supreme Court’s standing as an impartial, independent branch of government.                
                

            
                1) Health Care:                
                

            
                A Pew poll from last week found that 21 percent of Americans have a less favorable view of the Court after oral arguments in the health care case. Only 7 percent report a more favorable view. President Obama is just one among many Americans whose faith in the impartiality of the Supreme Court is waning because of the aggressive, ideological posturing by conservative members of the Court during the oral arguments.                
                

            
                At stake is the survival of President Obama’s health care reform act, specifically the individual mandate to purchase health insurance. Even staunchly conservative legal minds like Circuit Court Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Laurence Silberman have said the law is well within previous rulings of the court and defeating it amounts to judicial overreach. And, as the polls show, it is not just a few conservative judges who feel that way.                
                

            
                2) Affirmative Action:                
                

            
                The Court also will hear a case regarding the use of race in the admissions process at the University of Texas. In a 2003 decision involving the University of Michigan Law School, the Court held use of race as one factor among many in considering an applicant did not violate the 14th Amendment. By even agreeing to hear the Texas case, the Court has signaled a willingness to reconsider its previous decision. A reversal, coming so quickly, will be a break from the belief that judges should respect precedent -- which the conservative justices all claimed to support in their confirmation hearings.                
                

            
                3) Immigration:                
                

            
                In 2010, Arizona’s immigration law gave the police broad new powers to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally. A federal judge blocked the law and the Court will hear Arizona’s appeal this session. If the conservative majority overturns the previous ruling, the controversial law will be allowed to stand. This would give other states license to adopt similar politically controversial anti-immigration laws.                
                

            
                4) Voting Rights:                
                

            
                The court will decide if the Justice Department can use the 1965 Voting Rights Act as the basis for review of election laws in 16 mostly Southern states. These states have a history of racial discrimination and disenfranchisement of minorities. DOJ has used its power under the Voting Rights Act to block new voter identification laws in South Carolina and Texas’ new proposed redistricting map. Conservatives have never liked the power given to the federal government under the Voting Rights Act.                
                

            
                This case is extremely explosive at a time when the GOP is aggressively pushing voter identification laws that will depress the turnout of liberal-leaning young and minority voters -- likely voters for Democrats.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                According to polls, the overall level of public respect for the court is fading fast as it becomes just another venue for the polarized tug of war between liberals and conservatives. A January 2012 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 75 percent of Americans believe Supreme Court justices let their own ideological views influence their decisions, while only 17 percent think the justices decide cases based on legal analysis. The Gallup poll finds that public trust in the high court has declined from 50 percent 10 years ago to 37 percent today.                
                

            
                Starting with its unprecedented decision in Bush v. Gore -- where the Court effectively decided a presidential election in favor of Republican George W. Bush -- and followed by the Citizens United case opening the door to big money dominating campaigns, the Court is increasingly seen as just another manifestation of the right-left polarization that characterizes American politics in the 21st century. The image of the justices rising above politics is close to a historical artifact.                
                

            
                The reason is clear: The frequency of 5-4 decisions on hot-button political issues in recent years has caused many people to believe that justice is not blind to politics or the influence of money. That includes last week’s decision to allow Americans to be strip-searched after being taken into custody for even a minor crime.                
                

            
                When the Court decided Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Chief Justice Earl Warren made sure that the decision was unanimous. Segregation of public schools was such an extraordinary case that Warren knew that many Americans, especially in the South, would question the Court’s ruling if the decision split even 8-1.                
                

            
                For Warren, preserving respect for the institution was more important than the short-term ideological divides of the day. He even sent a draft of his opinion to the hospital bedside of Justice Robert Jackson to win his support.                
                

            
                Warren’s example is worth keeping in mind for Chief Justice Roberts as the court decides the current series of highly political cases this year. A series of 5-4 decisions on contentious political issues that are normally decided by legislatures could do irreparable harm to the Court’s already troubled reputation.

A Democrat's Take On Tuesday's Elections,"All eyes are turned toward Pennsylvania, Arkansas and Kentucky today. And when the votes are tallied at the end of the night, the message will be crystal clear: if you're an inside-the-Beltway candidate - no matter what party you call your own - watch out.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                There are of course unique circumstances at play in each race, but the underlying trend is the same: grassroots vs. Washington establishment. And in each example the Washington establishment is likely to come out on the losing end.                
                

            
                I've been asked a lot about my predictions for these races, so here goes:                
                

            
                Arkansas - Senate Democratic Primary                
                

            
                Blanche Lincoln has taken some major hits over the last several months: on her ""card check"" position and on health care reform to name just a few. And while she's been on the defensive, Lieutenant Governor Bill Halter has been able to position himself as the outsider candidate. Add D.C. Morrison into the mix we're likely to end up with a run-off between Lincoln & Halter that will drag out an already expensive and contentious race.                
                

            
                Kentucky - Senate Republican Primary                
                

            
                Rand Paul is predicting a ""Tea Party tidal wave"" to bring him to victory, and I have to say I agree with him to some extent. But the fact is, his likely victory has as much to do with the Tea Party as it does with the overall electorate's disgust with Washington. He has tapped into their frustration with insider politics. And he’s has mounted a major challenge to Secretary of State Trey Grayson who has the support of Sen. Mitch McConnell and the Republican party establishment.                
                

            
                Pennsylvania - Senate Democratic Primary                
                

            
                Arlen Specter – The five-term, former Republican Senator, who is backed by most of the Washington insiders despite his recent shift to the Democratic camp - is probably going to lose to Joe Sestak, who has successfully built a grassroots following that's sick of politics as usual. They are likely to drive turnout and propel Sestak to the nomination.                
                

            
                Pennsylvania – Special Election to Fill Rep. John Murtha’s Seat                
                

            
                The impact of this statewide contest is likely to be felt in the special election for Rep. John Murtha's seat as well. With such a dramatic contest for the Senate Democratic nomination and no real action statewide on the Republican side, Democratic candidate Mark Critz could benefit. Special elections normally see a low voter turnout, but with this one falling on the same day as a high-profile statewide primary, this is going to be an interesting one to watch.                
                

            
                In my opinion it's too close to call. But if Republican Tim Burns pulls out a Scott-Brown-esque victory despite the potential boost in Democratic turnout from the statewide contest, it's going to be another strong signal that 2010 is not only an anti-incumbent year, but a year that does not bode well for us Democrats. Like Kennedy in Massachusetts, Murtha held this seat for eons. And if the guy that Murtha's closest confidants and the Democratic establishment chose to be his heir loses today, it's going to have a very similar impact to Brown winning in Massachusetts.                
                

            
                At the end of the day I think the outcomes in all three states are going to drive home a message that the inside-the-Beltway crowd needs to hear loud and clear: start thinking beyond Washington and actually listen to what the voters are telling you.

"Now Will You Tackle Terror, Mr. President?","It was terrorism, stupid. And yes, the economy too. Polls showed that a majority of Americans who rejected Democratic Senate candidate Martha Coakley – who? – for Scott Brown, including voters in the deceptively bluer-than-blue state of Massachusetts, thought that President Obama had mishandled both.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                That’s not counting the mess the White House made of health care reform, with the help of the Congress, whom he tasked with drafting the package, another inane idea that most experienced politicians would have shunned. However important this issue is to most Americans, health care did not resonate as strongly in Massachusetts. That’s because most people in the state are already covered thanks to a generous state plan. Team Obama has so far satisfied few – not the left, which worked its heart out for him last year hoping for a new economic and foreign policy order, not, obviously, the right, which portrays him as an ideologically motivated, free-spending liberal intent on asserting government control of private industry, and not even the independent-minded center, an ever increasing segment of the voting, and non-voting public.                
                

            
                Mr. Obama’s main accomplishment to date, the $787 billion stimulus package, the size and content of which intensely fought over prior to its unveiling, has turned out to be too small, timid and beholden to the big banks and financial institutions to inspire public confidence. It has fostered a tepid jobless recovery that has not restored confidence in the nation’s economic or political institutions.                
                

            
                Now the president is being inundated with solicited and unsolicited advice about how he should respond to the voter’s repudiation of his policies. There are at least three options being promoted:                 
                

            
                First is the ostrich strategy: pretend that Massachusetts is an outlier and proceed full steam ahead with the muddled policies that have puzzled and/or infuriated so many of those who initially supported him.                 
                

            
                Second, play to the Democratic party’s base. Seize the populist ground that the tea-partyers have so ably claimed and rail against special interests and politics as usual in Washington.                 
                

            
                Third, take the advice of some conservatives and liberals alike – from columnist Peggy Noonan, who wrote Reagan’s best speeches, to Democratic pollster Doug Schoen and Democratic activist Lanny Davis -- listen to the people. Adjust course now or face an electoral tsunami this November.                 
                

            
                Since Tuesday's disaster for the Democrats, Obama seems to be pursuing a little of all three courses, lashing out of the banks with Paul Volcker at his side, assailing the Supreme Court decision to remove limits on corporate campaign spending, while quietly acknowledging that the health care bill he promoted, is for the moment, dead in the water.                
                

            
                Obama may now have to confront a basic problem. As E.J. Dionne observed in The Washington Post on Friday, Massachusetts exposed the “core contradictions” in the promises Obama made to American voters in 2008. In Massachusetts, his “commitment to sweeping change” was pitted against his “soothing pragmatism” and disdain for divisive, polarizing public fights. People were frustrated and confused. Scott Brown’s victory was the result. Dionne now wants the president to come out swinging.                
                

            
                But a Senate staff veteran, Janice O’Connell, now a senior vice president of the Gephardt Group, the Washington based, heavily Democratic consulting firm, thinks that the politics of the House and Senate leave him little choice: if Obama wants to accomplish anything, “he will have to figure out a new game plan, one that involves more compromise with Republicans.”                
                

            
                That means that health care reform now may not be feasible. But progress is possible on other fronts, especially on the economy and national security. Some Republicans and self-declared independents like Scott Brown may be willing to work with him on efforts to revitalize the economy and secure the nation against terrorism. In fact, independents like Brown will be looking for ways to polish their newly claimed “independent” status.                
                

            
                It was Obama’s misfortune that the Christmas underpants bomber reminded the people of Massachusetts of the terrorist threat that had not been a priority even six months ago. Having been reminded, however, Obama must get his national security act in order.                 
                

            
                For instance, there is no rush to close Gitmo, only to reestablish an expensive new “Gitmo north” in Illinois. Rename the place. Or take in Haitian survivors at the naval base. Nor should Obama send Gitmo’s Yemeni residents home any time soon, given the unrest and political temptations in their homeland. He should tell Dennis Blair, his director of national intelligence, to start connecting those dots, and order his FBI and Justice Department to create those “high-value interrogation teams” he vowed to create months ago to ensure that suspects in terrorism cases will finally be questioned by terrorism experts. And he can move trials of high-value- detainees to military commissions, or at least out of lower Manhattan and the shadow of the still undeveloped World Trade Center site.                
                

            
                The potentially good news for Obama is that despite growing doubts about his leadership style and course, polls show that he personally remains relatively popular. It’s his policies and “direction” people don’t like. Finally, polls show that Americans want him to succeed. He dare not squander more of that good will in the challenging months ahead.

"Wake Up, Media, Pelosi's Lying About Tea Parties","Nancy Pelosi is lying. OK, maybe that’s not a revelation. As a politician, the mere fact that she continues to breathe means she’s lying at least some of the time. You can tell politicians are lying in the United States when they have a letter after their name such as “D,” “R” or “I.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But Feb. 28 brought out a falsehood that would impress even tall tale-telling fishermen. House Speaker Nancy Graceless had the audacity to tell ABC’s Elizabeth Vargas that she has common ground with the tea party movement.                
                

            
                This from the very same politician who only recently bashed tea partiers for “carrying swastikas and symbols like that to a town meeting on health care.” Then she claimed the tea parties were “Astroturf” or phony grassroots. Now she’s trying to talk herself out of that one by claiming what they do “in some respects it is” Astroturf.                
                

            
                Her new tune is to blame it on those evil Republicans, claiming “the Republican Party directs a lot of what the Tea Party does, but not everybody in the Tea Party takes direction from the Republican Party.”                
                

            
                “But, you know, we share some of the views of the Tea Partiers in terms of the role of special interest in Washington, D.C., as – it just has to stop,” Pelosi lied. Yes, lied. When politicians lie and there’s a “D” after their names, the news media are as silent as former Democrat presidential candidate John Edwards was about his affairs and love child.                
                

            
                The same is true here. After the initial ABC interview, the network news media have ignored this entirely bogus claim. And Pelosi continues to be interviewed like nothing happened. Heck, that whopper was so big it’s amazing Burger King didn’t get an endorsement deal.                
                

            
                Scarily though, she wasn’t done. Pelosi then rambled on saying “special interests” bother both her and “many tea partiers.” Where’s Rep. Joe Wilson when you need him?                
                

            
                We don’t need Joe to say it ain’t so. We have Opensecrets.org to comment on Pelosi’s career fund-raising. Since 1989, she has brought in more than $11 million to run her campaigns. That’s roughly a dollar per minute … for 21 years.                
                

            
                Of course, Nancy “I Oppose Special Interests” Pelosi never took a dime from such entities. Actually, I doubt she did take a dime. Her support’s not that inexpensive. Dollars, yes. And it’s all the big donors liberals love – lawyers ($778,225), health professionals who might have an agenda on health care reform ($597,500), Wall Street ($589,450). Then there are the unions. Fifteen of her top 20 contributors are union groups. That 15 alone add up to almost $1 million. Overall, labor’s got $2 million in hooks into her – and that’s everybody from the AFL-CIO to the Teamsters.                
                

            
                But she’s still a friend to the common man, to the tea party movement.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, they’re not feeling the love. At the recent CPAC gathering in Washington this year -- a meeting of traditional conservatives and tea party attendees -- someone created a Nancy Pelosi piñata. Not exactly how you treat your friends – even in Washington.                
                

            
                An article in the New York Times on Feb. 7 that reported on a tea party meeting made it clear the attendees were fighting against Pelosi. After hearing how one group was going to battle against Sen. Harry Reid’s reelection campaign an attendee said “you need to come to California and help us defeat Nancy Pelosi.” Another guest at that event was incensed by Pelosi’s previous Nazi comments. One tea party protester explained why that was so unacceptable. “My grandfather's family, as Polish Jews, escaped Nazism. To call us Nazis is an abomination.” He shouldn’t be so sensitive. Friends always call each other Nazis. It’s like a pet name.                
                

            
                A different article in The Washington Post, on Nov. 6, 2009, demonstrated a similar anti-Pelosi sentiment from the tea party movement. According to the paper, “an estimated 10,000 conservative activists descended on Capitol Hill” “to defeat a bill they demonized as ""PelosiCare.” “Stop Pelosi's madness!” they chanted.                
                

            
                And back in August, Pelosi, along with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, (D-Md.), penned a column bashing the “ugly campaign” against health care in town hall meetings across the United States. Those meetings weren’t “civil” enough for Pelosi who seems intent on forcing national health care on an unreceptive public. Doing that is OK. Just don’t dare complain about it.                
                

            
                Ordinary voters know Pelosi isn’t one of them. To see her lie and try to pretend that she is shows the desperation taking hold on the left. Whether liberals are attacking the tea parties, trying to assimilate their supporters or battling with them through their new “coffee party” movement, they are scared. The left has never truly liked the idea of grassroots politics, especially when those roots reach deep into conservative views.

"March Madness -- Obama Fills Out NCAA Bracket But Is Missing In Action on Japan, Libya and the Budget","Since taking office, President Barack Obama has come under fire for ducking during some of the most serious times in his tenure. From his late in the game responses to the crisis in Libya to the Fort Hood shooter and the Christmas Day bomber, to his hands off approach on the health care reform bill to the federal budget Obama has been missing in action or worse. At times he has simply outsourced some of the most sensitive issues of his presidency, matters that belong in the Oval Office, to his allies on the Hill or in his administration.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Just yesterday, Republicans used the passage of a three-week spending bill in the House to ramp up pressure on Democrats and the president, saying he has “yet to truly weigh in” on the budget.                 
                

            
                Meanwhile, he and his Party refused to pass a budget last year. That's why Congress is forced to keep the government funded in temporary fits and starts. He also took a powder when it came to tackling out of control entitlements and instead let Republicans go first.                
                

            
                Even some in his party have asked him to lead on the budget, like Harry Reid did early this month. Even first term Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) accused President Obama of failing to lead.                
                

            
                To make matters worse, the president was seen golfing this weekend – the second one in a row – in the middle of the crisis in the Middle East, and as Japan tried to pick up the pieces from a giant earthquake and damaging tsunami. Instead of broadcasting his weekly radio address on any of the stern and sobering problems facing our nation and the globe, the president picked equal pay as the subject of his speech.                
                

            
                Then, amidst the criticism that he was disengaged, he decided to invite ESPN to the White House so he could publicly select his March Madness brackets, not exactly the chart topper of presidential priorities.                
                

            
                So is President Obama tone deaf, or is it that he really doesn’t care?                
                

            
                It’s more likely that he simply doesn’t know what to do. The president is simply out of his league, and it’s causing his administration to send mixed messages on everything from Egypt to Israel to energy policy.                
                

            
                This is most evident in his handling of the Libyan crisis, where he has called for Gaddafi to step down, but has not endorsed a no-fly zone or clearly explained the US’s position. During a press conference last week, Obama said he was “deeply concerned” that Gaddafi was gaining ground. Intelligence officer James Clapper also acknowledged that he believed Gaddafi ultimately might prevail. In the meantime, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) sent forces into Bahrain on Monday at the invitation of the government.
So what is the US going to do? The world is waiting for President Obama.
Sadly, he only speaks up when it affects his base or his re-election campaign, like in the mosque controversy at Ground Zero or when unions’ collective bargaining rights were on the chopping block in Wisconsin.
What we are witnessing is a profound indication of leadership paralysis. Obama does not know what to say on all fronts. He has no roadmap on fiscal issues, a national energy plan and gas prices, or the Middle East. He is not guided by US interests or any discernable strategy. His only goal is moral preening and making amorphous statements that make him sound like the most righteous man in the room.
The public is starting to notice as our country’s problems seem to become more evident. According to Gallup, his approval rating hit its lowest level since mid December – 46%.
If he has any hope of re-election, or if more importantly, he hopes to solve our challenges, the President needs to forget his basketball picks and focus on the real March madness happening at home and abroad. Sadly, though, leadership is not a trait found in the faculty lounge."
Cain vs. Obama In 2012 -- It's Not Just a Fantasy,"As Herman Cain’s long shot campaign to become the GOP’s first black presidential nominee continues to gain in the polls he is writing a one-of a-kind Hollywood fantasy. What if both candidates for the White House in 2012, Republican and Democrat, are black?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                And what happens to American politics if a black Republican wins the White House by winning the black vote?                
                

            
                Until now this movie seemed far-fetched. It fit in the same make-believe movie fiction genre as Jimmy Stewart being saved by an angel in the classic make-believe film “It’s a Wonderful Life.”                
                

            
                But since Cain handily won the Florida Republican Party’s straw poll this movie is pushing toward reality.                
                

            
                The latest Fox News national poll puts Cain in a strong third place position in the GOP race. He is statistically tied with Texas Governor Rick Perry for second place. He turned in a great performance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Friday night and has been all over cable news capitalizing on his surge. His new book, “This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House” hits stores this week.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney remains the frontrunner but his campaign seems stuck at about 25 percent of the vote.                 
                

            
                Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann hoped to become the conservative, Tea Party alternative to Romney but they have both faded in the last month.                
                

            
                Meanwhile Cain, the most dynamic speaker of all the candidates, continues to exceed expectations. He has been doing the hard work of organizing and meeting voters in the early states. He seems to be having some staff problems but if he can pull in some big money contributions to combine with his momentum he may be on his way to the nomination.                
                

            
                It is certainly a mistake to dismiss Cain -- as Sarah Palin did last week -- as just “the next flavor of the week.” To be completely fair Palin later said she did not mean to dismiss him as a fluke who will soon return to the bottom of the pack. She said her real target was mainstream media culture that fixates on one candidate only to immediately tear them down. She is right about that – but that’s another column for another day.                
                

            
                In fact, I have said that Cain’s victory in Florida owes a lot to conservative discontent with Perry and Romney. I think he is getting a lot of protest votes.                 
                

            
                But GOP voters I met in Florida last week scolded me and said they support him because he is a real conservative, an inspiring person with an economic plan they understand and experience as a businessman.                 
                

            
                It's safe to say that no matter where this movie goes from here Cain has already flipped the script on the standard racial dialogue in American politics. That happened with his very real and very powerful attacks on the liberal black establishment.                
                

            
                Cain said if he is the GOP’s presidential candidate in 2012 he will win a third of the black vote and end the liberal Democratic hold on black politics. And he said he will do that in a contest against a black Democrat – President Obama.                
                

            
                Cain stuck the knife into black liberals even deeper when he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN:                 
                

            
                “Many African-Americans have been brainwashed into not being open minded, not even considering a [black] conservative point of view. I have received some that same vitriol simply because I am running for the Republican nomination as a conservative. It is just brainwashing and people not being open minded, pure and simple.”                
                

            
                On Fox News Cain added that black voters in Atlanta, his hometown, constantly come up to him and begin whispering. They say they like him and his conservative positions. This happens so often he has started asking them why they are whispering. The answer is that black people fear being ostracized by other black people because they support a conservative – even if he is black.                
                

            
                Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" last week Cain said:                 
                

            
                “Anecdotally I run into people all the time and I share my 9-9-9 plan with them. Some black people that I run into – not all –… they won’t even take my little 9-9-9 brochure because [they hear that] I am that conservative, I’m that Republican. I call that being brainwashed. How can they make up their mind against something when they don’t know what it is?”                
                

            
                Cain’s bold comments drew heavy return fire from black leaders on the left. A clearly threatened Rev. Jesse Jackson called Cain’s words “demeaning and insulting” to black people. Jackson said black Americans can think for themselves and see Cain’s conservative positions on the minimum wage and health care reform are not in their political best interest.                
                

            
                Democratic Strategist Cornell Belcher called it a “racist, bigoted statement.” He said if a candidate said Jewish voters were “brainwashed” on the subject of Israel that candidate would be called a bigot and banned from TV.                
                

            
                Cain dismissed the backlash as the predictable retort from a crowd of black liberal Democrat politicians who fear losing their monopoly on black voters. And he issued more fighting words when he said his comments were “not as insensitive as the president of the United States standing in front of a major black audience, the Congressional Black Caucus, and scolding them because his policies have failed the country, his policies have failed black people.”                
                

            
                “That's more insensitive -- that's more insulting to me than me using a term brainwashed. It's their only weapon… to try to silence me because I'm a conservative. It's simply not going to work” he added.                
                

            
                Good for Herman Cain.                
                

            
                Whenever the mainstream media wants to know what the African American community is thinking, they invariably go to the usual liberal voices, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, as if they speak for all black people.                
                

            
                Brilliant black conservative voices are viewed as tokens and inauthentic. That ranges from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to former transportation Secretary William Coleman, former Housing Secretary Al Jackson, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, author Thomas Sowell, Professor Walter E. Williams and businessman Herman Cain.                
                

            
                After a while, the idea that the GOP will never be able to win back the black vote has become a self fulfilling prophecy. For the last several decades even Republican candidates have given up and not put money into winning the black vote.                
                

            
                It didn’t always used to be that way. In 1956, Republican Dwight Eisenhower won almost 40% of the black vote. Four years later, Richard Nixon won 32% of the vote. The first African American Senator elected by popular vote was a Republican - Ed Brooke of Massachusetts                
                

            
                Cain is a self-made, successful businessman, a radio talk show host and a cancer survivor. But he is also a Baptist preacher and a graduate of Morehouse College, an elite and famous black college. Unlike Barack Obama, his ancestors are slaves who lived through Jim Crow segregation. Don’t forget that four years ago the majority of the Congressional Black Caucus was lined up to support Hillary Clinton.                
                

            
                I do not agree with Herman Cain on many policy issues. For instance, economists both conservatives and liberal agree his 9-9-9 plan will lead to higher tax bills for the middle class and the poor.                
                

            
                But how do you think older black people will vote if they are asked to pick between Cain and Obama. One is a black businessman, preacher and a Southerner and the other is a bi-racial, Ivy League graduate who rarely goes to church, has fewer blacks in his cabinet than George W. Bush and who supports gay rights.                
                

            
                After this week, it is no longer outside the realm of possibilities that the Party of Lincoln will choose a black Republican as their standard bearer to defeat the first black president. Now that’s a blockbuster!

"President Obama, if you'll take on insider trading will you also deal with crony capitalism?","FILE -- Jan. 24, 2013: President Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Capitol Hill, as Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner, right, applaud.

                Dear President Obama,                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I watched your State of the Union address on Tuesday night and I want to welcome you aboard the reform train. You had some pointed things to say about congressional insider trading, which was a center point of my book ""Throw Them All Out"" which was published last November.                 
                

            
                I laid out how former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was getting rich off of stock IPOs and how her predecessor Dennis Hastert had a sweetheart land deal that included earmarks to build a highway near some land he bought.                 
                

            
                ""60 Minutes"" did a great story on the book in mid-November.                 
                

            
                Hastert wouldn’t talk to them.                 
                

            
                Pelosi probably wishes she hadn’t. She looked petrified as Steve Kroft was grilling her.                 
                

            
                My advice to politicians in Washington is this: if ""60 Minutes"" shows up at one of your press conferences, it's probably not a good idea to let them ask you a question.                
                

            
                I described the flurry of stock trades that people on both sides of the aisle were making while they were crafting and debating your health care reform legislation (ObamaCare) in 2009.                 
                

            
                And I disclosed how Congressman Spencer Bachus of Alabama actually bought stock options to short the market after he got a private briefing from the Fed Reserve chairman and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner during the financial crisis.                 
                

            
                From where you were standing, can you tell me if any of these people stood and applauded when you called for a ban on insider trading? I can’t tell from the video.                
                

            
                I imagine that you (or more accurately your staff) read at least some of the chapters. Your two proposed solutions to the problem came straight out of the last chapter in my book.                 
                

            
                For example, you called for making congressional insider trading illegal (which I mention on page 174) as well as preventing members of congress from trading stock in companies that fall under the purview of their committees.                 
                

            
                I also proposed that legislation on page 174. Glad to know you think these are good ideas.                
                

            
                I subscribe to Ronald Reagan’s philosophy, “It’s amazing what you can get accomplished so long as you don’t worry about who gets the credit.” So as long as real reforms get passed, I don’t care who gets the credit.                 
                

            
                Although I must say that some analysts are now trying to co-opt this issue.                 
                

            
                I did find it quite funny as I listened to MSNBC's Chris Matthews in his post-speech analysis say about this problem, “I have never heard any reference to it before in my life.”                 
                

            
                Is he living in a bubble?                 
                

            
                I guess he doesn’t watch ""60 Minutes,"" Fox News, or even programming on his own network! All of these media outlets did extensive coverage on the book. Or maybe he didn't read Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, etc. all of these publications wrote about it.                
                

            
                My hope, Mr. President is that congressional leaders of both parties will get these reforms done as quickly as possible so that we can prevent members of congress from enriching themselves in this way.                
                

            
                I must say, however, I was disappointed that you called for reforming Congress, but not your administration.                 
                

            
                In my book I point out that crony capitalism is a problem in the executive branch, too. (Maybe you skimmed over this part of the book?) In the State of Union address you continued to push government programs for green energy.                 
                

            
                But in Chapter 5 of ""Throw Them All Out,"" I demonstrated in great detail how your Department of Energy sent most of this money to wealthy individuals who funded your campaign in 2008.                 
                

            
                I found at least 10 members of your national finance committee and at least a dozen bundlers who got sweetheart deals. (You can find the names in my book on pages 88, 100-1. I’m sure these names will be familiar to you. They are the same people who are currently raising money for your reelection.)                
                

            
                Yes, it’s good that you took on congressional insider trading. Thank you for doing so. But why not also deal with crony capitalism in your administration? I hope you are not going to use this push for reform just to score political points.

Sincerely,

Congress Thumbs Its Nose at America,"When Republican members of the House of Representatives put forward a resolution to force Democrats to reveal their true intentions on the abortion provisions offered in HR 3590, Michigan Democrat Bart Stupak stood and angrily chided the minority for doing so.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                To no surprise his Democratic colleagues stood and applauded him as he claimed he, and his party alone, had fought for the protection of life in the health care legislation.                
                

            
                After his flip-flop and the thin, flimsy ""executive order"" that he ""secured"" with President Obama earlier in the day, Stupak should lose his seat in 2010. He deserves to. For only a moron or a liar would claim that an ""executive order"" could protect any intent of a piece of legislation.                 
                

            
                Executive orders are undone, and redone with nearly every election cycle, and once tax payer-funded abortion becomes part of the federal budget by statute, the most ardent pro-abortion, public official ever elected, Barack Obama, will tear up that executive order and toss it aside.                
                

            
                Stupak's primary opponent for 2010 had already added more than 9,000 new Facebook friends by the time his angry tirade had come to its conclusion on the House floor. In addition the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony's List revoked an award they were to present to the Michigan congressman next week for his attempt to keep federal funds from being allocated toward abortions.                
                

            
                But Stupak was just the latest betrayal.                
                

            
                On Sunday night, RNC Chairman Michael Steele announced on Fox News Channel's ""At Large"" broadcast a new initiative at GOP.com to raise money in the attempt to ""fire"" Nancy Pelosi for her betrayal and dishonesty in forcing upon the American people a health care plan that every poll in America shows they do not want.                
                

            
                Shortly after his announcement GOP.com's servers crashed from the crush of traffic.                
                

            
                It should also be noted that the true ""bipartisan"" path in this legislative initiative was the ""no"" vote. Thirty-four Democrats crossed party lines to oppose Obamacare, joining 177 Republican members of the House.                
                

            
                So what does it mean?                
                

            
                To be honest we still don't know. The Senate is still has to vote on the ""fixes"" the House wants in the bill and until they do the ""Cornhusker kickback,"" ""the Louisiana purchase,"" ""Gator Aid"" and tons of other graft will be the law of the land. The president, however, is planning to sign the bill on Tuesday.                 
                

            
                The moment that happens 37 states attorneys general are ready file challenges to the mandate of this federal law requiring individual citizens to purchase health care. (Which should go over really well if it works its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, given the president's overly respectful treatment of the nation's highest court.)                
                

            
                The president's plan was to get Obamacare passed and next he wants to begin to try to convince Americans that $2.4 trillion in spending, massively increased deficits (when the doctor fix is added in, and all the numerous double counting is removed), massively hiked taxes--up to $22,000 more per family, is in some way good for them. He wants them to believe this while unemployment continues to hover at nearly 10% nationally, and nearly one in five families is already not making enough to pay their bills.                
                

            
                Senator Coburn promised to reveal every kickback given in exchange for votes, and the narrative in Minority Leader Boehner's closing remarks were powerful. He implied Congress was broken, and that voters had the right to be angry.                
                

            
                But one thing became clear as the weekend drew to a close. -- President Obama put down a great wager on health care reform, a bet that is as high as the stakes can be played in Washington.                   
                

            
                Congress played their part dutifully, by flipping voters a figurative middle finger, voting for the health reform package, and pretending that they had not actually bankrupted the future economic system of this nation.                
                

            
                It's fundamental transformation. And it's against the will of the people.                
                

            
                Yep, 2010 just got a whole lot more interesting!

Are Republicans Secretly Trying to Get President Obama Re-Elected?,"Are Republicans in the House secretly working for David Axelrod’s Committee to Re-Elect President Obama?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The hidden hand of Axelrod, the man leading the President’s re-election campaign, is the only explanation for the GOP’s dismaying performance so far. Day after day the Republicans provide voters with an on-going series of empty political gestures topped off by embarrassing fights between Tea Party loyalists and the Republican leadership.                
                

            
                Axelrod’s evil intent must be to get the voting public that last fall rejected the Democratic control of the House to reconsider. That Democratic majority is looking better than ever because the first six weeks of the Republican majority looks so bad.                
                

            
                Last week the Republican leadership called for a vote on renewing the Patriot Act. But Republicans did not have the votes to pass it. In fact 26 Republicans voted with Democrats to oppose it. The bill was passed this week but the embarrassing civil war inside the GOP ranks remains the big news.                
                

            
                That dismaying performance was followed by a failed vote to reclaim funding for the United Nations. New York Republican Peter King led the opposition to that bill. And then there was the failure to pass important adjustments to trade agreements with South American nations.                
                

            
                The Republicans vote to repeal President Obama’s healthcare legislation also went nowhere. No amendments allowed, no effort was made to correct any of the flaws of the bill, and there was no sign of any serious outreach to conservative Democrats who share Republican concerns. As a result the House repeal vote got no traction in the Senate. The final result was only to pander to anger in the Republican base.                
                

            
                A Pew poll done last week found “far more” Americans blaming Republicans than President Obama [31-19] for “not working together on the important issues facing the country.” That is the same as a year ago when Democrats ran the House. Even with Republicans in charge they have not gained public support in their battle with President Obama.                
                

            
                This week the GOP promised a new strategy to follow up on the futile repeal vote. They planned to vote to defund the health care bill.  But the House Rules Committee, with eight Republicans and only four Democrats, had to tell Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, that it is against the rules to use a spending bill to subvert legislation. Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina pleaded with King to stop the charade: “Please, please, please don’t do this.”                
                

            
                The latest Republican plan to undercut health care reform is to amend the spending bill for the current year.  Again, it has no support in the Senate and will be vetoed by the President. This is all posturing. In fact, a CBS poll this week found 55 percent of Americans oppose the Republican efforts to defund health care.                
                

            
                Then Republicans put forward a proposal to “reduce non-security spending,” but did not specify how much spending would be cut or where to find the cuts.”                
                

            
                With their huge majority in the House, Republicans should have entered this week’s budget negotiations with strong momentum for meaningful cuts. Instead the focus has been on disagreement among Republicans about the amount of the budget cuts. The Tea Party freshman wanted $100 billion. The leadership was looking to force Democrats to negotiate by offering a reasonable proposal. Now it is back at $100 billion but the President and the nation have moved on to discuss next year’s budget. The serious discussion that Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin called for in his response to the State of the Union has been lost in the noise created by extreme members of the Republican caucus.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, Republicans have decided that despite past criticism for not focusing on jobs this is just the time to start another chapter in the polarizing debate on abortion. One bill tries to permanently ban taxpayer funding for abortions in federal programs. That is a curious proposal since there has been no federal funding of abortion since the Hyde Amendment of 1976.                
                

            
                Republican House Majority Leader, Eric Cantor, had to spend time telling reporters that neither of two the anti-abortion bills was scheduled for a vote. His only defense was to say that making a show of opposing abortion is “obviously very important in terms of the priorities we set out initially in our pledge to America.” In other words, this was another pointless exercise in pandering to the base.                  
                

            
                The Republican effort to re-elect Obama goes forward.

                Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and TheHill.com.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                 
                

            
                This Saturday marks President Trump’s 100th day in office.                
                

            
                On Day One, after listening to Trump’s inaugural address, former President George W. Bush reportedly said: “That was some weird s--t.”                
                

            
                The GOP establishment still holds that view after 100 days of President Trump.                
                

            
                And Democrats are also offering “We Told You So” looks to all who voted for Trump.                
                

            
                Trump’s most striking achievement in his first three months is being the least popular new president in modern history.                
                

            
                A majority of Americans – 52 percent — disapprove of his job performance as president, according to the most recent Gallup tracking poll, released Saturday.                
                

            
                Even Trump’s supporters have to admit these first three months have been defined by the administration’s failure to deliver on campaign promises.                
                

            
                For all of Trump’s talk about being a great dealmaker, the flashing lights on the political scoreboard read as follows:                
                

            
                No repeal of ObamaCare. No tax reform. No Muslim travel ban — in the sense that the attempt to enact one is bogged down in the courts — and no evidence to support the incredible claim that President Obama had Trump wiretapped.                
                

            
                There is also no wall on the southern border and no indication that Mexico will pay for it.                
                

            
                And in the last few weeks, the reversals on campaign promises have come thick and fast.                
                

            
                Now Trump approves of the Export-Import Bank. Now Trump is no longer a fan of the border adjustment tax. Now he believes in NATO. Now China will not be listed as a currency manipulator. Now Janet Yellen is a good chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.                
                

            
                Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) put all the flip-flops in delicate terms so as not to offend the Trump faithful:                
                

            
                “I think President Trump is learning the job and some of the things that were said during the campaign I think he now knows — that’s simply not the way things ought to be.”                
                

            
                Trump’s singular success was getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court.                
                

            
                But the credit for that win should properly go to the Heritage Foundation and the conservative legal minds at the Federalist Society. They compiled a list of their favorite conservative judges and handed it to Trump.                
                

            
                Now, let’s look ahead to Trump’s next 100 days.                
                

            
                The biggest threat to Trump is the split between him and Republicans in Congress.                
                

            
                He has proven to be a weight on Republican congressional candidates in two special elections in Kansas and Georgia.                
                

            
                FiveThirtyEight forecaster Harry Enten tweeted earlier this month that the House GOP caucus is in the worst position of any party holding the House majority since 1954, when voters were first asked their preference for which party rules the House.                
                

            
                That ballot question was simply, “If the election were held today, would you vote for the Republican or the Democratic candidate?” Enten’s average of the polls has the Republicans down by six points.                
                

            
                There is more than a year for the Republicans to dig out from there, but it is a big hole.                
                

            
                That gives Republicans every reason to start distancing themselves from the Trump White House. Democrats are already standing far away.                
                

            
                Yet Trump needs Congress’s help right now to avoid a government shutdown.                
                

            
                After a two-week Easter recess, Congress returns to work tomorrow with just four days left until funding for current government operations is set to expire on April 29.                
                

            
                The top two Senate Republicans, McConnell and Majority Whip John Cornyn (Texas) are going out of their way to call for a bipartisan, stop-gap funding measure to stave off a shutdown.                
                

            
                “We’ll be talking to Senate Democrats,” McConnell said before Easter. “They will be relevant to the process. It will require 60 votes. I’m confident that Senate Democrats are not going to want to shut down the government.”                
                

            
                So now we have leading Republicans calling on President Trump to work with the Democrats.                
                

            
                But Democrats know that Trump’s plans for future budgets anger their base. So why would they help him?                
                

            
                The Trump blueprint for future budgets, released last month, outlined draconian cuts to funds that support popular education, social welfare and economic development programs. Meals on wheels for the elderly and afterschool programs for disadvantaged youths were two that invited public outcry.                
                

            
                Trump recently said he remains focused on health reform and is threatening to withhold subsidies to insurance companies to force Democrats to help him pass a bill to replace ObamaCare.                
                

            
                ""Health care [reform] is going to happen at some point,” the president told my Fox colleague Maria Bartiromo. “Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough, I'll start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first.""                
                

            
                If you are a Democrat who enjoyed the disastrous GOP civil war over their health care bill, then you are going to love the upcoming GOP slugfest over spending and taxes. If past is prologue then Trump will be frustrated, and fail to get his tax and spending plans passed by the splintered GOP Congress.                
                

            
                His biggest success will be in driving down the GOP’s poll numbers as the midterm elections get closer by the day.

ObamaCare and the 2012 Campaign,"There's no question that Thursday's ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance starting in 2014 is a short term victory for President Obama. That's simply undeniable.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The court's decision to uphold the individual mandate and almost all of the health care law is a much better outcome for the Administration politically than invalidation of all -- or even part -- of the law. Indeed, it comes at the end of an especially bad month for Obama and stems the bloodletting that has been going on for most of June.                
                

            
                But there's a downside in today's news for the White House and the president's 2012 reelection campaign.                
                

            
                Put simply, in the court of public opinion, polling has consistently shown that ObamaCare is a loser. ObamaCare was unpopular in 2010, remains unpopular now, and almost certainly be unpopular come November.                
                

            
                A new Associated Press-GfK poll found that the Affordable Care Act remains unpopular across-the-board -- and particularly among independent swing voters. Indeed, Just a third of Americans overall -- and only 21 percent of independents approve of the law, a new low in AP-GfK polling.                
                

            
                And today's Supreme Court ruling --, which established in no uncertain terms that ObamaCare is a TAX -- will not make the law more popular in the long term.                
                

            
                Indeed, it will mean that the legislation will now be explicitly seen in the context of higher taxes for hardworking Americans at a time of weakened economic conditions.                
                

            
                This means that going forward in the election campaign, it will be increasingly difficult for President Obama to defend an unpopular law at an unpopular time -- thus working to Republican challenger Mitt Romney's advantage.                
                

            
                What the President needs to do is something that he has been reluctant to do -- take on the issue of entitlement policy in the context of overall fiscal and budgetary reform.                
                

            
                He must position ObamaCare as the centerpiece of an overarching plan to address the issue of costs in a serious and sustained way, while simultaneously  facilitating economic growth and private sector job creation.                
                

            
                Moreover, he must put forth a comprehensive set of policy prescriptions to address the issues that the American people regard as fundamental, and a long-term economic agenda that emphasizes tax reform, fiscal prudence, and economic growth -- as well as the need to rein in entitlements, balance the budget, and reduce the debt and deficit.                
                

            
                To that end, he can talk about ObamaCare in a manner that emphasizes cost containment and innovation, within the context of fiscal discipline and budgetary restraint -- specifically referencing the work of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform -- a bipartisan commission chaired by former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and former chief of staff in the Clinton White House, Erskine Bowles.                
                

            
                For his part, Mitt Romney will almost certainly say that his first act if elected President will be repealing ObamaCare, and continue to attack the higher taxes and the impact on health care costs that will surely result.                
                

            
                And in the short-term this makes sense.                
                

            
                But with Mitt Romney's own favorability  ratings remaining low and a new round of polling showing Obama holding a consistent advantage in key swing states -- it is a strategy with limited upsides.                
                

            
                Governor Romney, too, has to articulate a vision for comprehensive health care reform.                
                

            
                Put simply, in the absence of a clear set of core principles, and a plan to balance the budget, create jobs and a smart, reasonable, and rational discussion about health care and a health care policy that takes steps to rein in excesses in the system, his hopes for winning the White House come November -- a goal that is well within reach -- could be dashed."
"Selective Outrage, Bogus Claims of Violence Used Against Tea Parties","It’s obvious journalists think the tea partiers are a dangerous, racist, homophobic bunch of loons. It’s not just wacky MSNBC or the liberal Washington Post spreading this garbage. It’s nearly every major news outlet. Behind them, pulling the strings like Geppetto, is the core of the liberal movement – “progressive” websites, lefty personalities and Democratic politicians all making the same claim.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                They are all wrong. In some cases, they are openly lying. In most cases, they are taking hypocrisy to epic levels.                
                

            
                First of all, claims that the tea party movement is made up of dangerous “extremists” are disproven automatically by events. Tea party groups have been around more than a year throwing hundreds or even thousands of protest rallies. Yet, less violence has actually occurred than you might see at an NFL game between rival fans.                
                

            
                Yet, the theme of Tea Party-violence is everywhere. It even led to claims that former Gov. Sarah Palin’s, R-Alaska, used a ""threatening"" political strategy map. That map was made to take ""aim"" at 20 congressional races, using crosshairs. Critics were upset by the use of crosshairs to indicate each race. It’s as if the media expect us to forget that journalists use “target” and “aim” in stories all the time or that we live in a nation where 1,740 stores operate under the “Target” name and use a bullseye as a logo. But the media combined Palin's map with Palin’s use of the word “reload” to paint her as a member of the fringe element.                
                

            
                New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called out Palin because he’s afraid of his shadow: “And Sarah Palin put out a map literally putting Democratic lawmakers in the cross hairs of a rifle sight.” MSNBC called it a “Dem Hit-list.”                
                

            
                Reporters could have found a much scarier quote from the campaign, like this one from a Philadelphia visit in 2008: “If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.” Now that sounds threatening – except it wasn’t Palin or even Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. who said it. That's what then-senator, now-President Obama said on the campaign trail. But because it didn’t fit the media's theme, it was disregarded.                
                

            
                There are ample examples of scary left-wing comments and even left-wing violence. There are countless online instances of liberals calling for Bush’s assassination when he was president – photos of Bush with a target drawn on his photo. O,r even the movie “Death of a President,” which was made about his assassination. I guess that was all in good humor and high art along with the 6.3 million links Google finds connecting Bush and Hitler. Now comparisons of Obama to Hitler are supposed to be over-the-top. Were journalists asleep during all the lefty hatred of Bush?                
                

            
                Then, there’s actual left-wing violence, like the violent protests during the 1999 World Trade Organization conference. The violence got so bad, the media named it “The Battle in Seattle.” There was also left-wing violence at the GOP 2008 convention, turning the event into an armed camp. And there were union thug tactics at the town halls. And former CNN host Lou Dobbs was threatened and a gun was shot at his home.                
                

            
                Any liberal claims to non-violence are long gone. Once you cut that string, all that remains is media's hand-wringing and selective outrage over a few incidents. That doesn’t excuse actual threats to congressmen. But the media act like such threats only come from the right when they don’t. For the best example, let’s take the darling of health care reform Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich. Stupak’s complaints about threats and nasty calls were aired in five broadcast news stories after he switched sides in the health care battle.                
                

            
                But before he was for health care reform, he was against it. The calls and threats that time were so intense, he had to disconnect his phone. Total broadcast news stories about that? Zero. Look back at what Stupak told The Hill. “All the phones are unplugged at our house — tired of the obscene calls and threats.” All because he opposed Obama and the Democrats.
Who exactly was making those phone calls? Republicans?                
                

            
                Then there are media complaints about what protesters have said. There’s no doubt out of millions of protesters, a few might have said something inappropriate. If the media treated left-wing protest with the same fine-tooth comb, they’d be shocked by the results. The Democrat's high-profile claims of bigotry and homophobia both don't hold water. Civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., made claims that he heard a racial comment during his trip to the Capitol. But several audio and video tapes don’t confirm it.                
                

            
                Then there were complaints about an anti-gay slur reportedly made to openly gay Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. This is particularly ludicrous because the media and Democratic members of Congress have been slurring the Tea Party movement with the gay “teabagger” comment for a year now.                
                

            
                The term ""teabagger"" excited lefties from alleged news personages, like Anderson Cooper, George Stephanopoulos and David Shuster, to Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, Calif., and Anthony Weiner, N.Y., to a parade of liberal talk show hosts like Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow. Maddow and guest Ana Marie Cox went so nutty, that they used the word “teabag” at least 51 times in a 13-minute long segment of juvenile “teabag” puns.                
                

            
                That’s the common left-wing and media response to ordinary Americans trying to get involved in their nation’s government – abuse and lots of it. After 14 months of a battle where critics were repeatedly demeaned, labeled as racists, told their anger was uncalled for and that their movement was “Astroturf,” or phony grassroots. It’s no wonder they are angry. This, after Democrats told taxpayers Congress might OK a bill without voting on it, though most Americans oppose the bill.                
                

            
                That doesn’t excuse someone threatening violence, or saying “I’m going to kill you.” But people say that all the time without really meaning it. Fans say it to referees, parents say it to children and brothers say it to brothers – all in the heat of anger. That, along with mountainous piles of hate mail, are part and parcel to work in D.C. for both sides.                
                

            
                No one should be threatened for serving this nation. But if Stupak, Frank and others can’t handle criticism and anger, then they are in the wrong business. And if the media can’t handle this war of words as referees, not players, then they should stay out of it entirely.

                Where in the world are the Clintons? The answer is as far away from Washington and President Obama as possible. The former president is winding down a successful trip to North Korea --  having secured a pardon for two U.S. journalists held there. However, both President Clinton and the Obama communications team have repeatedly made clear that this was a private humanitarian mission,not one where he represents the current president in any way.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Hillary Clinton has been dispatched on an 11 day trip to Africa, a region with severe humanitarian concerns that need to be addressed by the US, but not one that ranks in the top five of America's urgent foreign policy problems.                 
                

            
                With both Clintons out of the country, news agencies dubbed Tuesday, August 4, ""Obama Day."" -- Okay, it was also his birthday, but I cannot help but think that the Clintons are unhappy about being pushed away from the center of power, especially since both Bill and Hillary anticipated that theywould be them residing in the White House in August of 2009 and not the Obamas.                
                

            
                History quiz: Who was the last sitting president seriously challenged in a primary?                
                

            
                Answer: Jimmy Carter taken on by Ted Kennedy in 1980.                
                

            
                Fast forward 32 years and the possibility of a redux is becoming more and more real with each percentage point President Obama's rating slides.  Unlikely? At this stage, yes, but definitely possible and made more so by the circumstances.                
                

            
                Who? The answer is obvious; the same person who carried 1,973 delegates and 23 states and territories in the 2008 democratic primaries, who currently possesses substantial campaign funds and who, while supposedly pledging not to run in any more campaigns, has kept a staff larger than some Senators up for reelection in 2010 -- the current Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.                
                

            
                The same person whose husband, the only two-term Democrat president since FDR, was so ambiguous in his support for Barack Obama during last year's presidential election it was spoofed on NBC's Saturday Night Live:                
                

            
                Actor playing Larry King: ""President Clinton, do you endorse Barack Obama?""                
                

            
                Actor playing President Clinton: ""Barack Obama is my party's candidate for presidency, and I am not a party wrecker...I love to party!!!""                
                

            
                The truth is that President Clinton was willing to say anything to avoid clearly supporting a man he had, and likely continues to, disdain. The former president Clinton thinks Obama stole from Hillary something she deserves: the presidency.                
                

            
                Hillary Clinton herself has openly criticized President Obama, specifically the vetting process and the president's ability to fill the departments associated with her position as Secretary of State, such as the Agency for International Development. She has also been a very invisible Secretary of State, making it easy for her to step away at some point to prepare her candidacy.                
                

            
                Conventional thinking suggests that if Hillary Clinton wants a shot at the presidency she will wait until 2016, but she is an unconventional individual and these are not conventional times. The combination of the pressures of her age, she will be 69 in 2016 (she was born October 26, 1947), and the window which is becoming more and more open as the current president struggles in his domestic and foreign policy agenda, may make a 2012 run impossible to turn down for this politician who so longed to be her party's nominee she cried about it before the New Hampshire primary.                
                

            
                Any chance of Hillary 2012 goes out the window if two out of three of the following happen 1. healthcare reform is successful; 2. the economic crisis is handled effectively; and/or 3. the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq are resolved.  However, if the first six months of this presidency has taught us anything, it is to never overestimate the current administration, but to wait for the results. So far the results are stalled health care reform, a continuing economic crisis --notwithstanding the supposed ""stimulus"" bill -- and a significant upsurge in U.S. casualties in Afghanistan. The result is an approval rating for the president down in the low 50s on par with, that's right, Jimmy Carter's rating 32 years ago 6 months into his Presidency in late July 1977.

                Is there any way Democrats can win the 17 seats they need to capture the House majority this November?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In one word: Yes.                
                

            
                Democrats picked up 8 seats two years ago despite widespread predictions of losses. They lost 12 seats in 2012 by less than five percentage points and another 18 seats by less than 10 percentage points.                
                

            
                Also keep in mind that every poll shows the public agrees with Democrats on the big issues – gay marriage, pay equity for women, immigration, gun control and budget cuts.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, the GOP brand remains unpopular. The biggest advantage for House Democrats is that they are running against Republicans. That party’s good name suffered from last fall’s government shutdown, a strategy of obstruction that has paralyzed the Congress, and the recent vote in support of a budget that privatizes Medicare.                
                

            
                Another plus for Democrats is that the GOP’s misguided message to voters for the fall elections – “ObamaCare is a Failure.” That claim is out of date with the success of 7 million people enrolling and 3 million more gaining insurance through Medicaid expansion. The ‘kill health care reform’ message, with endless GOP votes in the House for repeal, also irritates swing voters. Polling shows Independents want to fix ObamaCare, not kill it.                
                

            
                But even with all those advantages the odds remain against Democrats getting enough wins to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the House. Top political analysts, from Charlie Cook to Larry Sabato, currently predict Republicans adding two or three seats to easily retain their majority.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                Even the chair of the Democratic Congressional Committee, New York’s Rep. Steve Israel, told the National Press Club in early April: “It’s a tough climate for us right now.”                
                

            
                In the 2012 House races, Democrats won 50.6 percent of America’s votes with a popular President Obama at the top of the ballot. Although they won the majority of votes they picked up only 8 seats, leaving them 17 shy of majority control. The Democrats’ voters are concentrated in blue states and even high turnout has minimal impact on Republican districts.                
                

            
                Another problem for Democrats this year is the absence of President Obama’s name on the ballot. His star power has a history of driving up voter turnout among core Democrats, young people, women and minorities. But his name is not on this year’s ballot. And after the bungling of the start of computer enrollment for health care the president’s support among Democrats slipped. It has slipped even more among Independent voters. That has caused the president’s popularity to drop into the mid-40 percent range. History is pretty clear here. Second-term incumbents almost always see their party lose seats, an average of 29.                
                

            
                Also bedeviling to Democrats are the results from polls asking voters if they prefer having Democrats or Republicans in charge of the House. Voters are about even, with Democrats holding only a slight, 41-39 percent edge, according to Real Clear Politics. That translates to political strategists as Democrats not having a strong political wind at their back as they sail into the election.                
                

            
                But let me offer the contrarian argument: There is still hope for Democrats to win the House majority!                
                

            
                First, the Democrats are lucky to be running against the House Republicans. Polls show the GOP has a measly 30 percent approval rating. House Republicans are even less popular with about an 18 percent approval rating, according to the most recent polls.                
                

            
                Democrats in the House have nearly twice the approval rating, at 30 percent in the same Quinnipiac poll.                
                

            
                Infighting between so-called ‘establishment Republicans’ and ‘Tea Party Republicans’ compounds the Republicans’ low favorability.  The party’s image is captive to incumbent Republican fears of not being sufficiently conservative to stave off a challenge from a Tea Party challenger in primary races. That’s why House Republicans just passed a budget with cuts to education and savings from making Medicare a private plan. Basically the House GOP, in their preoccupation with the far right, just handed Democrats a great weapon for beating up House Republicans in the fall races.                
                

            
                “The Republican budget [is going to] define the next seven months,” said DCCC chair Israel. “With this budget the Republicans are turning their back on the middle class.”                
                

            
                Another reason for the Democrats to have some optimism about House races is the retirement of several popular Republican incumbents and changing demographics. Here are two races that illustrate how holding the House majority may be more difficult for Republicans than the experts would have you believe.                
                

            
                When moderate Republican Jon Runyan, R-N.J., retired, he set off a chaotic fight between Tea Party and establishment Republicans in the district. The local Republican establishment candidate, Tom MacArthur, is battling for the nomination against Tea Party insurgent Steve Lonegan. Not only are they tearing each other up before the general election, but also both are vulnerable to charges of being carpetbaggers. Each man served as mayor of a New Jersey town outside the district. Aimee Belgard, a Democrat, is now positioned as an even pick to win a seat that previously looked safe for Republicans.                
                

            
                Then there is the demographic problem for Republicans. In Colorado’s 6th District, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman has seen a sharp increase among his Hispanic constituents. That rising tide led Coffman to back a bill to give legal status to children of illegal immigrants who are in school or join the military. But he is facing a formidable challenge from the former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives, Andrew Romanoff, who is telling voters about the GOP’s refusal to act on immigration reform.                
                

            
                Those races explain why no one should be surprised if Democrats find a way to chalk up some House wins this fall.

Not Your Grandmother’s Debt Ceiling Debate,"This is not your grandmother’s debt-ceiling debate. While the lid on government borrowings has been raised dozens of times since 1917, when it was first put in place in order to sell war bonds, the current scuffle is different for several reasons. First, the country’s fiscal prospects have never been darker, mainly because Medicare and Social Security payments will rise to unsustainable levels unless the programs are changed. Second, an increasing amount of U.S. debt is being sold overseas, making us vulnerable in ways not yet entirely clear. Third, we have a political force in the country – the Tea Party - that is committed to restraining government spending. For these reasons, the debate is more raucous and more threatening than ever before.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Normally, raising the lid on the country’s borrowings has been accomplished with little fanfare, though some have used the measure as an opportunity to sound fiscal alarm bells, and to score political points. (Ironically, then-Senator Obama weighed in during the 2006 debate with the following remarks: “The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure…It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government’s reckless fiscal policies… This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on.”)                
                

            
                He was right then, and his comments resound today. The country cannot continue to spend at today’s level – at about 25% of GDP, a level last seen during World War II – without crippling our future. Why not? Because outlays at that level cannot be funded by traditional means – taxes and other fees – without undermining the productivity of the nation. Therefore, such a level of spending demands increased borrowings, which in turn leads to a dangerous and suffocating debt level. The rise in obligations means that in several years we will be spending more on interest costs than on Medicare or on defense. That projection was included in the President’s budget, which forecasts that interest rates rise only modestly – almost surely an overly optimistic assumption. This dire outlook has led the ratings agencies – Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s – to threatened a downgrade of our debt, an unprecedented warning.                
                

            
                As we have increased our borrowings, we have turned to foreign lenders. In 2010, 47% of our debt was held by foreigners, up from 19% in 1990 and 5% in 1970. As of the end of May, China held $1.1 trillion in U.S. bonds and notes. Not only does this obligation threaten our balance of power with Beijing, it also makes us vulnerable to a “buyers’ strike.” If, for political reasons, China steps out of the market for any period of time, interest rates would surely rise.                
                

            
                This unprecedented financial insecurity accounts for Republicans’ “intransigence”, as President Obama has described it. GOP legislators are sticking to their guns – demanding serious spending cuts, all the while risking the fury of President Obama and, conceivably, of voters back home. They know the stakes have risen, and they don’t trust Democrats to meaningfully alter the dangerous fiscal path the country is currently traveling. They are quite right to be skeptical. In 1990 President George H.W. Bush caved into raising the debt ceiling with the understanding that Democrats in Congress would cut spending by $2 for every $1 hike in taxes. Bush raised taxes by $137 billion; instead of slicing baseline spending by the agreed $274 billion, outlays actually increased $22 billion from the level estimated by the CBO before the deal was cut.                
                

            
                An urgent appeal went out today from TeaParty365, an outfit based in New York. They oppose House Speaker Boehner’s latest proposal to seal a deal, preferring instead the “cut, cap and balance” bill that earlier passed the House. They criticize the latest Boehner plan because it would allow our debt to expand, and relies on a “special committee” to come up with new spending cuts. They remind supporters that there have been “seventeen special committees since 1982 (that) have left us in the hole we’re in today…”                
                

            
                Most Americans are sick to death of Beltway bickering, and would like this debt ceiling crisis solved. Many have been convinced by President Obama that his is the voice of reason – that a “balanced” approach seems fair. However, the president is misleading the American public. His is not a balanced approach; so far, the president has not committed to any specific spending reductions nor any modifications of the long-term entitlements programs that threaten to ruin our country. Serious fiscal reform, which will invariably trim government largess for some, would not be good for his reelection campaign. It is, however, vital to the country’s future.

Obama's Wimp Factor,"Mon, 15 Jun 2009 20:30:47 +0000 –  By Liz Peek
Financial Columnist                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                President Obama is like the starving cheapskate at a smorgasbord; he wants it all, but refuses to pay for it. Health care reform, climate control, smarter schools, ""fairer"" taxes, greener vegetables and fat-free ice cream for everybody -- they're all on the agenda. (Okay, so I snuck in the last two, but no one's really counting.) Our ambitious young leader isn't drawing tight the purse strings; he's refusing to spend the real coin of the political realm - his personal popularity.                
                

            
                ----------                
                

            
                Obama continues to refuse to dip into his treasure chest of popularity but he needs to be prepared to lose some of the ""love"" in the love fest that surrounds him.                
                

            
                ----------                
                

            
                Obama knows, as has every president before him, that he has a window of opportunity. When first elected, each new commander-in-chief has a store of goodwill at his disposal. Some presidents have more, some have less. There's no question that Mr. Obama has a veritable warehouse of public enthusiasm available, but astonishingly, he's as tight as a tick about spending it.                
                

            
                Soon, Obama's window will begin to close, and he knows it. His panicky call to supporters about health care reform from Air Force One the other day said it all. ""If we don't get it done this year, we won't get it done,"" he said. He's right.                
                

            
                Yet, Obama refuses to dip into his treasure chest of popularity. Every time he has to offend some constituency, he shies away. Take the recent, much-ballyhooed tobacco legislation. One of the facets of the bill was that it banned flavors which supposedly make smoking more appealing. The only flavor of any importance - menthol - was, however, left off the list. Why? Because the Congressional Black Caucus lobbied for the omission, knowing that three-quarters of black voters prefer mentholated cigarettes.                
                

            
                This was simple (and unhealthy) pandering to a group that is unlikely to snub President Obama come Election Day. But, Obama couldn't bring himself to spend even a nickel of his popularity passing legislation that might actually reduce smoking.                
                

            
                This thriftiness is even more visible in Obama's plans to overhaul financial regulation. There has been building sentiment that the cut-and-paste approach to financial regulation in this country is disastrously confusing and inefficient. Some attribute the subprime mortgage catastrophe and subsequent recession in part to the ability of financial institutions to shop for the friendliest regulator, and the inability of overseers to see from a top-down perch the excesses building in the system. There has been universal agreement that we need to simplify and streamline the dozens of regulatory authorities that have sprung up as the financial services industry has evolved.                
                

            
                The Obama plan, to be rolled out this week, incredibly adds a layer of regulation by proposing two new structures - a ""council of regulators"" which will apparently be made up of those in charge of the existing agencies - and a new body to oversee consumer products like mortgages and credit cards.                
                

            
                I doubt that anyone in the Obama administration could possibly imagine that this is an improvement over the existing messy status quo. But - surprise! It turns out that the Congressional committees that are charged with regulating the regulators enjoy those powerful positions, and refuse to give them up. Who would Barney Frank be if he couldn't excoriate the titans of Wall Street in his Financial Services Committee? Who would have ever heard of Collin Peterson, except for his oversight of the House Agricultural Committee, which just happens to manage the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission?                
                

            
                Instead of pressing his allies in Congress to accept some diminishment of their responsibilities, Obama caved, perpetuating a dysfunctional regulatory system. Some might welcome this tendency of the president, since it reduces many initiatives to mere gestures. However, the concern for taxpayers is that this proclivity is bound to generate bad legislation. Among Obama's strongest supporters are union members who have already been favored on a number of important fronts. The worrisome disregard for established bankruptcy proceedings in the treatment of Chrysler and GM bondholders, the inclusion of a ""buy America"" provision in the stimulus bill, the threat to cut off aid to California if the state lopped off some union employees, the elimination of a pilot program allowing Mexican trucks to operate in the U.S., the idiotic ""cash for clunkers"" program that will give buyers the opportunity to trade up to a distinctly un-green Hummer - these are just a few examples of union-friendly moves that raise costs and guarantee votes.                
                

            
                Among our greatest challenges is improving the public education system in the U.S. Most would agree that any significant gains will threaten the powerful National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers whose nearly 5 million members ponied up generously for Obama's campaign and worked hard to get out the vote. Arne Duncan, Obama's Education czar, comes with an excellent reputation, and a notable history of championing charter schools that can often skirt union rules. To be successful, Mr. Duncan will have to roll back the insane practice of guaranteeing automatic life-long tenure and extinguish other measures which embrace mediocrity. Unfortunately, one of his first moves was to derail a prized voucher program in Washington, D.C. - not an auspicious start.                
                

            
                I wish Mr. Duncan good luck. To make any real progress, he will have to persuade President Obama to unlock his treasure chest of popularity, and to lose the love-fest. That may be his biggest challenge of all.

"Hey Republicans, Where's the Beef?","My question is this, When are the Republicans going to stop acting like a political party and start acting like American citizens? -- The performance on Saturday in the Senate was one of the worst I have seen since the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky scandal.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The claims made by Republicans in floor speeches were outrageous. They were topped only by Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's final speech right before the cloture vote. He did what family therapists call the ""kitchen sink"" of arguments, throwing out every argument he could to make Americans who were listening very skeptical of the Democrats. His ""kitchen sink"" included the Chinese lecturing us about our debt, statistics that show that one out of ten Americans is looking for a job and that Congress has been on an out-of-control spending binge. --The last time I looked, the balance of trade problem got much worse on George W. Bush's watch and the debt was spiraling down not up on Bill Clinton's watch.                 
                

            
                It is true that President Obama has spent a ton of money and gotten us into further into debt but he was left with no options since our country was teetering on the brink of a depression.                 
                

            
                Sen. McConnell then went on to say that rather then debate the bill that ""we could start over with a step-by-step common sense approach that would fix our problems."" He said that Republicans could encourage healthy choices like prevention programs. But any political observer knows that as soon as that happens the lobbyists are all over Capitol Hill to get any healthy choice legislation out of all bills. This is all laudatory talk but where is Sen. McConnell's bill? Where are his solutions to the uninsured or under insured or the small businesses that can't afford insurance? Why didn't he offer solutions in his speech on the floor?                
                

            
                When asked earlier what he would do if the bill moved to floor debate, he said that there would be a lively amendment process. He is right, now there will be and should be a period marked by a lively amendment process. The Republicans, and some of the doubting Democrats, will have ample time to debate and amend the bill. They can put forth the ""common sense"" approach that Mitch McConnell says is needed, and they can show the rest of us citizens that they are not the party of ""no"" but they have real ideas to help Joe and Sally cope with the high cost of medical care.                 
                

            
                Republicans are complaining about the tax burden and have put forth their own calculations on health care but they do not jive with the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office's scoring of health care reform. The GOP is scaring people with promises of higher taxes but there is no evidence that there are going to be huge tax increase on most citizens except the very wealthy.                
                

            
                There are many things to be questioned about the health care bill such as the shortage of medical residency training slots, the shortage of nurses and the influence of the guilds such as the American Medical Association. There are some real questions to be answered like why (according to the Congressional Budget Office) are only 96% of Americans covered under current proposals? There are legitimate questions about the funding of Medicare and any cuts to services. Those are the kinds of amendments and questions that should come up in the debate process of this bill. The Republicans in the Senate have had months to write their own bill and propose viable solutions. So far all they have done is to say that this bill should not be debated on the floor. It is high time the Senate Republicans encouraged debate and offered alternative solutions. If they did that then they would be doing what the voters sent them to Washington to do.

7 Sickening Questions About Obamacare,"A new CBS News poll finds that “nearly two in three Americans want Republicans in Congress to continue to challenge parts of the health care reform bill.” At this point, there will only be minor technical changes in the bill even with the new House vote required for final passage. But the battle over public opinion goes on. Here are seven sickening questions about Obamacare that all Americans must consider:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                1. What big government entitlement program has ever:                
                

            
                • Reduced the deficit?
• Only cost what it says it will and lowered the costs of goods and services?
• Improved quality?
• Enhanced efficiency?
• Decreased delays?
• Fostered more choice and competition?
• Featured competent bureaucracy?
• Operated with honest accounting?
• Avoided fraud, abuse, waste, maddening red tape, and higher taxes?                
                

            
                Why should we trust that Obamacare will do all that? Obamacare’s deceptive budget cooking was described in one instance by Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad (D-ND) as ""a Ponzi scheme of the first order, the kind of thing that Bernie Madoff would have been proud of.""                
                

            
                2. Why does Obamacare exempt some in Congress and the White House from having to buy the same health care plans that the law forces other Americans to purchase: President Obama, Vice President Biden, Cabinet members, top White House staff, congressional committee staff and leadership staff, such as those who work for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)?                 
                

            
                Republican Senators Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Tom Coburn (Oklahoma) tried to close this loophole, but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) wouldn’t even let it come up for a vote. As Grassley says, “It’s only fair and logical that top administration officials, who fought so hard for passage of this overhaul of America’s health care system, experience it themselves. If it’s as good as promised, they’ll know it first-hand. If there are problems, they’ll be able to really understand them, as they should.”

3. How will we deal with a doctor shortage caused by Obamacare, particularly when doctors are being asked to treat 32 million more Americans now insured by the new law?                 
                

            
                The Medicus Firm a medical recruitment company, found in a survey that 46 percent of physicians said they’d quit or retire if Obamacare became law. According to the survey, ""even if a much smaller percentage such as ten, 15, or 20 percent are pushed out of practice over several years at a time when the field needs to expand by over 20 percent, this would be severely detrimental to the quality of the health care system.""                
                

            
                4. How will patients—particularly senior citizens—feel when their doctors and even hospitals tell them, “Sorry, but we’re only taking on non-Medicare patients who pay privately, in full”?                 
                

            
                The New York Times (which championed Obamacare) wrote last year that “Some doctors—often internists but also gastroenterologists, gynecologists, psychiatrists and other specialists—are no longer accepting Medicare, either because they have opted out of the insurance system or they are not accepting new patients with Medicare coverage. The doctors’ reasons: reimbursement rates are too low and paperwork too much of a hassle.” Under ObamaCare, physicians’ Medicare fees are supposed to be cut 21 percent and hospital reimbursements for Medicare patients chopped by $1.3-billion. How long can doctors and hospitals sustain those losses before they’re forced to pull the plug on treating Medicare patients (although some exceptions may be made in dire emergencies)? Count on Congress to use budget tricks like temporary “fixes” to defer those cuts until at least after the November elections.                
                

            
                5. How can President Obama claim that insurance premiums will go down when the very same nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office he quotes, selectively, has said that Obamacare will cause the average family’s premiums to go up by as much as 13 percent by 2016?                
                

            
                6. Remember the “jobs saved or created” canard regarding Obama’s economic stimulus?                 
                

            
                The president is repeating that fantasy by applying it to Obamacare. However, the nonpartisan Lewin Group estimates that as many as 600,000 people will lose their jobs due to the onerous new employer health care mandates in Obamacare.

7. Do you realize that Obamacare turns Medicare into what should really be called ""Medi-pare""?                 
                

            
                Obamacare slices $528-billion from Medicare, including $136-billion carved out of Medicare Advantage. As The Washington Examiner’s Susan Ferrechio has reported, “The Medicare Advantage cuts will force 4.8 million seniors off the popular plan by 2019. An additional $23 billion in cuts to Medicare will come from a panel charged with slashing Medicare spending.”                
                

            
                Those are just some of the gut-wrenching questions about Obamacare that cry out for answers. But as the expression goes, “It’s what you don’t know that really hurts you.” Obamacare is so full of dubious assumptions that in future years we may rename it Obama’s box, as in Pandora’s box.

Why Health Care Is Killing Obama,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Barack Obama is disconnected from the American people on the ideas behind improving health care in America. Recent Gallup poll numbers -- placing him below former President Jimmy Carter in overall approval ratings -- point to it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                And now so do numbers of additional new polls.                
                

            
                The Washington Post/ABC News poll, which openly admits to polling a heavier segment of registered Democrats than independents and Republicans, puts his approval rating at below 50%.
The ""passion index"" tracked by the Rasmussen poll has watched the president's ""strongly approve"" numbers go from ""+10"" on May 31, to break even ""+0"" on June 28, to ""-8"" on July14th. Those numbers mean that 8% more of the population now ""strongly disapprove"" of his performance/policies, than ""strongly approve."" Among male voters the Rasmussen index is a ""-10"" point spread.                
                

            
                And a recent Public Strategies poll reports that only 44% of the American people feel the administration is on the right course. That's interesting because in March that number was 54%. Even big business has a better trend than the president: Four perecent of the population trust ""corporate America"" to do the ""right thing"" more than they did two months ago.                
                

            
                Earlier this week his head to head re-election numbers against the third place GOP contender in 2008, Mitt Romney, were dead even at 45% each.                
                

            
                So what happened since May to tank Obama?                
                

            
                In three words: health care reform.                
                

            
                The American people have seen what's in the plan. (Something the president admitted to not seeing last ) And they don't like it.                
                

            
                In many of the polls the voters themselves are not buying the rhetoric they are being sold. Statements like ""if you like your current health care plan, you can keep it"" or ""you will pay less"" or that ""quality will improve"" are now being exposed as less than truthful. The New York Post reported last Monday that even White House spokespersons have said that those statements aren't meant to be taken literally.                
                

            
                Press Secretary Robert Gibbs has even indicated that the president is already willing to break his biggest campaign promise of all in order to pay for it. (You remember that one, where ""no one making under $250,000 per year would see their taxes go up by a single dime."") Such a moment, a genuine ""read my lips, no new taxes"" kind of moment, is difficult for millions of tax-payers to accept. This is particularly true because such a tax increase will target small business owners first. And it also doesn't help much that small businesses are the ones who create 2 out of every 3 new jobs today.                
                

            
                Poll findings on the issue of the universal health care coverage itself is perhaps most important indicator. According to the Public Strategies poll 44% of us believe the overall cost of health care will go up under the Obama plan, and only 27% believe costs will decrease. Sixty-three percent in that same poll now believe they will see huge tax spikes in order to pay for it, only 9% say taxes will go down.                
                

            
                And just to the issue of effectiveness, 42% believe that health care will get worse, only 33% believe it will improve even marginally. Forty percent believe access to actual care will become more difficult, 38% said they believe access would improve.                
                

            
                The fact that some Congressional Democrats are blocking the version of the bill from even being written for committee consideration speaks volumes.                
                

            
                So does the aggregate picture of what all this adds up to. In essence people began the year thinking that the president's message was going to be something that would improve their lives. Unfortunately for all who thought as much, more have lost their jobs, unemployment is still growing at 10% with new numbers expected this week. And the prospect of possibly spending trillions more, just to have the privilege of making government bigger, even less efficient, and forcing politicians to take their eye off the real issue--jobs--is just too much for the average American family to withstand at this point.                
                

            
                The proof is in the polling.                
                

            
                The president may want to nationalize the health care industry, and he may yet ramp up another week of Rose Garden speeches to re-wrap the details in the warm fuzzy of his articulation skills, but overall, Americans are voting ""no.""                
                

            
                They're also asking Mr. Obama to go stand in line behind President Carter, and heaven knows how frustrating that must be.

"Opinion: Obamacare should be a hand up, not a handout to those in need","In 2012, Nancy Pelosi ominously declared that Congress needed to pass the health care reform bill so the public could find out what was in it. Unfortunately, ever since that fateful day, Americans have been plagued with one bad health care surprise after another.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Millions of people have lost their coverage since the passage of the “Affordable” Care Act (despite President Obama’s promise to the contrary). In addition, it has recently become known that health care premiums are poised for a sharp rise in 2016—again, despite the promises that the President and Democrats made when Obamacare was signed into law. And let’s not forget that a Supreme Court decision in the pending King v. Burwell case might result in the dismantling of federally-run Obamacare exchanges.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            It should be obvious that attacking an effective, revenue-neutral program that helps patients in need receive vital medications is just not the best way to address the many issues facing American families when it comes to health care.
					
		   				- Mario H. Lopez
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                It is clear that no matter the outcome of the Supreme Court case, Obamacare – as it was conceived – is unlikely to weather ongoing scrutiny. With that in mind, it’s time for a fact-based examination of the health care policies that work (versus those that have utterly failed).                
                

            
                It is strange, then, that out of all the challenges faced by the system, some Republican Members of Congress are turning their attention to a decades-old, cost-neutral health care program that directly benefits patients in need. The 340B drug-pricing program should be a shining example of the way the safety net is supposed to work, yet it is now coming under fire.                
                

            
                The program has been around for over 20 years; President George H.W. Bush signed it into law in 1992 in order to “stretch scarce federal resources” by easing costs for providers who are designated as “critical access.”  Currently, pharmaceutical companies that participate in Medicaid must sell medication to critical access hospitals at a discount. In return for their voluntary participation, companies gain access to millions of customers – and although those customers pay a discounted rate, companies still receive significant payments for their products. In 2012, sales of medications under the 340B program totaled $6.9 billion.

                At a time when hospitals (especially those in rural and inner-city areas serving working class patients) are closing their doors at an alarming rate, Republicans should be working to double down on effective health care policies. Savings under the 340B program enable critical access hospitals to serve low-income and underserved patients in need of vital medicines. These “safety net” hospitals are the first line of defense for communities struggling to provide basic health care to their citizens.                
                

            
                At the end of the day, the 340B program allows patients who might otherwise not be able to receive necessary medication to purchase those medications through critical access hospitals – and struggling hospitals that serve at-risk patients are able to keep their lights on and their books balanced. And for those who are concerned with the high cost of health care in America, it is worth stressing that the 340B program is one of the (very few) public health policies that does not cost taxpayers a dime.                 
                

            
                New limits on hospital eligibility to participate in the program will restrict patient access and directly harm at-risk patients. And all taxpayers stand to take a hit, as increased Medicare costs that would result from scaling back the 340B program would of course fall on their shoulders.                
                

            
                In addition, more critical access hospitals themselves would face financial burdens that magnify the pressures that have forced many to close their doors. With each hospital closure comes a new community crisis, and the lost jobs and patient access problems that naturally follow. The numbers are staggering: 16 rural hospitals closed in 2014 alone, while from 1970-2010, more than 300 urban hospitals closed in inner cities around the country.                
                

            
                Many of these hospital closures have occurred in areas with significant Hispanic, African American and other minority populations—constituencies with which the GOP should be working to improve, rather than degrade, its standing.                
                

            
                It should be obvious that attacking an effective, revenue-neutral program that helps patients in need receive vital medications is just not the best way to address the many issues facing American families when it comes to health care.                
                

            
                Now more than ever, the American people need effective leadership to help fix our broken healthcare system and the many problems that Obamacare has exacerbated. Republicans should be focused on solving the problems Obamacare created or worsened and ensuring that the safety net serves its intended purpose: as a hand up, not a handout, for those who need it most.

THE FIRST 100 DAYS: Obama Deserves a Failing Grade,"Wed, 29 Apr 2009 18:30:02 +0000 –  By Jon KrausharCommunications Consultant                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs has given the Obama administration a ""B-plus"" for its first 100 days and has graded the news media a ""strong A;"" but both should be flunked for failing to admit that Barack Obama is rationing where he shouldn't and not rationing where he should.                
                

            
                Obama's sweeping health care reform proposals are ridden with rationing when you look behind the code language and stealth tactics. Just recently, on ""Meet the Press,"" Lawrence Summers, Obama's chief economic adviser, talked about ""experts"" who, using ""the right kind of cost effectiveness...estimate that we could take as much as $700 billion a year out of our health care system"" by eliminating unnecessary procedures.                
                

            
                
 Obama celebrates his first 100 days in office with nary a nod to what he is rationing and what he is failing to ration.
                
                

            
                Under Obamacare, those ""experts"" will be government bureaucrats -- not doctors. Obama's stimulus package dedicates $1.1 billion to medical ""comparative effectiveness research."" This is Obama-speak for bureaucrats determining if your doctor is using what the government deems are the right procedures at appropriate costs. Other than Gibbs and the see-hear-and-speak-no-rationing mainstream media reporters, who doesn't acknowledge that health care rationing is baked into Obama's health care plans?                
                

            
                Rationing is also an important part of other of Obama's priorities. Although President Obama pays lip service to educational reform, including the expansion of charter schools, Obama opted for rationing when his Education Department ended the Opportunity Scholarship Program that had provided 1,714 mostly black and Hispanic children in the District of Columbia with $7,500 per child in vouchers to move them from failing D.C. schools into private or parochial schools (where their reading scores beat their public school counterparts). Don't count on Gibbs and Obama's journalistic cheerleaders to tell you that Obama will cave and allow similar forms of rationing to please the teachers' unions and that 38 percent of members of Congress have theirchildren in private schools.                
                

            
                Rationing oil exploration, the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy (in favor of expensive ""alternatives"" such as ethanol) as well as the rationing of carbon emissions in a ""cap-and-trade"" program are all elements of Obama's ""green"" agenda. Of course the government, which has ""bailed out"" automakers, is also pressuring them to ""ration"" the production of cars that don't meet Obama's ""green"" standards. The net effect will be to ration consumer choices and also to impose the largest tax increase (on energy) in American history.                
                

            
                Regarding national defense, Obama's most ambitious rationing proposal is his call for a worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons. So far, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Al Qaeda and others threatening the United States have shown no inclination to follow Obama's lead. Will Obama ""ration"" military spending and efforts against terrorism to the point that the country will be judiciously protected? His first 100 days have raised several questions in that regard.                
                

            
                The one area where Obama has failed to ration is in his massive expansion of government spending, taxation, indebtedness and control. Obama has ignored several opportunities to cut pork projects and other government waste, abuse and corruption.                
                

            
                As President Obama celebrates his first 100 days in office with nary a nod to what he is rationing and what he is failing to ration, consider that he still has 1360 days in office to make either the right or the wrong decisions about rationing.                
                

            
                Since we can't rely on his press secretary or many in the mainstream media to reveal what's really happening, it's important that wedon't ration our vigilance or our outspokenness.

ObamaCare 2015: Harvard faculty outraged over health care hikes,"Now Playing                            Harvard faculty outraged over higher health-care costs                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    









    
        
    

    

    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Turns out there’s no free lunch, even if you’re among those lucky few dining at the Harvard Faculty Club.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The New York Times is feasting on the delicious uproar created by Harvard professors who are now outraged to be hit with higher health care costs as a result of ObamaCare. I hardly know where to start on this one. Perhaps with the fact that the article appears in the New York Times? I will let that one go for the moment.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            We all want life to be better for everyone. Who wouldn’t want all of their fellow Americans, or all of humanity for that matter, to have good health care? But are you willing to personally take a pay cut to pay for the policy you are advocating?
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                Here’s what’s clear: Health care costs at Harvard are going up. Immediately. And they are rising directly as a result of ObamaCare.                 
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            We all want life to be better for everyone. Who wouldn’t want all of their fellow Americans, or all of humanity for that matter, to have good health care? But are you willing to personally take a pay cut to pay for the policy you are advocating?
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                The explanation written right at the top of Harvard’s health care enrollment guide for 2015 states that the university “must respond to the national trend of rising health care costs, including some driven by health care reform.” The guide even highlights, in a special little box in the margin, the exact “Impact of Health Care Reform,” explaining that “The Affordable Care Act has brought new benefits and opportunities to many people but with added costs to sponsors.”                
                

            
                Say what?? Who could have predicted that? Anyone who can do math.                 
                

            
                Still, the special little box goes on to point to such benefits as keeping offspring on your plan until they are 26 and the Cadillac tax as added costs. And as a result, they say premiums and deductibles are rising.                 
                

            
                One French history professor gasps without a hint of irony that rising premiums are tantamount to a pay cut! Welcome to our world.                
                

            
                Still the rising costs aren’t necessarily news to everyone. Several years back, Harvard’s own provost, Dr. Alan M. Garber, sent an open letter to President Obama praising the Cadillac tax as a way to rein in health care costs and premiums. In subsequent interviews, he’s defended his stance and the higher costs he and co-workers are now facing.                
                

            
                I’m betting he’s having a hard time finding a tablemate at the Harvard Faculty Club this week.                
                

            
                Provost Garber should not be confused with another economist with a similar sounding name working about a mile down the Charles River at MIT, Jonathan Gruber.                 
                

            
                Gruber infamously counted on the “stupidity of the American voter” to overlook the obvious math that’s now confronting Harvard’s staff. Harvard faculty may be a lot of things, but stupid ain’t one of them.                 
                

            
                In fact, Meredith Rosenthal, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, told the Times she was “puzzled by the outcry. The changes in Harvard faculty benefits are parallel to changes all Americans are seeing. Indeed they have come to our front door much later than others.”                
                

            
                No, I don’t think these folks are surprised by the math. I am a graduate of the Harvard Economics Department, and I have sat in these classrooms. I would bet the faculty just didn’t believe they would have to foot the bill. Costs may rise, but they would somehow be absorbed in the system. Donors, someone … someone else, that is … would pay.                
                

            
                And that is, in fact, one of the main problems in American politics. We all want life to be better for everyone. Who wouldn’t want all of their fellow Americans, or all of humanity for that matter, to have good health care? But are you willing to personally take a pay cut to pay for the policy you are advocating?                
                

            
                That’s the hard question the president and proponents of ObamaCare did not want you to grapple with, because they were afraid your reaction would be akin to the screams now echoing through Harvard Yard.

When Obama Met Martin Luther King In the Oval Office,"This Sunday President Obama will celebrate the opening of the new Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in Washington, D.C. with a speech to be televised nationally.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is a moment rich in history – the first black president dedicating the first national monument to the power of a black minister born at time of racial segregation and who never held high office, led no army to victory and had no wealth.                
                

            
                Dr. King is honored for the power of his words, his Christian appeals for equality in the name of America’s enduring, inspiring capacity to right the wrongs of the past in the name of justice for all.

                President Obama had a dream yesterday.                
                

            
                He saw Dr. King was in the Oval Office. The president was finalizing his speech to celebrate the opening of the King memorial on the National Mall. He looked up from his desk to see a balding old black man, mumbling words from King’s August 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech.                
                

            
                “I still have a dream,” the old man said. The president looked around to see where this man with the familiar voice had come from. Then it hit him and he said “Is that you, Dr. King?”                
                

            
                The nation’s first black President, a very logical, learned and pragmatic man, knew he was dreaming.                
                

            
                But even in the dream he rubbed his eyes in disbelief at the 82-year-old man who looked like a living Dr. King. This Dr. King began speaking louder and louder, reciting words he first spoke at the March on Washington. In lyrical tones he again spoke of his dream of America as a nation rising up to fulfill the Founding Father’s creed of all God’s children being equal... “a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.”                
                

            
                OBAMA: Dr. King? Is that you?                
                

            
                MLK: Mr. President.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Big day for you. Your memorial is between Jefferson and Lincoln.                
                

            
                MLK: And a big day for you, too.                
                

            
                OBAMA: I know. I am trying to get this speech right. It is hard to compete with your words, your dreams for America.                
                

            
                MLK: You are living a dream, my dream, America’s dream, Mr. President. So many of us dreamed of a nation that judges its children and its leaders not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character. You could not have won without white support. You know, son, my spirit was there three years ago today in Denver when you became the first African American to accept the presidential nomination of a major political party. I was never prouder.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Thank you.                
                

            
                MLK: What happened?                
                

            
                OBAMA: What do you mean?                
                

            
                MLK: You spoke about change and hope. Yet, three years in - little has changed and it seems people are losing hope. The American people like you, they love your family, but they are losing the dream.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Change takes time. I am doing the best I can with a bad situation.                
                

            
                MLK: What happened to the “fierce urgency of now?”                
                

            
                Even in his dream President Obama recognized the line from the famous speech. And he did not like it being thrown in his face.
King had said to the 200,000 black, white and Hispanic people there, then largest civil rights march in history at a time of mass jailing and murders of activists involved in intense struggles against racism in small towns and big cities, that there was “no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism …now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice… it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment.”                
                

            
                OBAMA: I don’t need you to lecture me, old man. I know the ‘urgency of now.’ We prevented a second Great Depression and passed health care reform.                
                

            
                MLK: True, that was a good start. But why do you think your political opponents won control of the House while your base of support is sinking and even your support in the liberal community is now colored by disappointment? You extended the Bush tax cuts. You gave up on the public option in the health care bill leaving millions of people uninsured with insurance companies still in control.                
                

            
                OBAMA: I’m a politician. You never ran for any office. You gave great speeches but I am President for everyone. Remember that!                
                

            
                An upset President was standing now, waving his hand and pointing over his desk at the original dreamer, Dr. King.                
                

            
                OBAMA: If I keep my cool and reach out in the spirit of bipartisanship the American people will see who is fighting for them. We have an election coming – the people will decide.                
                

            
                MLK: Really? What about Senator Tom Coburn, whom you once called “not only a dear friend, but also a brother in Christ?” He recently said your “intent is to create dependency” because “as an African-American male, you received tremendous advantage from a lot of these (government) programs.” If that is how your friend talks about you, what must your enemies say?                
                

            
                OBAMA: Tom didn’t really mean that – he must just be trying to fend off a primary challenge from the Tea Party.                
                

            
                MLK: I was up against that violent Birmingham police commissioner Bull Connor with his fire hoses and police dogs. You are up against the non violent opposition of the Tea Party and talk radio. Even most Republicans think the rich should pay more taxes and you still can’t make it happen. We had actual bruises in our struggle you have only a bruised ego.                
                

            
                OBAMA: I will be able to do more in the second term.                
                

            
                MLK: If you get a second term. Lyndon Johnson passed Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, The Economic Opportunity Act – all in his first four years in office. Those were much tougher sells than ending tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. He did not wait for a second term.                
                

            
                OBAMA: At least we can agree that my presidency has lifted up the black community?                
                

            
                The president shifted from pointing at the living Dr. King to turning his hands up, as if pleading for understanding. He walked over to Dr. King who seemed to be fading, disappearing into the dream.                
                

            
                MLK: The poverty rate is over 15 percent, about 25 percent for blacks and Hispanics. Almost 17% of black people are unemployed. One in nine black men between the ages of 20 and 36 are in prison. Public education in poor neighborhoods is still in shambles. Yes, a black man as President of the United States is a symbol of hope but you need to live up to that symbol with policies that help all the people, especially the children and the poor.                
                

            
                A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Please, Dr. King.                
                

            
                Just then the image of Dr. King faded to a ghost in the Oval Office. But his voice could still be heard. As the President looked around the room, King spoke about America’s heritage of social protest, it capacity for non-violent change, and the enduring promise chiseled in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence of “Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness,” for all Americans. He spoke about a nation that had sent him to jail for protesting segregation now honoring him with a monument to be opened with words from a black president.                
                

            
                MLK: God bless, America, Mr. President. You are going to have to stand up and let your friends and foes know you, not the politician but the child of Republican Abe Lincoln and Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, a fighter for all the people.                
                

            
                By now the president was turning around and around looking for the living Dr. King. He found himself waking from the dream, tangled in the covers he had pulled off of Michelle. She asked him if he was okay.                
                

            
                The president looked at his wife and said: You know he is more than a monument. Dr.King is alive.

"Romney, Gingrich, Huntsman and Health Care Hypocrisy","What do Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, have in common?
Long before President Obama even entered the Oval Office, both men supported an idea they now pretend to spurn — the idea of requiring people to buy health insurance.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As recently as 2009, Romney publicly supported, the “individual mandate” for buying health insurance. And as recently as last month one of Gingrich’s websites still endorsed the “mandate” for all Americans earning more than $50,000 annually.                
                

            
                Romney and Gingrich are not alone in their history of supporting the idea of a government requirement that everyone buy health insurance. As governor of Utah in 2007, Jon Huntsman endorsed a health care reform plan from the United Way of Salt Lake City that called for a mandate.                
                

            
                “I think if you’re going to get it done and get it done right, the mandate has to be part of it in some way, shape or form,” he said at the time.                
                

            
                Gingrich, Romney and Huntsman are wide open to charges of political hypocrisy.                
                

            
                They apparently feel the need to fake their outrage over the individual mandate to win the GOP nomination. In an age of outrageous political posturing — telling lies and daring anyone to call you on it — this is the strongest indicator of the current lack of leadership and honest political debate about major national problems.                
                

            
                And it is not even good politics.                
                

            
                A CNN poll taken in November found that support for the individual mandate rose to its highest level yet, with 52 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed. The previous poll taken in June found that 54 percent opposed it and 44 percent supported it. That shift to support for the individual mandate is likely to grow as more parts of the overall Affordable Healthcare Act go into effect over the next two years.                
                

            
                At the moment, polling results on the overall national health care reform plan range from support between 38 percent and 40 percent and opposition between 44 percent and 48 percent (Quinnipiac and Kaiser Family polling). That split is pretty good for a plan filled with so many unknowns.                
                

            
                But as the GOP contenders face waves of strong conservative voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, united principally by a distaste for Obama, those candidates have concluded it is wise to pretend to have no connection with Obama’s signature legislation. Tea Party anger at the Democrats’ health care reform plan did drive the success of Republican candidates who won big in the 2010 midterm elections.                
                

            
                But times change.                
                

            
                Now national polls show support for the Tea Party is lower than support for Occupy Wall Street, and falling fast. And already Americans express support for key elements of the health care reform legislation that have been implemented, including allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans until they are twenty six.                
                

            
                Similarly, support is high for requiring insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing medical conditions as well as closing the so-called “doughnut hole” in subsidies that help seniors pay for prescription drugs.                
                

            
                The general election campaign is going to be even more distant from angry Tea Party activists. By the 2012 general election, the eventual GOP nominee is going to be open to charges of flip-flopping on healthcare reform. He will also find himself out of step with the American people who know the status quo on healthcare is expensive and leaves them vulnerable to the profit-driven prerogatives of insurance companies.                
                

            
                Romney, Gingrich and Huntsman have to realize they are playing a losing game in terms of general election politics.                
                

            
                At the CNN debate this October in Las Vegas, Gingrich took a swipe at Romney over the former Massachusetts governor’s healthcare plan that requires citizens in the Bay State to buy health insurance. Romney shot back: “Newt, we got the idea of individual mandate from you.”                
                

            
                Gingrich responded: “You did not get that from me. You got that from the Heritage Foundation.”                
                

            
                They are both correct on this revealing point. The Heritage Foundation, the influential conservative think tank, first developed the idea of an individual mandate for healthcare in the late 1980s. That is how deeply this idea is tied to conservative thinkers.                
                

            
                Romney used the Heritage policy in developing his Massachusetts health care law. That reform contained the dreaded individual mandate.                
                

            
                And Gingrich supported the federal mandate as an alternative to Hillary Clinton’s health care reform package when he was Speaker in the 1990s.                
                

            
                If Republican voters heard Gingrich and Romney speak honestly about health care reform — and why they came to appreciate and support the good of the individual mandate — my bet is that most GOP and independent voters would be more impressed than they are with the blatant lies now being told on the campaign trail.

KARL ROVE: Senate Democrats Are Foolish If They Think That ObamaCare Repeal Can't Happen,"Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin likes to taunt his Republican colleagues, arguing that ObamaCare can't be repealed because 60 votes are required to end debate in the Senate on any measure.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Though Republicans will likely win control of the Senate in 2012, Mr. Durbin is right that they probably won't get to 60 senators. That would require the GOP to win back more than half the Democratic seats up next year. Rep. Jim Moran (D., Va.) recently called GOP promises of repeal ""a political scam on their base. . . . It can't happen.""                
                

            
                Not so fast. Keith Hennessey, a former White House colleague of mine, says Democrats are wrong. He argues that Republicans can repeal health-care reform with a simple Senate majority.                
                

            
                Director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, Mr. Hennessey now teaches at Stanford Business School and is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. Last week on his website, KeithHennessey.com, he made the case that congressional Republicans could use the reconciliation process to kill ObamaCare with 51 votes in the Senate and a majority in the House of Representatives.                
                

            
                The Budget Act of 1974 established the reconciliation process. The House and Senate Budget Committees can direct other committees to make changes in mandatory spending (like ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion and insurance subsidies) and the tax code (such as ObamaCare's levies on insurance policies, hospitals and drug companies) to make spending and revenue conform with the goals set by the annual budget resolution.

Opinion: Not voting in November could mean a 'wall' between you and your healthcare,"BERLIN, GERMANY - SEPTEMBER 05:  A doctor uses a stethoscope on a patient on September 5, 2012 in Berlin, Germany. Doctors in the country are demanding higher payments from health insurance companies (Krankenkassen). Over 20 doctors' associations are expected to hold a vote this week over possible strikes and temporary closings of their practices if assurances that a requested additional annual increase of 3.5 billion euros (4,390,475,550 USD) in payments are not provided. The Kassenaerztlichen Bundesvereinigung (KBV), the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, unexpectedly broke off talks with the health insurance companies on Monday.

                Over the past few weeks, tens of millions of Americans tuned in to the political conventions. And not surprisingly, Obamacare was a central issue during both conventions. One party chanting for its repeal, the other touting its successes.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                During his address, Donald Trump chalked up the need to repeal and replace Obamacare to the fact that you will be able to “choose your own doctor again.” This was in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton’s mention of Obamacare which she says has insured 20 million people since its adoption.                
                

            
                So, why does the GOP have such a doom and gloom view of Obamacare? And why have they spent the past six years challenging the most comprehensive and inclusive health legislation ever passed by Congress? For starters, they might not want you to know that it’s working – particularly for the Latino community. And, that you actually CAN choose your own doctor, among other benefits.                
                

            
                In the six years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed, we have made great strides to address health disparities in the Latino community. Before health care reform, 32 percent of Latinos were uninsured – the highest uninsurance rate of any racial or ethnic group in the United States. That lack of insurance was particularly troubling as Latinos tend to suffer from many illnesses and chronic health conditions at much higher rates than white Americans.                
                

            
                Since its enactment, the ACA has resulted in more than 4 million Latino adults gaining insurance coverage. Nearly 9 million Latinos with private insurance can now access free preventative healthcare, including flu shots, mammograms, depression and cervical cancer screenings. They can no longer be dropped by their insurer just because they get sick. Major federal investments and ongoing reforms to our health care system will soon improve the quality of care and management of chronic diseases. So it’s clear that Latinos stand to lose the most during a Donald Trump presidency.

                Regardless of the progress we have made in increasing health equity, Obamacare has faced (and survived) two Supreme Court challenges and more than 60 repeal votes. Just a few months ago, Congressional Republicans came closer to repeal than ever before by using a fast-track legislative tool that sent a repeal bill to President Obama’s desk with only a simple majority in the Senate (it was of course vetoed).                
                

            
                While Obamacare seems invincible, it’s important that voters and supporters of the law not become complacent. Make no mistake, this election marks a critical juncture for Obamacare and our country. One that presents both opportunities and challenges for health reform, and will determine whether we want a more equitable, accessible, and patient-centered health system, or whether we reverse course toward a system of increasing health disparities.                
                

            
                Still, there is much more work to be done to ensure that the Latino community receives the high quality and equitable health care they deserve. While blacks and whites have seen their uninsured rates decrease by 50 percent as a result of Obamacare, Latinos have only seen theirs fall by 25 percent. According to the Urban Institute, 1 in 5 Latino adults are still uninsured and most are unaware of financial assistance available through the ACA. This means we have more to do to make sure Latinos fully realize all of the benefits accruing from the ACA. Health providers, promotoras de salud, navigators and other community leaders must do a better job connecting with Latino communities to educate them about the health insurance marketplace and the many low cost coverage options available.                
                

            
                So, where should the Latino community go from here? First, go to healthcare.gov to explore options if you haven’t already. Open enrollment for getting into the ACA health insurance exchange is fast approaching and you might not want to miss out.                
                

            
                From there, go to the polls this November. It’s not only important that you cast your vote to ensure the right presidential candidate makes it to the White House, but that you are making your voice heard when it comes to electing local and state legislators. They are often the ones making decisions on state healthcare matters, so make them aware of the issues and how you want them to act on your behalf.                
                

            
                Because not voting could mean waking up on November 9 to find a “wall” built between you and the healthcare coverage that is your right and privilege.

Terminating American gridlock,"The pressing issues of excess debt, high unemployment and anemic economic growth have generated pessimism throughout the Western World, dividing both our governmental leaders and the public at large into warring political camps.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Right- and left-wing ideologues – in America are talking past each other in a continual “Dialogue of the Deaf.” They have insulted our intelligence and created stifling policy gridlock in Washington.                
                

            
                Fortunately, all is not yet lost. In my new book, ""American Gridlock – Why the Left and Right are Both Wrong,"" I demonstrate how we can end this pointless dialogue and, at the same time, escape the current gridlock via new policies that work.                
                

            
                Specifically, I identify five key challenges the nation now faces and derive win-win strategies for meeting each — strategies that transcend the traditional left/right divide and render it irrelevant. These challenges are:                
                

            
                1) Avoiding a “lost decade” marked by permanently high unemployment;
2) Averting eventual national bankruptcy due to exploding health-care costs.
3) Preventing future “perfect financial storms” like the one that triggered the global depression in 2008.
4) Standing up to “thugocracies” that use currency manipulation and unfair trade policies to take advantage of us.
5) Confronting the increasingly heated debate over “fair shares” of wealth and income – or “Distributive Justice,” as the philosophers call it.                
                

            
                Without doubt, these are difficult issues – but it is possible to derive solutions to each, solutions that transcend stale left/right ideologies.                 
                

            
                The key is to apply deductive logic in identifying wholly new policy solutions – solutions based on new and unfamiliar types of logic such as game theory and the economics of uncertainty.                 
                

            
                This method stands in stark contrast to today’s more common approach, based on bastardized inductive logic in which data are cherry-picked to support pre-existing policy prejudices.

As an example, my analysis deduced that there is only one strategy that will prevent this decade from becoming a “lost” one defined by stagnation and high unemployment. This is to adopt a new Marshall Plan, investing in a variety of large-scale infrastructure projects – not mere “pothole filling” as is currently the fashion.                 
                

            
                The catch is that these projects must be fiscally worthwhile, being funded only if independent experts certify they will earn a positive return on capital invested.                
                

            
                This stipulation guarantees that these projects will more than return the funds borrowed to finance them. Any short-term deficits they give rise to are thus “good deficits.”                 
                

            
                Today’s heated debates over deficits consistently ignore this distinction between good and bad deficits. The former result from borrowing for productive investments that will pay for themselves rather than burdening our children with future debt. Bad deficits of the kind we have accumulated in recent years do not pay for themselves.                
                

            
                Another policy challenge lies in constraining mushrooming health care expenditures. Medical costs currently account for 18.3% of GDP and are projected to soar to 35% or more by mid-century.                 
                

            
                Happily, this crisis can also be averted by adopting a single over-arching policy that satisfies the following three goals of health care reform:                
                

            
                1) Greatly expanded access to health care (in accord with ObamaCare);
2) Major increases in the supply of health care services (not in accord with supply-lite ObamaCare). 
3) A significant and ongoing reduction in total health-care expenditure as a share of GDP over time (a goal never previously proposed as it would seem too much to hope for given the first two goals).                
                

            
                The policy required to satisfy all three goals is to shift outward the supply curve for health care services faster than the demand curve shifts outward – a process I detail in my book, proving its validity. In short, I show exactly how we can have our cake and eat it too on this all-important issue.                
                

            
                With respect to preventing future “perfect financial storms” from ravaging global economies, as happened during 2007-2009, there’s only one “control variable” that can be successfully manipulated: the degree of leverage permitted in the financial system.                 
                

            
                Drawing on a powerful new theory of market risk assessment developed at Stanford University, I demonstrate that the damage wreaked by “perfect storms” increases exponentially with greater leverage. Leverage must thus be cut much more than is proposed in current reform proposals.                
                

            
                The fourth challenge lies in more successfully confronting nations, such as China, that repeatedly take advantage of us in negotiations, especially over trade.                 
                

            
                This is a many-faceted issue, but one I believe can be resolved in favor of the U.S. through the use of important new bargaining techniques derived from the theories of John F. Nash Jr., whose story was told in the film ""A Beautiful Mind.""                
                

            
                The fifth challenge is to confront two issues raised by the “Occupy” movements that have sprouted across the globe:                
                

            
                1) The true status of “capitalism,” a creed increasingly under attack. What passes for capitalism today is far different from what Adam Smith and early academic economists meant by the term.                 
                

            
                In the book, I clarify these differences, showing how true capitalism can generate faster economic growth and higher living standards than any other possible system. Thus in reining in abuses in real-world capitalism, we must not throw the baby out with the bath water.                
                

            
                2) The concept of a “fair” distribution of wealth – a major dividing point between the left and the right. There are two fundamental norms of fair distribution – “To Each According to His Contribution,” and “To Each According to His Need” – with the capitalist right claiming contribution has primacy and the left traditionally arguing neediness has priority.                 
                

            
                At the end of the book, I sketch out a plan for achieving a new theory of justice that incorporates – and, indeed, integrates – the two concepts of relative need and relative contribution.                
                

            
                Only by applying rigorous deductive logic to these five different policy arenas can we transcend today’s Left/Right divide – and, in so doing, offer hope that American gridlock can indeed be broken.

Obama's Slick,"In his address to the nation on the Gulf spill, President Obama spread another kind of oily slick with his misleading rhetoric.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In his usual attempt to glorify himself and to glorify big government, he tried to sell the spill as a “battle we’re waging” and he presented a “battle plan.”                
                

            
                Mr. President, this isn’t a battle as you describe it, and so far you sure haven’t acted like a general who knows what you’re doing. Nor is your “battle plan” the right one.                
                

            
                The oil spill is a huge accident, not a war. Accidents need effective responses. But the president chose a wrong analogy when he compared “the answer…to this challenge…” to “harness[ing] the science and technology to land a man safely on the surface of the moon.”                
                

            
                The oil spill will not be fixed with the science and technology of the Apollo 11 moon landing but with the engineering ingenuity that dealt with the accident on the Apollo 13 moon mission.                
                

            
                The Apollo 13 moon landing was aborted after faulty electrical equipment caused an onboard explosion that ruptured an oxygen tank, limiting the spacecraft’s power, warmth, water and oxygen supplies, and its carbon dioxide removal system. In a race against time, engineers on the ground creatively joined together different pieces of equipment from different parts of the spacecraft. They jury-rigged a hosing connection that properly directed a flow to prevent carbon dioxide from poisoning the lunar module’s environment.                
                

            
                Individuals—not a big government program—addressed the Apollo 13 accident. Individuals—not a big government program—will stop the Gulf oil gusher.                 
                

            
                Yet the president indirectly alluded to the need for yet another big government program—passing his “cap and tax” proposal—as the proper response to the Gulf accident. He said, “The tragedy unfolding on our coast is the most painful and powerful reminder yet that the time to embrace a clean energy future is now.”                
                

            
                Wrong, Mr. President. We need to plug the damn hole in the Gulf now, not use the accident as your political pretext for a government takeover of the energy sector and for the highest tax increase (on energy) in American history.                
                

            
                In November of 2008, White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel defined the Obama Doctrine of big government meddling when he said, ""Never let a serious crisis go to waste. What I mean by that is it's an opportunity to do things you couldn't do before.""                
                

            
                What Emanuel actually meant is, “Never let a serious crisis go away.” Just as the president threw big government interference at health care, he now wants to throw big government interference at our energy supply. He wants to “do things you couldn’t do before” with his clean, green energy dreams, like spending uncontrolled amounts of taxpayer money on “wind turbines…energy-efficient windows…solar panels [and] more efficient cars and trucks.”                
                

            
                Sure, we should encourage the development of alternative energy sources. But what we really need now is the development of clean, safe, reliable and efficient energy that we already have in this country—mainly coal (which new technology is making cleaner) and also untapped oil in places on land, like in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.                 
                

            
                We don’t need boondoggles, government mandates and hundreds of billions of taxpayers dollars thrown at wind, solar and synthetic fuels industries, which can’t give us a fraction of the energy we need now, at the right price—economically or environmentally.                
                

            
                The president used misleading rhetoric when he said that, “Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash American innovation and seize control of our own destiny.”                
                

            
                Unleashing American innovation and seizing control of our own destiny calls for an Apollo 13 approach. Let’s turn individuals—not big government—loose to come up with new and creative ways to expand our energy sources and become more independent of foreign oil. Let’s not use this oil accident to unleash what the French might call “Health Care Reform, Part Deux.”                 
                

            
                Just as Obama used a health care crisis to push through government-controlled, outrageously expensive health care reform that will lead to rationing, he now wants to use an oil spill accident to push through the same effects regarding his green energy chimeras.

                President Obama said, “What sees us through—what has always seen us through—is our strength, our resilience, and our unyielding faith that something better awaits us if we summon the courage to reach for it.”                
                

            
                Mr. President that strength, resilience, faith and courage comes from the ingenuity and enterprise of individuals—not big government.

              Just to be clear: if an emissary of Borut Pahor, President of Slovenia, had emailed Hillary campaign apparatchik John Podesta last summer, offering scandalous dirt on Melania Trump, he would have turned down the meeting? Give me a break.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Politics is a dirty game, and the Clinton campaign engaged in numerous underhanded tricks to defeat not only Bernie Sanders, but also rival Donald Trump. Weeks before the election, videos surfaced showing Clinton campaign workers strategizing on how to infiltrate and disrupt Trump rallies. As the New York Times headline put it: “Videos Put Democrats on Defensive About Dirty Tricks.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              What Donald Trump Jr. did in accepting a meeting with someone supposedly linked to the Russian government was dirty, and stupid, but it is not evidence that his father’s campaign “colluded” with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton. It is evidence, instead, that many involved with the election of Donald Trump were political neophytes, and that the campaign was operating on a shoestring. In a normal campaign, lawyers might have been contacted, red flags would have been issued, and underlings would have taken the meeting. That didn’t happen, in part because there was almost no infrastructure to the Trump campaign.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              That said, having a Russia-linked source offer up “dirt” on Hillary Clinton would have been irresistible. Let us remember what was going on at the time. Russia was indeed a big story during the 2016 election, thanks to Peter Schweizer’s book ""Clinton Cash."" In it, the prize-winning author detailed any number of scandalous situations in which Hillary and Bill Clinton appear to have done favors for political or business allies in exchange for substantial gifts to the Clinton Foundation. Spurred by that best-seller, The Wall Street Journal and others conducted their own investigations into the foundation. The Journal reckoned “…that at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during [Clinton’s] tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation.”
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Outrage over the Clinton Foundation and about Hillary’s evident “pay to play” proclivities was political fodder for Republicans throughout last year, and rightly so. Money actually changed hands between Russian entities and the Clintons, and favors were done. 
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              Among the most shocking of Schweizer’s charges was that Hillary helped win approval for Russia’s state nuclear agency (in other words, a government entity – directed by President Vladimir Putin) to buy a controlling interest in Uranium One, one of America’s largest uranium mines, in exchange for $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. The payments were not made public on the Clinton Foundation website, as was required by an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama administration. Instead, the funds flowed through a Canadian offshoot, the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, and therefore escaped notice.  (Donations to the Canadian affiliate were included in the White House pact, but ignored by Clinton.)
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Mrs. Clinton also “forgot” to mention the donations to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              At roughly the same time, a Russian investment bank staffed with numerous ex-KGB types paid Bill Clinton a $500,000 speaking fee, causing a New Yorker writer to ask, “Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was secretary of state?”  Does this resonate? Will Special Counsel Robert Mueller ask the same question? He certainly should.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The uranium deal was important, in that it concerned a large stock of a U.S. strategic asset. Also, the Kremlin had made expanding its access to uranium globally a high priority because it was hard at work building nuclear power plants such as the Bushehr facilities in Iran and similar projects in North Korea and Venezuela. In other words, the Uranium One purchase significantly boosted Russia’s business and diplomatic prospects. As a result, the deal raised national security concerns; numerous Congressmen had petitioned to block the purchase, which nonetheless took place.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Outrage over the Clinton Foundation and about Hillary’s evident “pay to play” proclivities was political fodder for Republicans throughout last year, and rightly so. Money actually changed hands between Russian entities and the Clintons, and favors were done. In that context, Donald Trump Jr. was approached by a Russian source who promised incriminating evidence about Hillary. Who wouldn’t jump at the chance?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              There are important challenges facing our country. You wouldn’t know it from following the mainstream media, caught up as they are in faux scandals and the ever-lasting “Russia” story. Democrats and their allies in the press cannot and will not move on from the investigations into Trump’s presumed ties to the Kremlin, even if it hurts the country. To do so would legitimatize the Trump presidency, and focus voters’ attentions on the popular White House agenda – health care reform, lower taxes, infrastructure spending, protected borders, a stronger military and a roll-back of decades of suffocating red tape. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats cannot afford that. They especially cannot afford to have Americans looking for their answers to our challenges – they don’t have any. Which is why Donald Trump, and not Hillary Clinton, is president.

Buckle Up for Wild Ride In 2010,"I remember the day the Democrats lost Congress in 1994. It was as if we were about to attend many funerals at once. The Democrats set up an outplacement organization at DNC headquarters, where many Congressional staff members could apply for jobs all over the country. I don't expect that this year's midterm elections will be quite the tsunami that ’94 was, but what is about to take place in 2010 symbolizes a strong lesson about power and political control.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The storm that is brewing won’t hit Democrats alone. Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer has already announced that he, too, is resigning. Many are attributing this to the Tea Party contingent within the state that believes he operates too much from a consensus middle. The majority of high school civics classes teach the concept that most politics is cyclical, and this is no exception. However, due to the 24-hour news cycle, blogs and the availability of opinion, we are seeing political mood swings from a large part of the population. Ben Franklin once said, “a week is a long time in politics,” and that was before the invention of cable news, the Internet, fax machines and cell phones!                
                

            
                Microphones magnify any message -- as does video on YouTube. If Connecticut Democrat Senator Chris Dodd even appears to receive VIP status on a mortgage -- whether true or false -- it gets amplified everywhere. Radio talk show hosts like Scott Hennen have been banging away day and night at Byron Dorgan on his local “Common Sense Club” show. It is hard for a Democrat in a red state to stay in office. Senator Dorgan, who just announced he will retire this year, is a perfect example.                
                

            
                Some Democrats, like Harry Reid, are simply victims of circumstance. After Senator Reid became Majority Leader, his state began to experience huge foreclosure problems and large unemployment figures. Due to that, it has become nearly impossible for him to look like any sort of hero. Nancy Pelosi is doing what it takes in the rough and tumble world of politics, but as a woman, she has been and will continue to be, typecast as a ""shrew"" by her political opponents. Speaker Pelosi would be wise to start running some ads exposing the Republicans’ lack of a plan to fix the nation’s health care system before it’s too late.                
                

            
                I thought I had lived through the most interesting years in politics during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. But, it’s looking increasingly likely that 2010 is going to be a wild ride. I believe the Democrats will lose roughly 23 seats in the House, and 3 or 4 more in the Senate. Losing all those House seats made Bill Clinton a much more responsive politician, and it may do the same for President Obama. America likes to be governed from the middle, and not from the outer limits of either wing.                
                

            
                In light of the upcoming midterms elections President Obama finds himself in a bit of a bind: He must make good on certain promises he made during his campaign, such as passing climate legislation and allowing gays to serve openly in the military. Failure to do so would create the same problem he capitalized on in 2008, which is that loyal Democrats will stay home on Election Day. On the other hand, he must find a way to appease the party moderates. Rather than moving hastily to immigration reform and more spending, he should follow health care reform by passing feel-good legislation that will ensure that Blue Dogs and the middle part of the party show up to vote for Democrats in November. That is really the only chance Democrats have of not getting blown out in 2010.

"Sen. John McCain: You were fed ObamaCare lies, America. Here's what must happen now","Now Playing                            As ObamaCare premiums rise, so does cost to taxpayers                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                As the old adage goes, “If you don’t change your direction, you’re likely to end up where you’re headed.” When it comes to health care in America, Democrats’ refusal to change course on ObamaCare – even as it crumbles across the country – will lead us to more skyrocketing costs and decreased quality of care.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This week, the Obama administration confirmed that monthly premiums for benchmark plans are set to rise by an average of 25 percent in the 39 states participating in ObamaCare’s federal marketplace. About one-in-five consumers will have just one provider to choose from.                
                

            
                As bad as these numbers are, they don’t paint the full picture of the burdens many across the country will face come open enrollment next week.                  
                

            
                In my home state of Arizona, a 27-year-old shopping for benchmark plans will see their premiums rise by an average 116 percent. For Arizonans selecting other plans, the situation is just as bad, with premiums set to increase by 51 to 74.5 percent.

                In Maricopa County – Arizona’s most populous county, which includes the city of Phoenix – the 126,000 citizens who have enrolled in ObamaCare will only have one health provider option. According to state regulators, that would mean more than $1,400 per month for a family of four and nearly $500 per month for a middle age man for a benchmark silver plan. Those who can’t afford these expensive plans will be forced to pay a penalty.                
                

            
                This is a far cry from the promise of more “choice, more competition, [and] real health care security,” that President Obama once declared.                
                

            
                When the president and Congressional Democrats traveled the country touting their so-called “Affordable Care Act” back in 2009, my Republican colleagues and I were quick to highlight that their proposals, however well-intentioned, would only make health care worse for American families. It doesn’t take a Ph.D. to recognize that injecting unprecedented levels of government control into what amounts to nearly one-fifth of the nation’s economy would have devastating consequences.                
                

            
                But Democrats dismissed these warnings – demonizing opponents of the law as partisan fear-mongers. The President assured us, “If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.” He said, “No one will take it away, no matter what.”                
                

            
                We now know those promises turned out to be lies. As is his pledge that with a few small tweaks and a new so-called public option, ObamaCare will be on a smooth path forward.                
                

            
                American families are demanding greater affordability and accessibility when it comes to their health care. They are calling for more choice and competition in the health insurance marketplace. And they are urging their leaders to challenge the status quo – not act as rubber stamps for unworkable policies, as my Democratic opponent in the campaign for Arizona Senate promises to do by defending ObamaCare, her “proudest vote.”                
                

            
                Contrary to the president’s misleading claim in Miami last week, Republicans in Congress are already working to reform this broken system and have introduced numerous pieces of legislation to replace ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Just in this current Congress, Senator David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Congressman Tom Price (R-Ga.) and I introduced the Empowering Patients First Act, which would replace ObamaCare with patient-centered policies that would actually lower costs and increase competition for consumers.                
                

            
                We’d do this by establishing age-adjusted tax credits, providing economic incentives to purchase coverage, and allow people to purchase insurance across state lines. All of this and more can be accomplished while ensuring no one is priced-out of the market if they have a pre-existing condition.                
                

            
                If we don’t change direction soon, we are likely to end up where we are headed – to even higher health care costs, less choices and decreased quality of care.                
                

            
                The surest way to alter the dangerous course we are on would be at the ballot box by sending Republican majorities back to Congress who are committed to repealing and replacing this failed law.                
                

            
                We need leaders who will fight for health care reform that works by putting patients first.                
                

            

            
                
                    
                
                


 

	Republican John McCain represents Arizona in the United States Senate."
Saving Medicare By Killing It,"“Dire Forecast Sparks New Medicare Debate” was the headline… June 6, 1996. In fact, according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn, Medicare’s immediate extinction has been predicted no fewer than 18 times in the last 40 years. When it serves their political interests, the Chicken Littles from both parties squawk about how the nation’s insanely popular (albeit effectively socialized) medical system is going to go broke any moment.

The fact that none of these predictions has ever come true is not stopping Republicans today. They are using the latest Medicare trust fund forecasts to make a truly sick argument: Medicare might be in trouble eventually so, just to be safe, we’re going to destroy it now.

The facts are not in dispute. The Republican budget plan will double the out-of-pocket cost that seniors pay for health care by 2022. Meanwhile, instead of participating in a large government-backed group plan that brings with it economies of scale cost-wise, seniors will be left on their own to negotiate individually with private insurance companies. The “savings” from the Republican plan will partly go to the insurance industry in the form of vouchers and the rest will go to tax breaks for the richest of the rich.

In fact, the Republican budget which is being pushed under the guise that our nation’s deficit has reached a crisis point, will only reduce the deficit by 0.16% over the next 10 years. Over 70% of the “savings” from slashing Medicare and other public programs that help working families will go not to paying down our debt but, rather, giving more tax breaks to the rich. The same people who, according to several independent sources, are paying lower taxes than most ordinary Americans --- and paying the lowest overall tax rate in at least the last century.

It’s hard to now see Republicans, who have attacked Medicare since its very inception, now pretending to defend it. If Republicans had really wanted to strengthen Medicare, they might have supported at least one of the 60 pieces of legislation over the past 10 years to make the program better. Or they might have supported President Obama’s health care reform legislation, which will strengthen Medicare (and improve trust fund forecasts) but cutting excessive spending by 25%.

Frankly, the only thing that will be healthier under the Republican plan will be the bank accounts of insurance executives. Because their profits aren’t already high enough, they’ll now get government subsidies.

If Chicken Little had been a life-long anti-sky activist hell bent on destroying the atmosphere, even fictitious characters would have been nuts to believe her when she screamed about the sky falling, seeing right through her self-serving tricks.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Similarly, since Republicans have spent most of their political existence railing against government in general and Medicare in specific, we’d be crazy to trust them to honestly diagnose the situation --- let alone solve it. After all, the Republican leaders are as genuinely concerned about the long-term health of Medicare as profit-hungry insurance corporations are concerned about your health.

CBO vs. HHS: Guesswork vs. proven history on the harm ObamaCare has done,"As the media trumpeted news recently of the Congressional Budget Office score on the American Health Care Act, they largely ignored data released by the Department of Health and Human Services outlining the damage done by ObamaCare.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                In my home state of North Carolina, average premiums on the individual market have gone up by $422 per month, or more than $5,000 a year, since 2013.  Consider the impact on someone with a $50,000 salary.  Making matters worse, 95 out of 100 counties in North Carolina have only one carrier – Blue Cross & Blue Shield, and even BCBS seriously considered pulling out last year.  Aetna, Humana, and United Healthcare have also pulled out of ObamaCare markets nationwide. 
                
                


                
            
                The results in North Carolina are not anomalies.  Nationwide, average premiums have gone up by nearly $3,000 under ObamaCare.  Quite the opposite from what President Obama promised when he said a typical family’s premiums would go down by $2,500.
                
                


                
            
                As far as choices go, last year one third of all counties nationwide had only one insurer offering coverage through ObamaCare.  That is nearly 2 million Americans who were only able to pick from one health insurer.  And the situation is only getting worse.  Recently, Blue Cross announced it will pull out of 32 counties in Kansas and Missouri, potentially leaving 25 of those counties with no coverage in 2018.
                
                


                
            
                These are the facts of what we know has happened thanks to ObamaCare.
                
                


                
            
                Ironically, while the Health and Human Services report is based on facts, the Congressional Budget Office report only provides unsupported conclusions, as it is based on highly questionable predictions.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                With best efforts, the CBO report is elusive in its prediction of outcomes.  Just take the CBO’s word for it.  On page 32, the CBO report states:  “estimates are inherently uncertain because the ways in which federal agencies, states, insurers, employers, individuals, doctors, hospitals, and other affected parties would respond to the changes made by the legislation are all difficult to predict.”
                
                


                
            
                The report continues:  “predicting the overall effects of the myriad ways that states could implement those waivers is especially difficult.”
                
                


                
            
                Their caution is well-founded.  A review of the CBO’s ObamaCare projections reveals how flawed their prediction models on health care have been.  Discussions around these predictions include a lot of numbers, acronyms, and technical language, but anyone can see from the CBO’s record that their analysis is far from gold.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO estimated 23 million people would enroll in the ObamaCare exchanges by 2016.  The actual number was around 10 million.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO predicted 4 million people would enroll in an ObamaCare small business program.  The actual number is 233,000.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO claimed the ObamaCare risk corridor program would result in a profit of $8 billion for the government.  The program ended up with a multibillion dollar deficit because ObamaCare was never actuarially sound.  To ensure this didn’t result in a massive taxpayer bailout of big insurance companies, I wrote a letter to HHS last October, co-signed by 45 additional Members of Congress, emphasizing the full commitment of Congress to block any backdoor bailout of ObamaCare losses.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO projected Medicaid expansion would cost $42 billion.  The actual cost was $68 billion.
                
                


                
            
                These facts speak for themselves and beg for a reality check.
                
                


                
            
                While the CBO score is of limited value, their report is clear that the American Health Care Act will reduce premiums and also reduce the deficit by $119 billion.
                
                


                
            
                But setting aside projection models, at the heart of the debate over ObamaCare is a fundamental question regarding the federal government’s role in health care.  Should the government require every individual to buy health insurance?  Of course not, and naturally, when you repeal a mandate to purchase something, fewer folks will ultimately buy it.
                
                


                
            
                The ObamaCare approach - top-down, one-size-fits-all health care for everyone - clearly has not worked.  The result has been higher premiums, higher deductibles and fewer choices.
                
                


                
            
                The American Health Care Act approach, on the other hand, gives states flexibility and puts patients back in control of their health care.  This will allow Americans to choose the coverage best for them and their family.
                
                


                
            
                The Senate will surely make its changes to the bill, and the House will certainly have our say on those changes, but Republicans are united in our fundamental principles for health care reform.  We need to rescue our health care system from the ObamaCare death spiral and establish patient-centered, market-driven solutions to lower costs while protecting those with pre-existing conditions.  The American Health Care Act will deliver on these principles.

Progressives must hold Obama accountable for NSA phone spying,"FILE- In this Dec. 8, 2005, file photo, a man walks out the Verizon's new corporate headquarters(AP Photo/Dima Gavrysh, File)

                Friday, the New York Times published an editorial about the recent revelation that our federal government is collecting broad data on the phone calls made by Americans, writing that the Obama administration “has now lost all credibility on this issue.”                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This is significant not because liberal voices and institutions have failed to criticize the president before.                 
                

            
                To the contrary, the New York Times editorial board and others have been quite vocal on condemning the drone program, aggressive investigations of journalists in leak probes, record deportations of immigrant families and more.

                But largely because of our hyper-partisan climate and the unrelenting, politically-motivated attacks against President Obama from the right, many liberals and progressives have been reluctant to throw down strong gauntlets before the administration. But the times, and the Times, are changing.

                The problem with hyper-partisanship is that those on both sides constantly defend their own camp and attack the other with little regard for history, logic or ideology.                 
                

            
                Republicans condemn the individual mandate in health care reform while Democrats rationalize drone warfare.                 
                

            
                Conservatives who ran up the deficit under Republican presidents call deficit spending reckless when led by Democrats. And progressives who in previous decades were leading skeptics about the “big brother” power of government cow in complacency to defend the creeping and creepy expansion of government intrusion in our lives.                
                

            
                Conservatives, progressives, Democrats, Republicans — we’ve all fallen into the trap of turning a blind eye to our own side’s abuses while fairly blindly hurling accusations at the other. This stops now.                
                

            
                Wednesday night, hours after it was revealed that the National Security Agency has been collecting phone records of a large swath of the American public for apparently at least seven years, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee launched a petition to immediately investigate and release all its findings to the public.                
                

            
                I whole-heartedly back that call. Those of us who opposed the strategy and scope of the Patriot Act when it originated under President Bush must just as firmly denounce it use and abuse under President Obama.                
                

            
                Not all Democrats have remained silent. I, and many others, have already called recent developments, particularly the secret subpoenaing of broad records from AP and Fox News reporters, deeply disturbing. And the fantastic reporter Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian, who broke the story about our government collecting Verizon phone records and Internet data, is a progressive.                
                

            
                Nor should we ignore that, in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder last year, Democratic Senators Mark Udall (Colorado) and Ron Wyden (Oregon) wrote, “We believe most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of. . .these secret court opinions. As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows.” Udall told the Denver Post Thursday that it did everything short of leaking classified information” to bring attention to what the NSA was doing.                
                

            
                But the willingness to critique President Obama has often been understandably tempered by a fear of playing into the Republican desire to blow up concerns into controversies and bring down the Obama administration by any means necessary.                
                

            
                Flagrant overreach laced with conspiracy theories, from Fast and Furious to Benghazi, reveal that Republicans are no longer invested in leading the role of legitimate oversight but the circus act of political destruction.                
                

            
                Those who generally support President Obama’s ideas and objectives are understandably wary to simultaneously criticize the president when he falls short on our ideals, lest our critiques be used as extra bricks in the partisan campaign to sink his ship.                
                

            
                All of these concerns are legitimate. I, and no one on the left, wants our substantive critiques of the Obama administration to inadvertently play into the viciously anti-Obama agenda of the right which is fueled by a deep hatred for the president that has deeper and darker origins than policy differences alone.                
                

            
                Yet still, there are moments where we are called on to be citizens first, and partisans second.                
                

            
                Progressives don’t want to bring down the president, but we do want to hold him accountable. And it is the job of we, the people, to hold our government accountable.                
                

            
                The recent revelations about the scale and scope of government surveillance on the American people should concern all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike.                
                

            
                The fact that the collection of vast phone records that apparently began under President Bush and was continued by President Obama may be a sufficiently bipartisan offense to coalesce a bipartisan opposition. Let’s hope that Americans of all political stripes can join together to demand transparency and accountability from our government and ensure that the desire to protect our safety is never a justification for attacking our liberties.

On MLK Day -- A look at race and the 2012 presidential campaign,"It is Martin Luther King Day, and a good time to look at how racial politics is being played this year when the first black president in U.S. history is seeking reelection.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The big news about racial politics in 2012 is that generational politics are now a critical factor in any analysis of America’s longstanding racial divide.                
                

            
                Young people, disproportionately minorities and immigrants, are growing in numbers. These people of color, younger than 18, are already a quarter of the population. And when you add in people under age 32, younger people make up half of the nation. They are big fans of Democrats and President Obama.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, those 65 and older constitute only about 15 percent of the population. But they are overwhelmingly white and much more politically active. They don’t like Obama. They are a boon to the GOP.                
                

            
                Those white seniors don’t like being branded as racists for their dislike of the first black president, but as Time magazine recently reported, the seniors’ disapproval of the black president is “dramatically higher” than among younger white people.                
                

            
                A Pew poll showed voters younger than 30 favored Obama over the probable GOP nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 61 percent to 37 percent. Seniors favored Romney over Obama, 54 percent to 41 percent.                
                

            
                That Grand Canyon-wide gap between more racially diverse younger Americans and solidly white older Americans is also evident in every analysis of public reaction to Obama’s signature legislation — health care reform. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found a stunning 50 percent of seniors opposed to the plan.                
                

            
                On the other side of the racial and political divide, there is little chance that black voters will support a 92 percent white Republican Party trying to oust the first black president. The GOP’s only hope among the ever-increasing number of young and minority voters is to win over the fastest growing racial group in the United States — Hispanics.                
                

            
                A Pew Hispanic Center survey showed Democrats currently hold a 47-point party-identification advantage with Hispanic voters, the biggest gap in more than a decade. The same survey also found Hispanics favoring Obama over Romney, 68 percent to 23 percent. And this was way before Romney announced he would veto the DREAM Act, which some polls show is supported by 91 percent of Hispanics.                
                

            
                Obama won 67 percent of the Hispanic vote and 95 percent of the black vote in 2008. It is very likely he will retain or even increase those shares in 2012.                
                

            
                The increasing presence of Hispanics, blacks and immigrants in the electorate means a constant infusion of likely Democratic voters in this election and beyond. The increasingly critical role of Hispanic voters explains the enthusiasm in the GOP for drafting Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a young Hispanic, as the party’s vice presidential candidate this year.                
                

            
                It also explains why the GOP is trying to depress Hispanic and black voter turnout. Racial politics has a long history in South Carolina — it is the state where Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was falsely accused of having fathered a black child out of wedlock. And who would have predicted that in the heat of the campaign, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) would be willing to appear on the same stage with the leading black Democrat in the state, Rep. James Clyburn.                
                

            
                Last year, South Carolina followed the lead of several other GOP-controlled states by enacting new laws to require voters to show government-issued photo identification to get into the polling booth. The new law has been blocked by the Justice Department under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, one of the most important victories of Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement.                
                

            
                It was aimed at the sad history of black voter disenfranchisement — from poll taxes to literacy tests — that made politics a whites-only game in states such as South Carolina for most of our nation’s history.                
                

            
                A study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University found that the new voter identification laws disproportionately affect minorities and young people. In other words, they prevent likely Democratic voters from voting. The study estimated that all these new state laws, taken together, could disenfranchise more than 5 million voters — 25 percent of African Americans don’t have the kind of photo identification that states like South Carolina now require for voting.                
                

            
                South Carolina’s own statistics indicate that 82,000 registered minority voters lack state-issued identification.                
                

            
                Make no mistake about it. This concerted effort by Republicans to disenfranchise Democratic voters is their brazen reaction to the rise of black and Hispanic voters as the lifeblood of the Democratic Party and Obama’s chances for reelection.                
                

            
                I believe if Dr. King were alive he’d be marching against this politically motivated assault on minority voting rights.

The Post Office Comparison,"Tuesday: President Obama addresses an audience in New Hampshire on health care (Reuters).
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                One of the most hotly debated parts of President Obama's plan to change health care in America is the so-called ""public option.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Opponents of the public option regard it as a government-subsidized, government-administered program that will, eventually, drive private companies out of the insurance business. Supporters of the idea describe it as a way to insure that every American has the ability to access the healthcare system and that forcing the private insurers to compete with the public program will keep them honest by providing ""real competition.""                
                

            
                Who's right? Well, fortunately for all of us, there exists a real world parallel that may help us to better evaluate the potential ramifications of the public option for health care and for private insurance. It's called the United States Post Office, which has to compete with United Parcel Service (""Big Brown""), Federal Express, DHL and other ""overnight"" carriers and, with ever increasing frequency, e-mail as the message and media delivery system of choice for the American people.                
                

            
                Now, according to the supporters of the president's approach to health care reform, mail delivery in the United States should be on a more or less a level playing field, with the U.S. Post Office (the ""public option"") providing real competition to its private sector competitors. But we all know this is not the case; even President Obama, who said Tuesday in New Hampshire ""If you think about it, UPS and FedEx are doing just fine, right? No, they are. It's the Post Office that is always having problems.""                
                

            
                The president is, at least in this case, correct. The Post Office is always having problems, like the fact that it consistently runs over its budget, it has an upward-spiraling debt lode that is nearing is statutory debt limit over the same period of time that the price of a stamp has risen by 33 percent over the last ten years.                
                

            
                It's not surprising that, according to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, the U.S. Post Office received an average customer services rating of 74 percent while its two main private competitors, FedEx and UPS, received scores of 84 and 82 percent respectively.                
                

            
                Oh yeah. One more thing: The government has ""rigged the system"" in the Post Office's favor.                
                

            
                Under federal law the Post Office is the only entity allowed to put anything -- first class mail, periodicals, commercial flyers or even personal notes to friends -- through a mail slot or in a mailbox, which for years provided them a competitive advantage over, let's say local delivery services. The Post Office also will not allow private carriers to deliver anything to an official USPS Post Office Box.                
                

            
                UPS, FedEx and the other ""express mail"" companies have to pay taxes on the money they bring in the door, on their planes, on their trucks and the rest of their property. The Post Office doesn't. And, unlike its private competitors, the Post Office gets bailed out, from time to time, by the U.S. taxpayers -- although, thanks to the Obama approach to General Motors and Chrysler, public bailouts of private corporations may become more common in the future.                
                

            
                On parcel and express mail services, the USPS sets a mandatory minimum price that a private shipper can charge and it is mandated by law to be higher than what the USPS charges. It also does everything it can to regulate, raise prices and make things less convenient for consumers who want to use private parcel shipping and mail delivery locations -- in effecting trying to make the Mail Boxes, Etc. model function more like, well, more like the Post Office. And with all that, with all those comparative advantages built into the system on its behalf, people still don't like the Post Office as much as FedEx and its still hemorrhaging money.                
                

            
                It is not at all a certainty that a government-influenced ""public option"" health care system would function exactly like the Post Office. But it's fair to say the comparison raises some fair questions that need to be answered regarding how such a health care system would function compared to the one we have now; questions that need to be answered before legislation is voted on and before the new system becomes law. And it was President Obama, in his remarks in New Hampshire, who invited that comparison.

Does the 'Reconciliation' Gambit Make You Angry?,"ADVERTISEMENT                     Does the ‘Reconciliation’ Gambit Make You Angry?Yes. This is outrageous! They’re using rules to bypass the clear voice of the people – payback in November, guys.
Not sure, but if they have to resort to rules loopholes to pass a law, doesn’t that indicate that a lot of people oppose it?
No. Look, we need health care reform and we need it now. Let’s get started, even if it means using a rules loophole.

Why Won't Obama Hear Our Call?,"In a speech at the University of Denver in 2008 just days before the Super Tuesday primaries, then-Senator Barack Obama said :                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                ‘‘Democrats will win in November and build a majority in Congress not by nominating a candidate who will unite the other party against us, but by choosing one who can unite this country around a movement for change.”                
                

            
                Well, a year into his presidency Obama finds Republicans -- in both houses of Congress -- as well as moderate and independent voters, united against his expensive and unpopular agenda, and he made it clear that the White House is ""not hitting a reset button at all,"" as his adviser Valerie Jarrett asserted on “Meet the Press” in an interview that previewed many of the themes and rationales that were in Obama’s State of the Union address.                 
                

            
                So the pundits who predicted Obama would pivot, move to the center and admit his mistakes were wrong:                
                

            
                As USA Today’s Chuck Raasch notes:                
                

            
                Obama reaffirmed his core policies and principles and pivoted to a more robust public relations offensive to defend both his record and his ideas as he sought to regain both legislative momentum and public confidence.

He reminded his national audience of the state of the union he inherited a year ago, with record deficits and a spiraling economy, and in plain language defended his actions and pushed for more: a jobs bill, tax credits for small business, clean energy spending, a freeze on a small part of the federal budget, and most significantly, passage of health care reform.

In some ways, it was an extension of his campaign platform a year into his presidency.

'""I never said change would be easy,"" he said, rekindling his Change You Can Believe In campaign slogan. ""Let's seize this moment to start anew.""                
                

            
                Anyone seeking a course correction in the 69-minute address likely came away disappointed.                
                

            
                What Steven Thomma of McClatchy Newspapers heard is “a Reaganesque mantra: Stay the course”:                
                

            
                Sure, Obama tried to tap into the voter anger and anxiety about the economy in his first State of the Union address, hoping to channel it rather than being overrun by it, as the Democratic Party in Massachusetts was last week. He added some new proposals, such as $30 billion to small banks to encourage lending and tax breaks for small businesses, calling them just more steps in his plan to grow the economy and create jobs. He also vowed to start reining in soaring budget deficits.                
                

            
                Yet despite the stinging defeat his party suffered in Massachusetts, the erosion of his own political support and calls from Republicans and moderate Democrats to change his agenda, Obama signaled that he'll make no abrupt turn from the path he set more than a year ago.                
                

            
                As The Washington Times presciently pointed out a couple of days before Obama’s State of the Union address:                 
                

            
                “Mr. Obama is in a state of denial. His party's losses in Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts all sent the message that the American people want the party in power to govern more wisely. … Mr. Obama pledges to keep on fighting, but pushing harder for ruinously bad policies is not populism; it is political suicide.”                
                

            
                Three other things that didn’t change:                
                

            
                1. Continuing to blame President George Bush                
                

            
                ""One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. … By the time I took office, we had a one year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. That was before I walked in the door.""                
                

            
                The only thing Obama gave Bush credit for was the bank bailout program that “we all hated” and “was about as popular as a root canal.”                
                

            
                2. Self-absorption and false modesty                
                

            
                ""I know the anxieties that are out there right now. … These struggles are the reason I ran for president. These struggles are what I've witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana and Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. … when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn't just do what was popular I would do what was necessary … From the day I took office, I have been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious that such efforts would be too contentious, that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for awhile. … I did not choose to tackle [healthcare] to get some legislative victory under my belt. … Now, I am not nave. I never thought the mere fact of my election would usher in peace, harmony, and some post-partisan era.”                
                

            
                I, I, I. Even the towns Obama cites are in states that begin with “I.” It’s his favorite letter, isn’t it?                
                

            
                3. Not owning up to his mistakes                
                

            
                Rather than admitting the mistakes that stalled his agenda, Obama deflected responsibility for his failure to lead to not only ""Wall Street,"" and ""Republicans,"" but also to Washington pundits:                
                

            
                [W]hat frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. … But it is precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it is sowing further division among our citizens and further distrust in our government. … If the Republican leadership is going to insist that sixty votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town, then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it's not leadership. … [E]ach time a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people's doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates into silly arguments, and big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away. … I campaigned on the promise of change, change we can believe in … I never suggested that change would be easy, or that I can do it alone. … Our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved.""                
                

            
                The closest Obama came to acknowledging that he has fallen short in any way came in this passage:                
                

            
                ""I take my share of the blame for not explaining [healthcare] more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most Americans wondering what's in it for them. … We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security, and swifter action on our intelligence"".                
                

            
                Obama started his address with a brief retrospective of rocky periods in the nation’s history, and said: “Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history's call.”                
                

            
                This time, though, it is about him. Obama is the one being tested. The takeaway message from the elections in Virginia, New Jersey and Massachusetts is that rather than pursuing a sweeping agenda like FDR’s New Deal and Johnson’s Great Society, Obama needs to answer the call of the American people who want smaller government, lower taxes and deficit reduction. Will he ever pick up the ringing phone?

                I’m a Hillary Clinton fangirl and I feel no shame.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                She was the most qualified candidate to run for president in history – we all should be Hillary Clinton fangirls.                
                

            
                Does that mean I don’t see her faults? Of course not.                
                

            
                She had a flawed message (I’ll get back to you when I figure out what “stronger together” actually means). She had a private email server and bungled the explanation. She didn’t surround herself with new faces on the campaign trail. She didn’t go to Wisconsin. She didn’t learn valuable lessons from the primary about sentiment within the white working class community. She overplayed the gender card, even with the role of misogyny in the election which was very real and powerful.                
                

            
                I could go on and I could certainly also discuss the bizarre twists that undoubtedly hurt Clinton on November 8th. They include, but are not limited to, the role of FBI Director James Comey, Russian interference, Anthony Weiner’s sexting scandal, an overblown server scandal and viral rightwing media (I’m looking at you “performance artist” Alex Jones) that spread lies and disinformation about Clinton.                
                

            
                But the reality is that obsessing over what Clinton and her team got wrong distracts from the real issue at hand: the Trump presidency.                
                

            
                Soon President Donald Trump will have been in office for 100 days and with very little to show for it.                
                

            
                He’s failed twice to push through his controversial travel ban, feeling the impact of an independent judiciary, outside groups and security experts. The de facto Muslim ban pulled at the heartstrings of Americans on both sides of the aisle who were horrified when he first floated the idea on the campaign trail - “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,” his statement said – as there’s little more American than freedom of religion.                
                

            
                The American Health Care Act crashed and burned in spectacular fashion. Majority of the blame rests on Paul Ryan’s shoulders as he let his ego get ahead of good policy, public sentiment and the numbers. What good is a Speaker who can’t deliver his caucus? President Trump learned the hard way that there are actually principled conservatives (shocked this Democrat, too!)                
                

            
                It looks like tax reform is going to have to wait until after health care reform, a dangerous move for Trump as the promise of a big fat tax cut pulled Republicans and Independents who were uneasy about him into his camp. Voters wanted a tax cut even more than the wall at the Southern border.                 
                

            
                And while we’re on the subject, there is no wall.                 
                

            
                Trump promised to drain the swamp and instead filled the White House with bankers from Goldman Sachs and his own family. Can you imagine the outrage if pictures of Chelsea Clinton sitting next to Angela Merkel were making the rounds? Or if Chelsea won a trademark in China after having dinner with President Xi? I can’t even.                
                

            
                ""I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That is what we have the White House for,"" GOP Senator Joni Ernst commented. ""We would love to see more of those State Department visits in Washington D.C. I have not spoken to him about the Florida issue yet, but that is something I think has been bothering not just me, but I think other members of our caucus.” That’s right, the guy who criticized President Obama for nonstop golfing can’t stop golfing – on our dime. His party is noticing.                
                

            
                What’s more, of 554 positions that require Senate confirmation, 473 are still without a nominee and only 22 have been confirmed. That isn’t just Democrat obstruction. That’s Trump.                
                

            
                Then there’s the flip flopping. On NATO, on the Fed, on intervention, on Chinese currency manipulation. And that was just one day!                
                

            
                Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why the president’s approval rating continues to hover in the low 40s, even with majority approval for his actions in Syria (Americans split on posturing with North Korea).                
                

            
                Moreover, I’ll spare you a diatribe on rolling back worker and environmental protections – you know what I’m thinking.                
                

            
                In the plus column, the stock market is still performing well and consumer confidence remains high. Elections are won and lost on the economy and that’s where Trump could prove the haters wrong. But without a comprehensive tax plan and the numbers to get it passed – debt hawks are going to be a tough sell especially if Trump deals on infrastructure with Democrats – we’re looking at the potential for a lame duck presidency.                
                

            
                So candidate Trump sold America a bad bill of goods and they bought it. Now we’re getting a bad bill of goods from President Trump. Clinton surely had something to do with that and we’ll continue re-hashing how it all went so wrong until the end of time (or at least the next four years).                
                

            
                But to return to the original point here, I’m a Hillary Clinton fangirl and we should all take note of the message of her concession speech. After taking 8 hours to collect herself, Clinton told her supporters – and all of America – “Last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.”                 
                

            
                I remember her message every time President Trump does something that makes my jaw hit the floor. It’s going to take us all working together. That starts with the occupant of the highest office in the world and trickles down to each and every one of us.                
                

            
                So to all the fangirls out there, we can still love Hillary and make this work. Four years isn’t that long.

"In Utah, GOP finds new Love","File: 2012: Utah GOP House candidate Mia Love the Republican National Convention, in Tampa, Fla.
	                        
	                        	 (REUTERS )
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The most intriguing political race of 2012 is a congressional campaign hidden away in central Utah. Republicans are in full attack mode against the only Democrat in Utah’s congressional delegation.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                No surprise that the Republican candidate is a Mormon. The surprise is that she is a black woman.                
                

            
                As the Washington Post noted in a recent profile of 37-year-old Mia Love: “If she wins, not only would she help Republicans keep control of the House, but she would become the first black Republican woman to serve in Congress. Love, who is Mormon, also could go a long way toward helping presidential candidate Mitt Romney, putting a fresh face on his church and his Party as both try to appeal to an increasingly diverse nation.”                
                

            
                Those dynamics help to explain why a little congressional race in Utah is getting a lot of attention in Washington. Love has already been endorsed by GOP heavyweights like Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy and Ann Romney.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                Love is running against Jim Matheson, a six-term Democratic incumbent who serves on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is the co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of conservative and moderate Democrats in Congress known for bucking their party’s leadership.                
                

            
                The last remaining Democrat in the Utah delegation, Matheson won his 2010 re-election race by less than 5 points.                
                

            
                Because of population gains, Utah gained a fourth congressional seat after the 2010 census and the GOP-dominated state legislature has redistricted Matheson into the new district with even more registered Republicans.                
                

            
                Moderates in Congress are fast becoming an endangered species – on both sides of the aisle.                
                

            
                According to the 2010 National Journal Rankings, Matheson was more conservative than 51 percent of his colleagues in the House and more liberal than 49 percent. This makes him one of the most centrist members of Congress.                
                

            
                In 2008, there were 56 Blue Dogs – conservative Democrats -- in the House. After the 2010 elections, there were only 26.                
                

            
                To strengthen his conservative credentials, Matheson voted against President Obama’s health care reform law and voted in favor of holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over Fast and Furious. It seems to be working for him.                
                

            
                A June poll from Desert News/KSL showed Matheson leading Love by 15 points. The incumbent also has a commanding lead in fundraising with more than $1 million dollars in his campaign war chest.                
                

            
                But keep in mind that Love only locked up the GOP nomination at the state convention in April. The amount of money she has collected since then has been roughly equal to what Matheson has raised.                
                

            
                Love is attracting national attention as the conservative mayor of Saratoga Springs and one of the few African-Americans in Utah. The state has a 1.3 percent black population compared to the nation’s 13 percent black population.                
                

            
                If Love wins, she will instantly become a conservative celebrity – a new face for conservatism and a lure for the GOP to use to recruit more candidates who are female and persons of color.                
                

            
                Like Marco Rubio, her parents are immigrants and she is uniquely qualified to reach out to the growing immigrant population who views the GOP as hostile.                
                

            
                If elected, Love will join Reps. Allen West of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina as black Republican members of the House. Love does not mouth West's fiery Tea Party rhetoric. But there is no doubt that she is a strong conservative.                
                

            
                She is pro-life, pro-gun and favors eliminating the Department of Education and the Department of Energy.                 
                

            
                She also says that she would like to join the Congressional Black Caucus so that she can ""try to take that thing apart from the inside out” because, according to her, ""They sit there and ignite emotions and ignite racism when there isn’t. They use their positions to instill fear. Hope and change is turned into fear and blame. Fear that everybody is going to lose everything and blaming Congress for everything instead of taking responsibility.""                
                

            
                The daughter of Haitian immigrants, Love could well be the messenger that the GOP has been waiting for to rebuild and rebrand themselves a forward-looking party with fresh new ideas for a changing, diverse electorate.                
                

            
                On the campaign trail, Love recounts how her father told her on the day of her college orientation:  “Mia, your mother and I never took a handout. You will not be a burden to society.”                
                

            
                Both of her parents worked very hard, with her father taking on a second job as a janitor to put their three children through school.                
                

            
                Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Love worked her way through college and graduated from the University of Hartford. She also worked as a flight attendant for Continental Airlines.                
                

            
                In her endorsement, Ann Romney called her an “example for Washington.”                
                

            
                As Utah goes, so goes the nation?

"Rep. Black: ObamaCare has failed you, America. We’re going to stop the bleeding and get you something that works","Now Playing                            GOP senators roll out ObamaCare replacement bill                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                As the 115th Congress begins, I am honored to assume a new role as Interim Chair of the House Budget Committee.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is an exciting opportunity, particularly as the first woman to fill the position, but more than any title before my name, I’m still most proud of the two letters that follow: “R.N.”                
                

            
                I graduated from nursing school in 1971 and still keep my license today. Those years on the front lines of patient care, primarily in emergency room settings, inform much of the work I do in Congress – especially when it comes to ObamaCare.                
                

            
                It’s no secret that Congressional Republicans aren’t keen on former President Obama’s health care law (of course, recent polling shows that a majority of Americans still aren’t either) but, for me, the debate has never been about politics. It’s personal.                
                

            
                As a nurse, I saw the impact of health care decisions in Washington play out every day on my patients’ faces and in their billing statements.                
                

            
                I understand the need for healthcare reform as well as anyone, but ObamaCare wasn’t the way to do it – and nowhere is that more deeply felt than in my home state of Tennessee.                
                

            
                In 2013, 28,000 Tennesseans lost their insurance coverage in a single day when a state program called “CoverTN” lapsed after the Obama administration decreed that it ran afoul of the health care law’s top-down requirements.                
                

            
                Two years later, our state’s ObamaCare co-op would follow suit, leaving thousands in a scramble for coverage.                
                

            
                Today, Tennesseans are seeing an average 63 percent premium spike and 73 of our 95 counties have a single option to choose from on the Obamacare exchange.                
                

            
                Our state insurance commissioner didn’t mince words last year when she described the marketplace as “very near collapse” but even that characterization is generous. When three-fourths of your state lacks any choice among insurers, it’s no longer a marketplace at all – it’s a monopoly.                
                

            
                Sadly, Tennessee has seen this movie before, and we know exactly how it ends. A similar government-run program, called TennCare, failed in our state less than 15 years ago.                
                

            
                First enacted in 1994, this program dramatically expanded Medicaid eligibility to just about anyone that wanted it, including healthy, insurable adults who simply lacked employer-sponsored coverage.                
                

            
                Costs for TennCare quickly exploded, rising 146 percent over a ten-year window with little to show in the way of improved health outcomes.                
                

            
                In 2001, BlueCross Blue Shield, which covered half of all TennCare patients, threatened to pull out of the program because of massive losses and, by 2004, an independent audit revealed TennCare was on track to bankrupt Tennessee.                
                

            
                Like ObamaCare, TennCare couldn’t deliver on its promises. Both programs found themselves mired in court cases, unable to attract healthy adults, struggling to keep insurers, crippled by a lack of proper verification for eligibility, and ultimately failing to bend the health care cost curve.                
                

            
                It was ultimately a Democrat Governor, Phil Bredesen, who scaled back TennCare to a traditional Medicaid model, admitting “Our experience with trying to do universal coverage ended up being a disaster.""                
                

            
                Now, Tennesseans are experiencing a bad case of déjà vu.                
                

            
                Following the clear mandate from American voters last fall – and keeping the lessons of TennCare in mind – Congressional Republicans recently took the first steps towards the repeal of ObamaCare.                
                

            
                The debate on the House floor over the legislation was spirited, with Democrats claiming that supporters of repeal are pulling the rug out from millions of Americans, but their argument falls short.                
                

            
                For every person that ObamaCare loyalists claim has been helped by this law, another has opted out of the law altogether. Indeed, between the number of people who claimed an exemption from ObamaCare penalties and those who paid the fines – some 20 million Americans are rejecting ObamaCare outright.                
                

            
                Washington types fail to understand that by repealing and replacing ObamaCare, we are not disrupting a system that is working, we are offering a rescue plan to stop the bleeding and transition away from a law that already failed by every measure. That also means offering a stable transition period, so that no one falls through the cracks, and then offering a path to something better.                
                

            
                If President Obama’s infamous pledge that “If you like your plan, you can keep it” was the greatest lie surrounding ObamaCare, then a close second is the claim that Republicans have no alternative.                
                

            
                For example, Speaker Paul Ryan filed the Patients Choice Act during the same session of Congress ObamaCare was passed. Unsurprisingly, the Democratic majority wouldn’t give the bill consideration.                
                

            
                More recently, my Tennessee colleague, Congressman Phil Roe, a physician by trade, offered the American Health Care Reform Act and Congressman Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon, introduced the Empowering Patients First Act.                
                

            
                While the exact details of these bills vary, they all center on solutions that expand choice, force insurers to compete for patients’ business, protect our most vulnerable, and work to drive down the cost of care.                
                

            
                Last summer, House Republicans put many of these solutions together in a detailed, 37-page policy blueprint called “A Better Way” for health care reform.                
                

            
                The House will legislate on an ObamaCare replacement bill that meets the contours of that plan this year.                
                

            
                Nearly seven years after ObamaCare became law on a party line vote, we can say with certainty that we’ve tried health care reform the Washington way and it didn’t work.                
                

            
                Now, it’s time to try a better way – with solutions that trust patients over politicians and that offer Americans the care they want without forcing them to buy into a product they don’t need.                
                

            
                This nurse is ready to roll up her sleeves and get to work.

The Nays Have It -- We Must Repeal Obama's Pro-Abortion Health Care Law,"Americans do not want to pay for abortions with their tax dollars. That message was consistent during the debate over health care reform -- polls showed an overwhelming majority of American citizens, whether pro-life or pro-abortion, opposed federal funding of abortion. No shades of gray. This was solid common ground.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Elected representatives in Congress, however, failed to listen, and passed a health care law that marked the largest expansion of abortion since Roe v. Wade. The public was forced to repeat itself.                
                

            
                Through the elections this November, Americans again spoke clearly about their distaste for funding abortion by repealing and replacing politicians who supported the pro-abortion law.                
                

            
                The message now is simple: repeal the anti-life law.                
                

            
                When then-Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, declared last March that Congress had to pass the health care bill so that we could “find out what is in it,” she claimed pro-life Americans had nothing to fear. The legal analysis from Americans United for Life’s constitutional attorneys showed otherwise. And since passage of the bill our findings have been proven true: the law permits taxpayer-funded abortion. Nor does the Executive Order provide a remedy.                
                

            
                Consider the following ways that abortion snakes its way throughout the new law.                
                

            
                Violating the principles of the Hyde Amendment, which proponents of reform claimed to honor, taxpayer dollars will be used by insurance plans that cover abortion when they participate in the state insurance exchanges that are set to begin in 2014. However, one need not wait until 2014 to see abortion-funding rear its ugly head.                
                

            
                In July, the Obama administration approved plans by three states – Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Mexico -- to use federal dollars directly for elective abortions in their “high-risk” pools. Only after pro-life groups cried foul, did the administration enact a rule against abortion funding through these pools.                
                

            
                Now, pro-abortion groups are loudly clamoring for this limited policy to be rescinded. And the Obama administration admitted its concession on high-risk pools is not precedent for keeping abortion out of other areas of the health care reform law.                
                

            
                And there’s plenty more.                
                

            
                When the amendment authored by Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Maryland) requiring all insurance plans (not just those participating in the exchanges) to cover “preventive care for women” was added to the health care reform bill, pro-life advocates issued a warning. This could be used as a back-door abortion mandate. The provision does not define “preventive care.” Instead, it left that definition to the discretion of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).                
                

            
                Tasked with making a recommendation to HRSA, a panel of medical experts from the Institute of Medicine met this month for the first time to discuss what constitutes “preventive care.” The list of groups invited to help “inform” the panel in making the decision is filled with abortion-advocacy groups and includes the nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood. These organizations have been actively lobbying for abortion-causing drugs such as so-called “emergency contraceptives” to be included in this mandate.                
                

            
                These are just a few examples. In taking up Pelosi’s challenge to “find out” where abortion is hidden in the health care law, we find another twist around every corner. Like a cancer that has metastasized, abortion funding is riddled throughout the health care law.                
                

            
                And life is threatened in other provisions of the health care law. Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER), for example, may be used to deny or ration essential care. The ill, the disabled, and the elderly will be particularly vulnerable.                
                

            
                In response to the passage of a pro-abortion health care bill, Americans United for Life Action launched the “Life Counts” campaign. The campaign targeted eleven Congressmen, most self-identified as “pro-life,” who voted for the pro-abortion bill and a pro-abortion candidate for an open seat. Eleven of the 12 were defeated by their pro-life challenger.                
                

            
                Of course, many Americans rallied to oppose President Obama’s health care reform. The Tea Party movement, credited with the massive rejection of tone-deaf incumbents, which in turn resulted in massive gains made by the Republican Party, is full of pro-life Americans.                
                

            
                Florida’s new Senator Marco Rubio said it well: that the reaction by voters was not an embrace of the Republican Party, but an embrace of what the Party promised to be. And the party is, on the record, pro-life. Across the country and at all levels of government, the response by the American people to the pro-life promise was overwhelming.                
                

            
                Despite all the obfuscation and denials, it’s clear that President Obama fulfilled his promise. During his campaign in 2007, he promised his allies at Planned Parenthood that abortion would be “at the center, the heart” of any health care reform that he signed into law.                
                

            
                And it is.                
                

            
                Rotten at its core, this pro-abortion health care law must be repealed quickly before its anti-life agenda takes root.

5 Reasons Why Repealing Obamacare Will Not Increase the Deficit,"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Thursday released an estimate of the House Republican bill to fully repeal Obamacare. It found that doing so would increase the deficit by $230 billion.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This latest uncertain estimate should be taken with a trillion grains of salt, and Republicans would be foolish to place too much faith in it, for five reasons.                
                

            
                1. It reminds us of what we already knew. The health care law is full of budget gimmicks, and even if CBO is right about its fiscal impact, we can’t afford it because Uncle Sam is broke.                
                

            
                2. Nothing meaningful has changed. The Thursday estimate, shifting the budget window from 2010-19 to 2012-21, finds a 10-year savings of $230 billion, compared to $143 billion in the estimate from last March.                 
                

            
                We can compare apples to apples by looking only look at the 2010-19 period in both estimates. Doing so, we see the new savings figure is almost identical to the old one: $145 billion, compared to $143 billion.                
                

            
                3. The numbers are quite soft. Budget numbers swing up and down all the time. For example, just between March and August of 2010, CBO's baseline deficit projection for the year 2016 grew by $64 billion and its 10-year (2010-2019) deficit projection grew by $193 billion. That’s a lot of play in the joints. A similar swing in the next few months would swamp this current “official” estimate.                
                

            
                4. CBO has warned us not to over-rely on its numbers for Obamacare. Back in March, the agency was extremely tentative in its prediction that passing Obamacare would produce any savings, and refused to make any specific prediction beyond the law’s first decade. In today’s estimate, CBO says, “The projections of the bill’s budgetary impact are quite uncertain"" and ""have a roughly equal chance of turning out to be too high or too low.""                
                

            
                If just one of CBO’s many rosy assumptions is wrong, the bill won’t save a dime. To take just two examples:
• Medicare’s own independent actuaries have publicly warned that Obamacare’s unrealistic ""productivity"" cuts to hospitals are very unlikely to happen. Those cuts are projected to “save” $233 billion, while the repeal bill allegedly “costs” $230 billion. Upshot: If the Medicare experts are right on just that one point, repealing Obamacare will have no cost whatsoever.                
                

            
                • CBO assumes only 19 million workers will be dumped by their employers into the government exchanges in 2019, when there will be 111 million workers in the pool of potential “dumpees.” Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former CBO director, thinks that’s way too optimistic. He predicts 35 million workers will be dumped. If so, it would add another trillion dollars to the law’s costs.                
                

            
                5. History shows health care bills invariably cost more than the official estimates at the time of enactment — usually a lot more. Some famous examples:                
                

            
                • Britain's National Health Service cost 38 percent more than projected in its first year.                
                

            
                • Romneycare in Massachusetts cost 20 percent more than projected in its first full year.                
                

            
                • Medicare's kidney dialysis program, created in 1972, cost 2.3 times as much as projected in its first year.                
                

            
                • In 1965, Medicare was projected to cost $12 billion by 1990. Its actual 1990 cost: $110 billion — roughly nine times the original estimate. (The comparable figures for Medicare’s first decade, 1966-75, are: $2 billion and $14.8 billion, respectively — seven times the original estimate.)                
                

            
                (Source: Joint Economic Committee, Republican Staff, ""Are Health Care Reform Cost Estimates Reliable?"" July 31, 2009.)                
                

            
                Now, for fun, what if we applied that first-10-year Medicare error ratio of roughly 700 percent to Obamacare?                
                

            
                If we did, we’d have a first-10-year cost of not $1.3 trillion but $9.1 trillion. Ah, you say, 700 percent seems outlandishly high (even though that’s what actually happened with Medicare). OK, fine, let’s assume the program will only cost twice the official estimate (200 percent). That would be a cost of $2.6 trillion, or an over-run of $1.3 trillion. Still seem too high? How about a 50-percent over-run ($1.95 trillion, $650 billion over budget). Still too high?                
                

            
                OK, how about a mere 10-percent cost over-run. In that case, the law will cost $1.43 trillion, or “only” $130 billion “over budget.”                
                

            
                That, of course, would eliminate almost all of CBO's $145 billion in estimated savings.                
                

            
                In the light of this history, and math, does 10 percent seem like an unreasonable cost over-run percentage for a massive new government health care program?                
                

            
                Does anybody really believe Obamacare cost estimates will turn out to have been too high?                
                

            
                Don’t be scared, Republicans. History’s on your side on this one.

ONE YEAR LATER: Journalists' Love for Obama Still Going Strong,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                It's been a year since the American public first said ""I do"" to Barack Obama and it's still a honeymoon period for the mainstream press. The first year of marriage might have been a bit rocky, but journalists still have that crush on Obama.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The first time they ever really saw him speak, their hearts leapt. It was love at first sight. The media already had a betrothed who had promised them ""Hillarycare"" and taught them ""It Takes a Village."" That all changed when Obama gave the keynote address to the Democratic National Convention in 2004. At ABC, Charles Gibson predicted: ""Last night, a political star may have been born.""                
                

            
                In early 2007, as his presidential campaign wore on, more and more media types turned their back on their former love Hillary. They embraced Obama -- none more than MSNBC's Chris Matthews, whose ""thrill going up my leg"" became a permanent state of excitement for both him and his network.                
                

            
                Journalists were looking for a relationship -- ""Single journalists ISO return to Camelot coupled with PC racial sensitivity."" They spoke lovingly of his boundless optimism and gave a huge boost to his campaign. As the election neared, the media treated it like a coronation or an ascension. ""People have called you 'the savior,' 'the messiah,' 'the messenger of change,'"" said NBC's Matt Lauer to Obama just two weeks before the nation voted.                
                

            
                On Nov. 4, the wedding ceremony commenced. Like most spouses, the media promised to love Obama ""for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health."" Those two became major themes for the blossoming relationship. Soon after Obama was elected, the mainstream media began promoting his stimulus plan.                
                

            
                Journalists hid the biggest issues of the $787 billion package -- how to pay for it. Less than 2 percent of the network stories showed viewers the money and they relied on stimulus supporters more than twice as often as anyone who had questions. NBC reporter Scott Cohn said that for one struggling Indiana community, the stimulus ""could be a matter of survival.""                
                

            
                This wasn't just an economic relationship. Journalists had a schoolgirl crush -- eager to see their man playing basketball, talking to the press or vacationing. ""Fit to serve: Barack Obama photographed shirtless in Hawaii and a lot of women are giving him the presidential seal of approval,"" gasped NBC's Matt Lauer at the beginning of the ""Today"" show Dec. 23.
Then came the inaugural events -- filled with lefty Hollywood stars mingling with their East Coast political allies. Millions flocked to D.C., urged on by a media eager to see others stand by their man. ABC'S Bill Weir captured the event as no other, claiming ""never have so many people shivered so long with such joy."" That wasn't enough. Weir looked heavenward for hyperbole to bolster the ""World News"" faithful. ""From above, even the seagulls must have been awed by the blanket of humanity.""                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Their prince had come and journalists showered him with praise. Nowhere was the love been stronger than in Time magazine, which has featured the president's photo on 20 covers -- seven of those since his election. He's been husband Obama, Dr. Obama and FDR Obama. So far, superhero Obama was saved for comic books, where the president actually appeared with an adoring Spiderman.                
                

            
                But a few fractures appeared in the relationship. Protesters held tea parties bashing the crazed spending of the new president and even though the media gave them little attention, the word got out. Even a few liberal media types like CNBC's Jim Cramer complained that hope and change were hurting the economy.                
                

            
                The Obama administration lashed out, making it plain that it demanded unconditional love. The White House heaped particular abuse on the few in the media who just weren't that into him -- Fox News and conservatives like Rush Limbaugh.                
                

            
                With stimulus done, Obama tried to ram through health care reform but met new opposition during congressional town hall meetings. The media sided with him again. Network reporters took their cue from the president and exaggerated the number of uninsured to 46-47 million. Then they lowered it when he did. News stories followed a predictable script -- emphasizing reform supporters and ignoring costs. In one memorable love fest, ABC turned over its network to Obama for a ""serious conversation."" Viewers got more of a monologue, with 60 percent of the show controlled by the president.                
                

            
                By the end of a year, the relationship became one sided. The White House, like a nagging shrew, began picking at the flaws it saw in the press. The Associated Press and others were lambasted for criticizing Obama as talk of an ""enemies list"" filled the news.                
                

            
                Now comes their first anniversary. Somewhere along the way the bride who had the hope chest filled with ""change"" became the bride of Frankenstein. The media still love him and sing his praises. They just don't recite ""Barack Hussein Obama"" like some New Jersey school kids. This anniversary, the ""Wedding Song"" has been replaced by Taylor Swift's ""You Belong with Me.""

                Last week at a conference on the new health care law I got a big surprise.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                While Washington politicians are in a never-ending fight over President Obama’s health care reform many of the nation’s top insurance companies, brokers and major employers have long ago moved beyond the bitter debate in Washington. Even more than other Americans, they can’t understand a government shut down over the plan.                
                

            
                Unlike Americans who tell pollsters they don’t like the new law and find it confusing, the business professionals dealing with the day-to-day reality of the new health insurance landscape accept the Affordable Care Act as straight forward approach to begin cutting the rising cost of health care for people and companies.

                At the conference, sponsored by the Sun Life Financial Inc., these health care and corporate professionals pointed to reductions in the expense health care puts on small businesses with less than 50 workers. And they think people who work for small companies – as well as part time workers-- will get a better deal from public marketplaces for insurance than from most existing employer plans for part-timers.

                The business leaders are thinking about how the new law allows employees at big companies more freedom to decide what they want covered by the money provided to employees for health care.                 
                

            
                They are looking forward to employers being freed to focus on employee retention and motivation beyond health care plans.                
                

            
                And despite all the energy Republicans have dedicated to fight health care reform one of the nation’s leading health care economists Jonathan Gruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said about 80 percent of Americans are going to feel no change at all from ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Gruber helped to design the health care reform in Massachusetts under Republican Mitt Romney and advised the Obama administration on its plan.                 
                

            
                He estimates 17 percent of Americans will be demonstrably “better off” with lower cost insurance and better benefits while about three percent will face higher premiums and be “worse off.”                
                

            
                The recent demands from Republicans in Washington for a one-year delay in starting the government plan also struck the health care experts as damaging to companies and individuals. They see it as a cynical, political effort to sabotage the Affordable Care Act under the guise of “fairness.”                
                

            
                Professor Gruber, the keynote speaker at the forum, has previously estimated that the one-year delay of the individual mandate for all Americans to buy insurance would result in 24 million more Americans being uninsured.                 
                

            
                He calculated that the average health insurance premiums for Americans would rise 27 percent because of a delay.                  
                

            
                Gruber’s numbers have support from an updated study by the Center for Budget Policy and Priorities. It similarly concluded that a one year delay would result in millions more Americans being uninsured and higher health insurance premiums.                
                

            
                “The delay would adversely affect millions of Americans,” the Center reported. “The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that such a delay would cause 11 million more Americans to remain uninsured in 2014 and result in higher premiums for many others. It also would disrupt the new health insurance exchanges just as the open enrollment season is about to begin.”                
                

            
                “Specifically, a one-year delay of the individual mandate would reduce the expected coverage gains under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by nearly 85 percent, relative to current law, according to a recent CBO estimate. Delaying the individual mandate also would raise premiums for health insurance purchased in the individual market in 2014, CBO finds.”                
                

            
                What the experts are saying is that the proposed delay is really an effort to guarantee that the law will not work.                 
                

            
                At the end of the one year it would allow critics to say “see, we told you so.” This would be like an arsonist complaining that a building was too flammable and personally setting it on fire to prove his point.                
                

            
                New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said that each of us is entitled to our own opinions but not to our own facts.                
                

            
                If Republicans and conservative commentators are going to condemn the individual mandate they are going to have to deal with the business leaders who pay for health insurance, the brokers who sell the insurance and the experts who study it.                
                

            
                And their facts add to the high disapproval rates House Republicans are getting in polls for shutting down the government over the new health care law. And guess what? Those poll numbers are even worse than ObamaCare’s numbers.

When Is Team Obama Going to Take Responsibility for the Sorry State of Our Economy?,"After serving as the White House press secretary and as a spokesperson for years before that, I learned what it feels like to dread bad headlines.

It used to be you’d wait until the paper was thrown on the stoop and you’d run down the stairs holding your breath to see what it said. Now you just click online after 10 p.m. and that determines the kind of sleep you’ll get that night.

Headlines are often sharp and cutting while the articles themselves are more nuanced, and when read in full aren’t as bad as you first thought. But as reporters love to say, “I don’t write the headlines.”

Today, Democrats (and especially the White House) are reeling from bad headlines about our economic condition. Headlines this week included doom and gloom about the stock market, the housing market, the economic growth revision downward and the dismal job market. Specific examples include The Wall Street Journal’s, “Economic Outlook Darkens;” CNBC’s “Horror for the U.S. Economy as Data Falls Off Cliff” and the Washington Post’s “As Recovery Loses Steam, Few Remedies Left.”

One bad headline is a headache, two is a concern, but three sets off the alarm bells. Once the narrative takes hold, it’s hard to reshape it.

As this storyline has really started to sink in, some very experienced political analysts have described Rep. Paul Ryan’s “Roadmap for America” as being too big and bitter a pill for the American people to swallow. Some have even suggested Ryan has done a disservice to his party by proposing it.

Far be it from me to question the judgment of these analysts, but I think it’s worth breaking down their assessments of Ryan’s proposal before claiming he’s trying to sink the ship.

While some say he didn’t lay enough groundwork to sell his proposal to Congress or the public, others have said that his proposal is going to hurt the momentum the GOP built with the 2010 midterm elections, potentially affecting House and Senate races in 2012.

Democrats also love to demagogue Ryan. Their behavior is based solely on his desire to reform a broken, out-of-control program -- aka Medicare – that they want to keep – regardless of costs, consequences or the truth. And the truth is that the entitlements they want to preserve can’t survive unless there arereforms made soon.

Sure, Ryan could have laid more groundwork, but it’s almost always the charge that more is needed with major policy efforts—President Bush faced the same challenge with his Social Security reform proposal. President Obama, too, dealt with the same problem when he passed health care reform without working for more Republican votes, which helped lead to Democrats losing anhistoric number of seats in 2010.

I believe that had Ryan been timid and not faced up to the reality of our situation—that these reforms, including Medicare, are absolutely necessary—it would have ultimately been worse for both Republicans and the conservative movement as it stands. Timidity is not what’s called for, nor would it have been rewarded.

In showing his willingness to take on a very tough issue, Ryan is also showing leadership in re-charting our nation’s economic course. As we saw with this week’s headlines, the White House has us heading in a very different direction—and it ain’t good.

That said, it’s not adequate to place all the blame on the president for the economic numbers as they are – but at this point, 2.5 years into Obama’s presidency, they own this economy fair and square. The economic policies the administration has advanced, first through a partisan Congress and then through the Executive Branch, have had consequences.

I remember in 2009 when Vice President Biden sung the praises of Obama’s recovery plan, welcoming Americans to the “Recovery Summer.” I thought at the time it wasn't good, because if the White House is willing to claim credit for the ups, it also needs to be willing to take the blame for the downs.

Which leads me to wonder: Who, really, is doing their party a disservice—the Republicans, or the Democrats?

Ryan’s budget is helping people accept reality—that cold, sinking feeling they’ve had about the economy, just like the one you get when you realize a relationship isn’t just in dangerous waters, but is about to run aground for good.

Without the White House accepting some responsibility for the state our nation’s ship is in and offering a course-correction, our economic future could hit the rocks.

The Eye-Popping Cost of Obamacare,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The House Democrats released their long-awaited draft health care reform bill today, and every rumor about what tax hikes would be included was true--and then some. My friend Ryan Ellis over at Americans for Tax Reform posted the details.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The big shocker is that the surtax on high-income earners, including small businesses, is much steeper than the rumored 3 percent that I talked about in my podcast yesterday. Instead it's 5.4 percent. Not of taxable income, mind you, but of adjusted gross income. That means the tax applies to income that was spent on home mortgage interest, medical expenses, property taxes, charitable contributions, and nearly everything else currently deducted from taxable income.                
                

            
                Combined with President Obama's plan to repeal the Bush tax cuts on schedule in 2011, this would mean hiking the top marginal capital gains tax rate from 15 percent to 25.4 percent--much higher than Obama promised on the campaign trail, and near the 28 percent rate from before the 1997 Bill Clinton tax cuts. Such a tax hike would slam the brakes on capital formation and wallop capital markets with another gut punch just as they are finally beginning to recover from the financial crisis. It would also dramatically inhibit badly needed business investment.                
                

            
                The tax hit on capital gains, however, would pale compared to the new top rate on ordinary income, already scheduled to go from 35% to 39.6 percent in 2011, but now pushed up to 45 percent with the new surtax, and actually substantially higher than that as a percentage of taxable income because the new 5.4 percent surtax is applied to AGI.                
                

            
                Such punitive income tax rates would be a huge impediment to business activity throughout the economy, especially for the small and medium-sized business that create nearly all of the new employment that we need to lead us out of the recession.                
                

            
                And it actually gets a lot worse. Employers would also be mandated to provide health insurance under the bill, and the cost of health insurance would likely skyrocket because of new regulations called guaranteed issue and community rating. The only alternative, which many companies would either be forced into by cost considerations or choose for simplicity, would be to pay a payroll tax of as much as 8 percent. That's on top of the existing 15.3 percent payroll tax for Social Security and Medicare, creating a new total payroll tax of 23.3 percent.                
                

            
                There would also be a new tax on individuals who don't have health insurance, flying in the face of President Obama's key primary campaign promise not to require people to be insured. That tax would be another 2.5 percent of AGI.                
                

            
                These eye-popping numbers, of course, don't include state and local taxes, which are also rising in most of the country.                
                

            
                The tax hikes in this bill represent the last piece of the puzzle--along with loose monetary policy and high government spending--to repeat the key economic blunders of the 1970s, with all the misery that came with them.

Emanuel vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania and an oncologist  who has advised the White House on health care reform, offers some interesting suggestions about to how to resuscitate a dying Healthcare.gov.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                If any of us were on the operating table, what skill-sets would we ask for to make sure that we survived?                 
                

            
                This is the same question everybody should be asking of what the A-Team should really look like to make sure that Healthcare.gov doesn’t die.-- After all it’s pretty clear that up until now the only people caring for this dying website may be some interns or residents in training.

                1. Understanding the nuts and bolts of complex health data.                
                

            
                Anybody who steps in to build a team to resuscitate Healthcare.gov needs to understand the complexities of enrollment systems, payroll systems and insurance systems to know how that data should ultimately be tied together.                  
                

            
                If the chief surgeon does not understand what he is going to find when he opens up Healthcare.gov, and what he needs to do about it, it doesn’t really matter about his ability to give orders because he will have no way of giving instructions to even the best technologists about where to look, and what to do, and what potential obstacles to look for.                  
                

            
                The key people in the industry who understand the complexities of these systems are few and far between, but they have all had some kind of management role in a large insurance company, health care data company or perhaps even a state-level exchange.                
                

            
                2. Understanding the complexities of health insurance, purchasing and pricing.                
                

            
                For decades employers, brokers and insurance companies have been struggling with a process called “open-enrollment” that typically happens every fall.                  
                

            
                No matter how many times a company goes through this process it is an absolute nightmare for a Director of Benefits in any large corporation.                  
                

            
                Why would anyone believe that bringing in individuals with no expertise or understanding of what is involved in this process could help build a website for millions of individuals to purchase insurance and make decisions?                  
                

            
                Anybody that joins the resuscitation team now should have experience in what consumers are looking for, and ensure that every possible output of the website is logical.                
                

            
                3. Understanding how to build a great customer experience.                
                

            
                There is no question that Silicon Valley has figured out how to create delightful customer experiences better than anyone. But health care is different.                  
                

            
                'Without understanding health care delivery and the nuances of the system, it is impossible to deliver customer satisfaction and also be able to measure it credibly without truly understanding the needs of the individual who trying to buy insurance.                  
                

            
                The biggest mistake is to stack the deck with individuals who are trying to resuscitate Healthcare.gov who know nothing about health or care and only know about “gov.” We don’t need technicians; we need health care Super Stars to fix the problem.                
                

            
                4. Understanding how to communicate.                
                

            
                The biggest challenge for the Obama administration has been anticipation and communication. A key part of the A-Team needs to be individuals who credibly understand the problems and is able to communicate to the public about what to anticipate that people will believe.                  
                

            
                Imagine if you were in the waiting room of a hospital expecting to get news about how the surgery of your family member is going. Who would you want to hear from -- the billing manager or the surgeon?                  
                

            
                A key flaw in the entire strategy has been establishing an effective communications platform that delivers reliable, concise, coherent information to people who don’t even understand what health insurance is and are looking for help.                
                

            
                5. Understanding how to measure results.                
                

            
                A major gap in the rollout is the gaping black hole of how many people have actually enrolled and purchased an insurance plan.                  
                

            
                It’s a simple question.                  
                

            
                Yet, all of the focus has been on building a really slick website, but it appears that little attention has been given to reporting results.                   
                

            
                The only way we will ever know if the Affordable Care Act is really improving access, reducing costs and enhancing quality is if we have the expertise to know how to collect, analyze and communicate that information.                 
                

            
                A key member of the team needs to be somebody from a senior leadership role who has worked with various stakeholders in the healthcare industry, who has analyzed health care data, and who knows what it means to help create a framework for communicating results, irrespective of whether they are good or bad.                
                

            
                As the ObamaCare team scrambles to respond to the Code Blue, and if people without these key skill sets are not part of the crew, then the prognosis for Healahcare.gov, or any part of the Affordable Care Act, is bleak.

Why Obama Is a Lame Duck,"Just seven months into his term -- and 14 months before the 2010 midterm election -- and could it be, is President Obama already a lame duck?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                With his passive management style -- which inevitably led to overreaching and heavy-handedness by Congressional Democrats  Obama has made himself largely irrelevant on many of the issues he ran on, from health care ""reform"" to ""resetting"" our foreign relations. Here are seven signs that Obama's political suasion is waning:                  
                

            
                                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                1. On the heels of Obama's tacit DNR on the end-of-life death panels in the Senate Finance Committee's health care ""reform"" proposal, the administration signaled that it is also willing to bury what has always been a key element of the president's plans for healthcare ""reform""(watch this video) -- a government financed ""public option"" to compete with (and eventually drive out of business) private health insurers. Bowing to opposition from Republicans in both houses of Congress, and fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats in the House, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the administration's fall-back position would be to support creation of consumer-owned nonprofit health insurance cooperatives. But the compromise is anathema to House Dems and Obama's liberal base, who vowed to fight to the bitter end for the public option. Either way, it's a damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't situation for Obama (and we saw Sebelieus backtrack on Tuesday) and demonstrates how completely he has lost control of the health care debate.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                2. After repeatedly insisting on getting a bill on his desk before Congress recessed for the summer, President Obama thought he had a deal with Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) that if the ""Gang of Six"" -- three Democrats and three Republican senators on the Finance Committee -- can't reach a consensus on a bipartisan bill by September 15 then the effort will be scrapped and Dems will push forward with their partisan proposals. But then Gang of Six member Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) told ""FOX News Sunday's"" Chris Wallace that he and the others will not be ""held hostage"" by the mid-September deadline, and that he and his five colleagues ""rejected"" a specific timetable, because ""it's more important to get this right.""In a warning to Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, he added, ""What we have agreed to is that we are going to be ready when we're ready.""                
                

            
                
3. A recipient of $45 billion in taxpayer assistance -- with the government holding a 34 percent ownership interest -- Citibank is required to submit the pay packages for its 25 senior executives and highest-paid employees to Kenneth Feinberg, the Obama administration's special compensation master (AKA ""pay czar"") for review. The New York Times reports that Citi plans to pay two of its traders a combined $128 million under contracts that had been signed before Congress passed a law tasking the Treasury Secretary with examining compensation packages of top executives at companies that received funds from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) -- even after being warned by Treasury officials that the contracts would be rejected:                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Now the bank's decision presents the administration with an awkward political choice between doing little or doing nothing about the contract.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Treasury officials could issue a nonbinding advisory opinion critical of the pay package that that would carry no legal weight but could ameliorate some of the expected political fallout. Or it could do nothing and face the wrath of the public and Congress, which will consider legislation to limit executive pay after its August recess.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Feinberg himself is unsure of whether he has the legal authority to make Citi toe the line. Speaking in generalities, he told Reuters that his authority over executive compensation is ""binding"" and can ""claw back"" money already paid out, but regarding the specific case of the two Citi traders -- one of which stands to earn $98 million this year -- he admitted that he is unsure at this juncture ""[w]hether I have jurisdiction to decide his compensation or not""and that he has ""limited power"" over contracts signed before February 11, 2009.""                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                So if Citi thumbs its nose at Tiny Tim Geithner and Feinberg, there may be little or nothing the Obama administration can do about it.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                4. If enacted, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warns that the House's ""cap-and-trade""climate change bill would cost $8 billion over a 10-year period to implement, and would require thousands of new bureaucrats to formulate nearly 1,500 regulations and mandates for at 21 federal agencies, reports The Washington Times.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Now, four Democratic Senators -- Blanche Lincoln (Ark.), Ben Nelson (Neb.) and Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan (both representing North Dakota)  want to scale down the upper chamber's climate-change bill, reports Bloomberg.com:                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                The resistance by Lincoln and her Senate colleagues undercuts President Barack Obama's effort to win passage of legislation that would cap carbon dioxide emissions and establish a market for trading pollution allowances, said Peter Molinaro, the head of government affairs for Midland, Michigan- based Dow Chemical Co., which supports the measure.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Leaders of the Democratic-controlled Senate say they are sticking with their plan to combine a version of that bill with a separate measure mandating energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources such as solar and wind power. The legislation also provides for an extension of offshore oil and gas drilling in certain areas, broadening its support.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Reid needs 60 votes to pass a bill that includes a cap-and-trade measure in the Senate, and 15 Dems have already joined their Repub colleagues in opposition because of concerns on the effects of the legislation on the economy.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                5. Leaving aside Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez's continual disrespect towards Obama ""calling him an ""ignoramus""and saying he is ""lost in the Andromeda Nebula"" -- The Christian Science Monitor notes that ""President Obama may be willing to talk to America's adversaries abroad, but six months into his tenure hardly anyone is returning his call""and that ""[w]hether the issue is key security threats, as with Iran and North Korea, or lower-profile matters, as with Cuba or Burma (Myanmar), Obama's critics and even some backers of the ""talk to the enemy' approach are starting to speak of the policy's limits:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                As Americans went to the polls last year, they were apparently ready to give Obama's approach a try, after the perceived failures of the Bush administration's practice of freezing out enemy states. As president, Obama wasted no time converting a campaign pledge to official policy, declaring in his inaugural address, ""We will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.""                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                More than six months later, Obama can claim no breakthroughs or cite any obvious unclenched fists. Of the cases where the policy faces its biggest test -- Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba -- responses to Obama's outstretched hand range from a bite back on the nuclear front (North Korea) to silence (Iran) to modest movement (Syria and Cuba).                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                [C]ritics say the months since the extended hand of the inauguration have allowed adversaries time to further their own goals.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                6. Here at home, Obama's grass-roots network -- the 13 million member-strong Organizing for America -- is not exactly champing at the bit to have a go at opponents of his health care objectives, reports The New York Times:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                More than a dozen campaign volunteers, precinct captains and team leaders from all corners of Iowa, who dedicated a large share of their time in 2007 and 2008 to Mr. Obama, said ...""they supported the president completely but were taking a break from politics and were not active members of Organizing for America.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Some said they were reluctant to talk to their neighbors about something personal and complicated like health care. ...                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                But even among those who turned out for the meetings, many of whom had Obama buttons affixed to their shirts and spoke glowingly of the president, there was a sense of fatigue at the prospect of returning to the political calisthenics the Obama army once required.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                To Jim Pinkerton, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and a FOX News contributor, the lack of enthusiasm is quite illuminating -- ""a tale of not only political enervation, but also an epic tale of policy defeat."" In a post published on the Serious Medicine Strategy blog, Pinkerton writes:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                ""Taking a break from politics""? Excuse me, but that's not how political activists operate. They get into politics because they like a campaign, or, if one prefers, a crusade. And they get out when they don't have such an energizing effort to throw themselves into -- or when their eager hearts are broken. And yet that's what Obama has given Democratic activists -- a heartbreaking, de-energizing argument. ...                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                But of course, we are out of money for health care because Obama chose to spend that money on other priorities -- Tim Geithner's friends. ... Given a choice between investment bankers and non-masters-of-the-universe, Obama and his investment-banker-ish advisers chose ... investment bankers. Maybe Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan can make those grassrootsy phone calls in Iowa.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                What Americans get all fired up about, Pinkerton rightly observes, is fighting for their own health, not for ""health insurance reform.""                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                7. A new Gallup Poll, ""Political Ideology By State, January 2 -- June 30, 2009,"" finds that ""a significantly higher percentage of Americans in most states -- even some solidly Democratic ones -- call themselves conservative rather than liberal. Here's the breakdown: In all 50 states, more people call themselves ""conservative"" than ""liberal;""in 22 states, more people call themselves ""conservative"" than ""moderate; and in 10 states, the number of people who call themselves ""conservative""and ""moderate"" are tied or virtually tied. And remember, this poll was taken before the healthcare ""reform""issue ignited and moderates and independents started attending town hall meetings demanding to know how the government will pay for a massive, costly new entitlement.

On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said people have lost confidence in government:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                You know, this debate isn't about health care.  Health care's the symptom.  The debate is an uncontrolled federal government. ... [T]he tone is based on fear of loss of control of their own government. ... [W]e have raised the question of whether or not we're legitimately thinking about the American people and their long-term best interests.                  
                

            
                                 
                

            
                The Democrats control both houses of Congress and, as president, Obama is the head of the party so a loss in confidence in the government is, at least in part, a loss in confidence in his leadership of the government.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Columnist Victor Davis Hanson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, marvels, ""[w]e are witnessing one of the more rapid turnabouts in recent American political history:                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                President Obama's popularity has plummeted to 50 percent and lower in some polls, while the public expresses even less confidence in the Democratic-led Congress and the direction of the country at large. Yet, just eight months ago, liberals were talking in Rovian style about a new generation to come of progressive politics - and the end of both the Republican party and the legacy of Reaganism itself. Barack Obama was to be the new FDR and his radical agenda an even better New Deal.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Hanson attributes Obama's puffed-up popularity falling like a souffle  to 10 factors -- including voters being wary that the cures for global warming, illegal immigration, health care and other large, seemingly intractable problems are worse than the problems themselves --especially new direct and indirect taxes taking an even bigger bite out of the family budget; becoming outraged over the quadrupling of the national debt; finding Obama to be extremely partisan, polarizing and ""hyper-racially conscious"" and apprehension that Obamania is verging on something sinister and Orwellian.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                All of which may be setting Dems up for a comeuppance in November 2010. Byron York, chief political correspondent of The Washington Examiner, writes: ""It's a possibility many Republicans speak of only in whispers and Democrats are just now beginning to face. After passionate and contentious fights over health care, the environment, and taxes, could Democrats lose big -- really big -- in next year's elections? ... Not long ago, some Republicans were worried about becoming a permanent minority party. Although they may not win in 2010, they feel like they're back in the game.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                In either case, the 2010 election could put checks and balances on Pelosi and Obama -- which will make it even harder than it has proven thus far for the president to keep his campaign promises. And when he runs for re-election in 2012, disappointed, disillustioned and dispirited libs and young voters may not report for duty at Organizing for America, or flock to the polls as they did in 2008.

                The Democrats just don’t get it. The American people don’t want what they are selling no matter how it is packaged and spun.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                After all, what good is “affordable health care” if you don’t have a job to pay for it?                
                

            
                After his party suffered devastating electoral defeats in New Jersey, Virginia and Massachusetts, President Obama declared that his number one concern would be jobs and improving the health of the economy and reducing the deficit.                
                

            
                So, what is the president doing? Is he having a “jobs summit”? No, he is having a “health care summit.” The president just doesn’t get it.                
                

            
                The Democrats came to power convinced that they could do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted. They created a “crisis” on health care, when America faced an honest to goodness crisis on the economy, the worst since the Great Depression.                
                

            
                After coming to power and controlling all branches of government with high majorities, Democrats did what they wanted, instead of what America needed. They forced through a stimulus bill that no one in Congress even bothered to read, promising that if it were passed our national unemployment would not climb above 8 percent. Everyone knows the stimulus was an utter and complete failure. Unemployment nationally still hovers around 10% and in many urban areas it tops 16 percent.                
                

            
                But, despite an ailing economy, and political setback after political setback, Democrats just cannot let health care go. The president does not have the ability or the power to push back on the most liberal members of his party and as a result his party will suffer greatly come this November.                
                

            
                It should be noted that to date, it has NOT been Republicans who have prevented a health care reform plan from being passed; it is Democrats who have failed themselves.                
                

            
                Democrats are now talking about passing their health care bill using a parliamentary maneuver called “reconciliation.” Reconciliation is a Congressional legislative process that allows a difficult budgetary bill to pass without the possibility of a filibuster. Without the threat of filibuster the Democrats who already control both Houses of Congress with high majorities can effectively silence their own rouge Members and those of the minority.                
                

            
                Republicans need to show up at the president’s “health care summit” but they can’t be part of an effort aimed at “window dressing” and they also can't be wall flowers at the party either.                
                

            
                The leadership of the Republican Party in both the House and Senate should confront the president at his summit in a respectful and forceful way.                
                

            
                Here is what they should say:                
                

            
                Mr. President, we the members of the Republican Leadership of the House and Senate are here today out of respect for you and your office and to constructively engage on the many issues regarding meaningful health care reforms. We would have preferred to have been called together to discuss job creation, deficit reduction and national spending. You, Mr. President, have specifically stated that your number one priority needs to be on jobs and the health of the greater economy. We concur with your assessment. It is our hope that you will engage with Republicans in that regard sooner rather than later.                
                

            
                Mr. President before we begin our work, we would like to know if it is your intent to proceed with some form of a health care bill utilizing reconciliation?”                
                

            
                If the president refuses to rule out using reconciliation as a means to pass health care reform, the Republicans need to walk out of the meeting.                
                

            
                The American people want their government to be responsive to their needs and concerns. Right now their most immediate concern is being gainfully employed and having piece of mind that the greater economy is healthy and robust.                
                

            
                The Republicans job is not to make bad Democratic legislation better. Their job is to stop bad legislation from being passed and to offer alternative legislation and policy that is in keeping with what is of most concern to the people of the United States.                
                

            
                The Republican mantra needs to be job creation, deficit reduction, budget discipline, tax reduction and a strong national defense. If they stay true to those principles, they will be wildly successful. If they don’t, they won’t. Good governance is good politics. It is just that simple.

Why this doctor is glad that Trump wants to take on big pharma (and protect  Americans from drug makers' greed),"Now Playing                            Trump: You're going to be proud of plan to replace ObamaCare                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Health care reform has been a big part of the election of 2016.  While the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) has taken center stage, many have wondered what may happen to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under a Trump presidency.  Wednesday, President-elect Trump made the answer quite clear — no more price gouging.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In the last year, we have all heard about the significant price hikes of the Epi Pen made by Mylan pharmaceuticals. Mylan and CEO Heather Bresch are just one example of price gouging, price fixing and collusion among pharmaceutical companies.                 
                

            
                Many other drugs are also increasing in cost at alarming rates, without any real plausible explaination. Most concerning is the fact that while consumers have seen a 500 percent increase in the cost of the Epi Pen, Ms Bresch has seen a nearly 700 percent increase in her own salary over the last few years.                
                

            
                Mylan is definitely not alone in its greed. Last year the CEO of Turing, Martin Shkreli increased the price of an important (and relatively cheap) drug in the treatment of HIV related illness nearly 5000 percent.                
                

            
                Countless other cases of inflated drug prices have come to light in recent months.                 
                

            
                In Europe, a precedent has been set when in late 2016 drug maker Pfizer was fined a record 85 million pounds by the National Health Service for unfairly raising the price of an old epilepsy drug by 2,400 percent.                 
                

            
                It is clear that price gouging is not limited to newly developed or expensive biologic/designer drugs–even the price of insulin (which has been around for decades) has gone up nearly 300 percent.                
                

            
                Insulin and other medicines like it are drugs that are used to treat common diseases (like diabetes) that many patients NEED daily just in order to LIVE.                
                

            
                 Are we now going to allow some in the pharmaceutical industry to maximize their profits at the expense of the health of children with Type I diabetes?                 
                

            
                Wednesday, President-elect Trump took dead aim at the pharmaceutical industry in his noon press conference.  He made it clear that he will take steps to regulate the pharmaceutical industry because “they are getting away with murder”.                   
                

            
                Mr. Trump stated that he will seek to immediately allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices—no longer will government programs be forced to pay whatever pharmaceutical companies ask.                 
                

            
                He suggested that open bidding by suppliers to provide drugs for Medicare would be an important way to manage cost and potentially save billions of healthcare dollars.                 
                

            
                Mr. Trump noted that the pharmaceutical lobby has been a dominant force in Washington and has been instrumental in keeping prices high. It appears that the President-elect will take quick steps to address the growing national crisis of drug costs.                  
                

            
                Currently the U.S. pays far more for drugs than any other developed nation. We bear the costs of research and development for the rest of the world.  While it is critical to innovation that we reward new developments, we must create limits to how much (and for how long) drug makers can charge exorbitant prices.                 
                

            
                Its Time that We Hold Pharmaceutical Executives Accountable                
                

            
                As a physician and patient advocate, one of the biggest barriers to treatment in my practice is the cost of therapy.                 
                

            
                 Patients want to get well and want to do what is needed to stay healthy. However, many simply cannot afford to purchase their medications—even with assistance programs.                  
                

            
                Pharmaceutical companies MUST do better and I believe that  President Trump will work to make sure that they provide quality products at AFFORDABLE prices in the future.                 
                

            
                 Congress MUST look at amending patent protection laws and must also review the rules and regulations concerning the production and cost of generic medications.                  
                

            
                We must allow Americans to purchase drugs from reputable pharmacies from Canada and other locations in order to lower costs at home.                  
                

            
                Most importantly we must ensure that our government does not overpay for common, low cost drugs simply to line the pockets of pharmaceutical executives and shareholders.                 
                

            
                Initially following the election, drug stocks soared as investors anticipated less regulation and more free market competition in this space.                  
                

            
                Wednesday, things retreated immediately following his comments with the health sector already down several percentage points.  Mylan and Bristol Myers Squibb immediately dropped nearly 4 percent while others such as Pfizer and and Allergan dropped 3 percent.                  
                

            
                It  is my hope that leaders in the pharmaceutical world will begin to work with Mr. Trump and Congress to find better and most cost effective ways to lower the cost of needed and life saving prescription drugs.                 
                

            
                 It appears that with the signing of the 21st Century Cures Act in December, the process for getting drugs approved by the FDA will become much more streamlined and less costly—providing a cost reduction to the pharmaceutical and device industries that should be passed along to patients.                
                

            
                I believe that in his press conference Wednesday, President-elect Trump showed that he is going to stand up for patients and work to reduce the cost of health care in the U.S.                 
                

            
                While drug prices are just one aspect of a very complex system, I think that it is a great place to start.                  
                

            
                Finally, my patients may be able to afford their pills.

Time to Take a Page From Ross Perot's Playbook,"The Obama administration is on the right side when it comes to the issue of health care but their communications strategy is awful. If you thought the ""Harry and Louise"" ads brought down the Clinton health care plan this concerted effort by the Republicans makes those ads look like the proverbial day at the beach.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                One of the arguments that has been made is that President Obama let Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid design the health care reform bill rather than write his own bill as the Clinton administration did. The jury is still out about whether or not that has been the best strategy but it is clear that the Speaker and Harry Reid did not handle it well. The other argument is that by allowing Congress to take their traditional summer recess it has created a vacuum filled by protests and rancor.                 
                

            
                What if the bill had waited till September? What if Pelosi and Reid had kept Congress in session thorough the month of August until the bill was passed?                
                

            
                Perhaps the worst communications strategy has been to send the president all over the map for town halls and having numerous conference calls. President Obama is a GREAT communicator and can be serious, funny and down to earth at the same time. President Bush did town halls and he excelled at them but President Obama should overexpose himself and he should talk directly to the the American people. He needs to do what Ross Perot did so effectively in 1992.                
                

            
                Perot got 19% of the presidential vote against a sitting president (George H.W. Bush) and then-Governor Clinton. After several television interviews he decided to take control of his own message and bought thirty minutes of time on television networks. It was dubbed the first politcal television infomerical.                
                

            
                In a folksy style he faced the camera and using inexpensive cardboard charts he told the viewers his economic plan. On one segment he said he was going to use a voodoo stick as a pointer since we were in deep ""doo doo."" Even people who had no intention in voting for him watched what he had to say.                 
                

            
                If President Obama wants to change the argument and win support for his health care agenda he must do exactly what Ross Perot did. President Obama needs to ask for network television time (or buy it) and then lay out his proposal and tell the people why we can't wait anymore for health care reform.                
                

            
                He must answer the questions that people are most concerned about and he must do it in a folksy, down to earth style. He needs to answer what happens if we don't reform health care, how much it is going to cost if we do it, how much it is going to cost our country if we don't do it, how he plans on doing it and then address all the scare tactics from abortion to ""death panels"" to rationing. He can invite the Republicans to attack him and promise to be back in three weeks to answer their attacks. It is the ONLY strategy that will work and it can use the sheer force of his personality and communication ability. Let's hope he stops using surrogates, stops the town hall meetings and press conferences and just gives a Roosevelt like ""Fireside Chat"" by taking his case directly to the American people.

What Obama Doesn't Get About Americans and Health Care,"ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bending the cost curveÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ on health care is the hot wonk idea in Washington this year. Everybody in D.C. is talking about it: They want to flatten the upward angle, they say, of health care costs. Of course, as we all know, when they say ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“bending the cost curve,ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ they really mean rationing and imposing scarcity.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But what if the Beltway curve-benders are missing the point? Think about it this way... Let's agree that the true point of health care is healing. What if the real goal is not to bend curves down or flatten them, but rather to bend them up?                
                

            
                The curves we really want to bend--and bend upward--are health curves. Cost curves are important, and nobody wants them to go up unnecessarily but the curves that the American people really want to see bent--bent downward--are the curves of sickness and disease.   Bend those ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“disease curvesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ downward, and the American people, currently deeply skeptical of the whole political crew in Powertown, would rally in support.                
                

            
                WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve done disease-curve downward-bending before.  WeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve bent down the curves for tuberculosis, polio, AIDS, and many other diseases. Is anybody you know suffering from scurvy?Or rickets? Or whooping cough? No? Good-- mission accomplished.                 
                

            
                The curve of those diseases has been bent downward, they're gone from being huge killers and disablers to comparatively minor afflictions. Polio has virtually disappeared, tuberculosis is a minor problem for the public as a whole, and even AIDS deaths in the U.S. have fallen by more than two-thirds in the last fifteen years. We might pause to think more about AIDS: Just two decades ago, we were told that AIDS had the potential to be a mass plague in America and yet now, thanks mostly to massive scientific intervention, AIDS has been reduced to a chronic disease, which kills every year just a fraction of the number currently dying from diabetes.                 
                

            
                Every life lost is a tragedy, of course, and so thereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s much more to be done.  But the medical urgency of better health only underscores the moral necessity, as well as the political popularity, of bending death-and-disease curves, down to zero wherever possible.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                We Americans think that life is precious. And so we are willing to spend a lot to improve, lengthen, and enhance life. In addition, in the back of our minds, we understand that good health is good economics; healthy people make for more economic output and invention than do sick people. Moreover, if we invent good medicines and treatments here, in this country, we can sell them to the rest of the world, creating jobs and generating economic benefits. In addition, if we wanted to, we could give such medical goods away, for either humanitarian or foreign-policy strategy reasons. What I have called the Serious Medicine Strategy is the ultimate example of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“enlightened self-interest.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½                
                

            
                ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s this larger view of the moral and economic value of good health that seems to elude the current crop of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“expertsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ in Washington. They seem focused on the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“costÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ side of the ledger, while they mostly ignore the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“benefitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ side.   If one only focuses on the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“costÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ side, then it makes sense, for example, to chop away at health care spending--to bend those cost curves downward.   And if old people go untreated and die earlier?  Well, as in Great Britain (sample headine: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sentenced to death on the National Health ServiceÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½), thatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s cheaper isnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t it?  IsnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t rationing of health cheaper?                   
                

            
                And if young people get sick and die from preventable diseases?  Or if veterans cost an ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“inconvenientÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ amount of money in V.A. hospitals? Deaths in those categories are losses to both society and the economy--to say nothing of the families--but they could be, and are, seen as savings in the eyes of government bean-counters.   Seen only a short time-horizon, the scarcity model is cheaper.                 
                

            
                style="" font-size: 12.0pt; margin-bottom: .0001pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black; margin: 0in;"">In contrast to the number-crunchings of cost-obsessed bureaucrats, if one looks at the whole of life, including all the benefits of being alive, then one further sees that the benefits of a healthy, happy, and productive people far outweigh the costs.                 
                

            
                And by the way, someone should tell elected politicians, who are more sensitive to public opinion than the unelected bureaucrats who do the policy advising and agenda-setting: The folks out there will re-elect only the politicians who seem to be rooting for them to succeed at living long and happy lives.                 
                

            
                But in the meantime, at least until the next midterm election, both the political and policy elites are locked into their vision of curve-bending cost containment. Testifying before Congress in June, Christina Romer, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, declared, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“In discussing cost containment, I want to focus on slowing the rate of costs.  This is the so-called ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œcurve-bendingÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ that can last for decades.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½  And not to be outdone on curve-bending, Aetna Insurance has created a whole Web site, entitled ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“bending the cost curve.com.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½                  
                

            
                For the most part, political appointees, such as Romer, and insurance companies, such as Aetna, are careful to say that they want to see no loss in the quality of treatment. And if pressed about the prospect of future medical improvements-- which might lead to new cures, and a long-term reduction of costs, by making people healthier-- they would undoubtedly say, yes, they are for those kinds of improvements.   But such talk about medical improvements is strikingly absent from their testimonies and advertisements.  And why is that?  Because Romer, Aetna, and all the rest are cost reducers, not benefit increasers.                
                

            
                Indeed, sometimes Obamacare supporters tip their hand, showing that they worry about cost control--and little else.    A case in point is Ezra Klein, writing for The Washington Post, who clearly empathizes with the Obama agenda, never hesitating to offer helpful suggestions to his team.  On Sunday, he conceded that the problem faced by the would-be cost-curve-benders is that their ideas are ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“abstract, speculative and, at times, even unpopular.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½  Yes, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“unpopular.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½                
                

            
                ThatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s for sure.  People donÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t like scarcity and rationing.   And so there are times when Obamacare--predicated on cost-curve-bending, a.k.a. scarcity and rationing--is ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“unpopular.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Like now.  Today, 56 percent of Americans say that they are opposed to Obamacare and to the Democratic vision of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“curve-bending.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½                
                

            
                But then Klein, the staunch Obamacare guy, added a revealing sentence in his Post piece, as he mulled over what might worry the White House health care policy team:  ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“What if it finds that some brand-new and incredibly expensive treatments are wildly effective? That could raise spending.  [emphasis added]   Well, yes, a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“wildly effectiveÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ treatment could ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“raise spending.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½  But hereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a not-so-bold claim: People would love to learn about a great new treatment. The average American would cheer. But KleinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s choice of words reveals much about how Washington elites see the issue of medical innovation; such progress is to be dreaded, not heralded.                 
                

            
                Obviously, some curves are meant to be bent, with or without medical breakthroughs. Sometimes less is good. If one is overweight, one should eat less. If one smokes, one should stop. But the politics of nagging and nudging people about their health-styles are tricky, full of human-nature-based boomerangs and backlashes.  And as we have seen twice now, during ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ClintoncareÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ in 1993 and now Obamacare in 2009, the politics of cost-curve reduction are toxic.                
                

            
                But the elites are so in love with their rationing vision that they keep pushing their same cost-curve-reduction ideas.  Just last week, two blue chip outfits, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) and the Peterson-Pew Commission on Budget Reform (PPCBR), released a report calling for ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“a strengthened Medicare advisory panel tasked with recommending Medicare savings.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ In so advocating, CRFB and PPCBR are referring to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent agency created by Congress in 1997, to advise the federal government on Medicare issues.                
                

            
                ItÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s no secret that fans of the current MedPAC want to see it grow much stronger in its ability to control costs.  They hope that MedPAC could become as secretively powerful over health care as the Federal Reserve Board has been secretively powerful over monetary policy.  It is better, Obamacare advocates figure, to kick ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“toughÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ decisions over to an an un-elected group of obscure experts-- and such a plan would be good, of course, for the ongoing employment of the expert class.  Indeed, would-be Obama health czar Tom Daschle proposed a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“Federal Health BoardÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ last year in his book, ""Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis.""

                UPDATE: News out of Thailand on Thursday morning, September 24 tells of a huge possible breakthrough--a vaccine against AIDS. The vaccine effort, financed by the US government, appears to thwart transmission of the disease in Thai trials. If this finding bears out, it will be huge, knocking out a disease that has killed tens of millions. And that will be another example of cost-curve-breaking, as opposed to just a cost-curve-bending. We need more of those.                
                

            
                Did you like what you just read? Here's part 2 of this piece.                
                

            
                James P. Pinkerton is a FOX News contributor and the editor of Serious Medicine Strategy.org."
My Dog and Health Care,"Over the weekend, we rushed our dog Hamlet to an emergency clinic in Riverhead, New York, where the vets who saw him said he had suffered a ""G.I. episode"" -- an upset stomach -- caused by a ""dietary indiscretion."" (The precise source of the indiscretion is still unknown.)                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But within 48 hours, our four-year old cockapoo was treated at two New York hospitals -- the East End Veterinary Emergency and Specialty Center, in Riverhead, which admitted him at 3:30 am, and then at the Animal Medical Center, in Manhattan, which was fully staffed despite the holiday. At both centers, he was seen immediately by skilled, caring doctors, and in New York City, by a specialist. He did not have to wait for over two hours in a crowded emergency room as my husband did a week earlier after cutting his hand on a martini glass. The E.R. was overflowing that night with people who, because they had no insurance, could not possibly afford to get the kind of treatment that Hamlet was getting.                
                

            
                Yes, it was expensive. And sure, our dog is special. The son of Princess Fluffy and Ramblin' Rambo, Hamlet is finicky and has grown accustomed to getting his way. But shouldn't the 49 million Americans without insurance get medical care at least as decent as his?                
                

            
                Americans spend roughly twice per capita what citizens of other industrial countries spend on health care for fewer services and often inferior care. In 2000, the World Health Organization ranked the United States 37th in health care -- behind not only virtually all of Europe and Japan, but also Morocco, Chile, and Costa Rica. (Slovenia ranked 38th.) Yes, America leads in many medical fields and offers extraordinary care, especially to those who can afford it.
Yet health care costs now account for nearly a fifth of our gross domestic product, and will account for almost a third in a decade if they are not contained. Still our national debate about how to fix our health care system is as polarized as the rest of our political discourse. The right accuses Obama of wanting to form ""death panels"" and ""socialize"" our medical system while the left is divided, disorganized, and often unrealistic about the true cost of universal care.
The media routinely underplay the influence of America's medical super-sector-- our giant health insurance industry, which spent more than $1 billion lobbying over the past 9 years. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the ultra-liberal independent from Vermont, notes that in the past three decades, health insurance bureaucrats, seeking to boost profits by denying subscribers treatment we were promised, have increased 25 times faster than the number of physicians.
Yet President Obama expects his supporters to endorse a policy that even he has been unable to articulate. Fearing a repetition of the Clinton health care debacle, he asked Congress to design a plan. So a gang of six has been huddling -- senators from states whose population represent fewer than six percent of the nation, several of whom have received huge contributions from the insurance industry they are now ostensibly trying to regulate.                
                

            
                There is a saying in the Middle East: a camel is a horse designed by a committee. So far, American health care reform under President Obama is one sick camel.                
                

            
                Belatedly, the president is trying to assert some leadership. On Wednesday he will deliver a major speech on health care. But not all problems can be resolved by eloquence. He must tell us specifically what he has in mind, how he plans for pay for it and get it passed. And he should stop misleading us. Surely he must know that what press spokesman Robert Gibbs said Monday -- namely that an as yet ill-defined ""public option"" will ""not in any way"" affect the 160- 180 million Americans who get their insurance primarily through their employer -- is unlikely to be true. Real reform would mean that features of our entire health care system would have to change.                
                

            
                As physicians Arnold S. Relman and Marcia Angell recently wrote, without specifically mentioning the insurance industry, ""fee-for-service payment and an entrepreneurial, fragmented system heavily weighted in favor of specialists"" are the cause of unsustainable cost inflation.
We, as Americans, are also partly responsible. For as the CDC says, two thirds of us are overweight; one third of us are obese. Some of us still smoke. We don't walk enough, sleep enough, or eat the right food. Our insurance plans don't adequately reward those who do. And we don't make them do so because our political system is as broken as our health care.                
                

            
                I'm relieved that my dog Hamlet got such great and compassionate care this weekend. Now I just want the same for my husband, other family members, our friends, and the rest of my fellow two-legged Americans.

                Has the Tea Party movement become the final casualty of the 2012 elections?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Here are four signs that the end – or at least a diminished future --may be near for once powerful Tea Party phenomenon that lifted Republicans to a House majority in the 2010 mid-term elections.                
                

            
                The first and most significant sign took place last week.                
                

            
                Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) stripped four of the most outspoken Tea Party members of his caucus of key committee assignments. Representatives Justin Amash (R-Michigan) and Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) were booted off the House Budget Committee. Reps. Walter Jones (R-North Carolina) and David Schweikert (R-Arizona) were kicked off the House Financial Services Committee.                
                

            
                Speaking on the condition of anonymity, GOP leadership aides said they were removed for “not being team players” and they warned: “You want good things in Congress and to have a good career? Better play along nicely.” Two of the Tea Party’s most visible television messengers, Reps. Allen West of Florida and Joe Walsh of Illinois, also lost their re-election bids in November.                
                

            
                The second sign came in the Senate. Tea Party Kingmaker, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) surprised the political world by announcing that he will be resigning from the United States Senate to become the President of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. DeMint said there is “no question” that he can do more to advance the conservative movement as head of a think tank than as a United States Senator who can introduce, amend, block and vote on federal legislation.                
                

            
                And a third sign of the Tea Party’s lower standing came when the incoming chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Jerry Moran, vowed that his organization will become more involved in senatorial primaries to prevent the nomination of Tea Party candidates who are likely to lose in statewide elections. “I don’t think we have any choice but to work to do things better than what we did, based upon the lack of success that we had.” Moran said.                
                

            
                Moran is obviously referring to the failed campaigns of Tea Party candidates that cost the GOP control of the Senate. Those candidates, backed by DeMint, include Delaware’s Christine O’Donnell, Nevada’s Sharron Angle, Colorado’s Ken Buck, Missouri’s Todd Akin and Indiana’s Richard Mourdock.  Karl Rove, the GOP strategist, has said that he wants to reorient his America Crossroads organization to intervene in primaries because he was “sick and tired of spending money in races where the moderates and the conservatives had gone at each other and made victory impossible.”                
                

            
                And there is one final sign of the Tea Party’s trouble.                
                

            
                Dick Armey, the former Republican House Majority Leader announced his resignation as head of the influential Tea Party group, Freedomworks.                
                

            
                The group was instrumental in pulling together town hall protests against President Obama’s health care reform law in 2009. Politico reports that the organization paid Mr. Armey $8 million in a separation agreement after a disagreement over how who would receive the proceeds from a book deal earlier this year.                 
                

            
                Armey told Politico that “The concern was that the story the press would write was that the whole Tea Party movement was in a state of disarray. That was probably a fairly reality based concern to have, and we wanted the organization to survive and do well and the movement to survive and do well. So that was one of the reasons why we were concerned about me leaving before the election.”                  
                

            
                All of this comes at a time when the Tea Party’s popularity is extremely low. A CNN/ORC poll from last month found that 50 percent of Americans now view the Tea Party movement unfavorably compared to only 32 percent who view them favorably. Tea Party candidates lost 12 of 16 races on Election Day.                
                

            
                While I have been critical of many of the Tea Party’s tactics and its solutions to the problems facing our country, I have always maintained the movement was mostly made up of honest, well-meaning citizens who are rightly concerned about profligate government spending and the national debt.                
                

            
                One of the unfair charges that liberals and the mainstream media made against the Tea Party movement was that they were purely racial in their anger at Obama. It is true the group is overwhelmingly white, older group and some members stray into offensive racial rhetoric. But that is not true of the whole movement and I said so at the time.                
                

            
                The truth is the Tea Party is bigger than anger at this president. When I talk with Tea Party activists they also express strong disappointment with George W. Bush’s policies. They do not like the Bush team’s record-breaking deficits, its embrace of Congressional earmarks and passage of an enormous expansion of Medicare entitlements without funding it. These are the people who opposed the Bush plan for comprehensive immigration reform.                
                

            
                That brand of Conservative activism in national debate is a good thing.  But the already decentralized movement – Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity, Tea Party Express, and Tea Party Nation -- has become unsustainably fractured and exploited by charlatans and profiteers.                
                

            
                My friend, Bill Kristol, shares this concern and wrote about it in a recent essay for the Weekly Standard:                
                

            
                “Reading about some conservative organizations and Republican campaigns these days, one is reminded of Eric Hoffer’s remark, “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.”                 
                

            
                It may be that major parts of American conservatism have become such a racket that a kind of ‘re-founding’ of the movement as a cause is necessary.

Our Next President Cinches Nomination,"After five states hold primaries this week, President Barack Obama is all but certain to officially win the number of delegates needed to be the Democratic nominee for the 2012 presidential election --- an election he will most likely win.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                On camera and in print, Republican officials and strategists are boastful about GOP prospects to take the presidency. But behind the scenes, even the most publicly audacious Republicans are quite sanguine about their fall prospects. It’s partly about Mitt Romney. The Republican base had to hold its collective nose to support Romney and, even then, he only narrowly achieved front-runner status and remains outright detested by high margins of the party faithful.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                But frankly, even if Ronald Reagan himself were to rise from the grave --- and be allowed to run as a Republican within an increasingly, aggressively Right wing party --- there is little chance that Republicans would win back the White House this fall. Why? No doubt some of you reading this can’t manage to find a single thing likeable about President Obama or his leadership. You, however, are not the voters who decide general elections. And while you have already decided who to vote for, among independent and swing voters the election is literally just beginning. No debates yet. No ads. No chance for the President to present the facts of his Administration’s accomplishments and poke holes in the job-destroying record of Governor Romney.                
                

            
                What record, you scoff with the putrid taste of partisanship in your mouth? Suck on this:                
                

            
                ·Job Creation: When President Obama took office, the economy was losing over 700,000 jobs per month. Through March 2012, the President’s policies have added 4.1 million new private sector jobs. That’s 25 consecutive months of positive, private sector job growth.                
                

            
                ·Investing in American Manufacturing: Under President Obama, America has seen its first year-over-year manufacturing job growth since 1997. And notably, the President saved the American auto industry --- the engine and pride of American manufacturing and a move for which 1 million American workers are clearly grateful.                
                

            
                ·Health Care Reform: Under the President’s Affordable Care Act, 34 million Americans --- who were previously uninsured and making us all pay more when they used ER treatment for primary care --- will now have health insurance. The American people agreed that something had to be done about runaway costs and the lack of comprehensive coverage, and the President took the leadership not to make excuses or put up obstacles but do something about the problem.                
                

            
                ·Tax Cuts: President Obama cut taxes for 95% of American families. Meanwhile, most millionaires and billionaires pay lower taxes than average Americans. The President supports raising taxes on the very wealthy instead of cutting Medicare and public education --- a move that the majority of voters also support.                
                

            
                ·National Security: See, e.g., Osama bin Laden.                
                

            
                I could go on. An energy policy that doesn’t just give handouts to the wealthy dirty oil businesses of the past but invests in the energy --- and economy --- of the future. Standing up for equal pay for women and reproductive choice. Raising public school standards and doubling investments in scholarships. No one in the President’s camp is going to argue the economy is as strong as we’d all wish nor that the work of fixing our health care system or public schools is complete. Indeed, I’ve spent much of my energy criticizing the President for not doing more on these fronts --- taking even bolder leadership with less regard for the carping and moaning obstructionism of Republicans. But make no mistake about it, as our nation’s leader during the second-worst economic recession in history, President Obama has a very strong record to fight on. And, as the saying goes, he’s only just begun to fight.                
                

            
                Things might look better for Mitt Romney had he created more jobs than he killed in the pursuit of his personal fortune. Or had he stuck to a consistent set of principles instead of flip-flopping his way across the electoral landscape of his career. Or if he would stop talking about his friends who don’t just watch NASCAR races but own them. Or if, instead of falling woefully behind President Obama on personal likeability polls, Romney would take a page from the Tupac concert and fashion a more warm and friendly hologram of himself to hit the campaign trail.                
                

            
                Still, even if Mitt Romney could pull off the impossible and become a likeable candidate without a checkered personal and political history, he would still be running against a very strong opponent with a very strong record. Oh yeah, not to mention the incumbent. But Romney and the Republicans will keep pinning their hopes on a dream of a chance at victory, while President Obama hangs his hat on the very real and very impressive accomplishments of his leadership.

                President Obama is sick and tired of the way his health care initiative has been twisted and misrepresented. He is especially annoyed that anyone...anyone... would suggest that he wants to euthanize poor old Granny. The problem is there are a lot of people, including some of his supporters, who want to do just that. Consider this line from a recent op-ed in the New York Times: ""shouldn't we instantly cut some of the money spent on exorbitant intensive-care medicine for dying, elderly people and redirect it to pediatricians and obstetricians offering preventive care for children and mothers?""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Talk about a slippery slope! Richard Dooling, author of the above comment, points out that we spend a huge amount on ""yet another trip to the surgical suite on the slim-to-none chance that by-pass surgery, a thoracotomy, an endoscopy or kidney dialysis might get her off the ventilator and out of the hospital in time for her 88th birthday."" I wonder how old Mr. Dooling is. I also wonder how his granny might feel about not getting end-of-life care.                
                

            
                President Obama has made a complete hash of explaining the need for health care reform. He argues that we need legislation to control the growing cost of medical outlays, and also to provide insurance and care for another 40 million Americans. This is his problem -- those two goals do not mesh. Americans are not stupid -- they get this.                
                

            
                Obama needs to focus on the inefficient way in which our country provides care to the uninsured, and solve that problem. The whole dialog about how much medical expense this country can afford overall sets off alarm bells and is, in any case, irrelevant. It has become an article of faith for reformers that we spend too much. Some 17% of GDP is said to flow into health care, though interestingly there is but one source for that figure, and few details attached to it. It is, actually, a projection made by the National Health Statistics Group; the last firm number showed that 16.2% of GDP in 2007 went into medical products and services. Few realize that this all-important data point includes the cost of teenage boob jobs, of Viagra prescriptions, prescription sunglasses, Botox and extremely costly dental veneers. In other words, this 16% figure encompasses a whole lot of discretionary spending that is only remotely connected to our health.                
                

            
                Though ignorant of the underlying data, what everyone in this debate is absolutely sure of is that we spend too large a slice of our American pie on health care. We know this because the president and a million other folks have told us so, and because other countries spend less.
All this figure really tells us is that Americans are spoiled, and up until now we could afford to be. We want it all, we want slim bodies that can hold up to rigorous exercise and satisfying sex for at least 80 years, while we continue to look 50 years old. If your knee hurts -- get it replaced! If you don't like the jowls that showed up at your last birthday -- get them removed! If your sex life isn't all it should be -- take a pill! Teeth out of line? Get braces!                
                

            
                Just as some of these ""fixes"" may seem self-indulgent (or ridiculous) to those fighting tooth and nail to get a life-saving mastectomy, giving Granny every last shot at prolonging life may seem unnecessary -- but it may be simply how we Americans want to spend our money. Up until now, we have had the luxury of providing the best of care to those we love. The argument that most medical outlays are expended in the last year of life -- pointlessly -- is spurious; all that says is that the monies we have paid into medical insurance over our lifetimes earn a return which is paid out at the end. That's how it is supposed to work.                
                

            
                There is no doubt that medical outlays can be reduced through the introduction of new technologies and through better management. The same is true of all huge sectors of the economy, and especially those where the government plays a significant role. I don't know why the town hall protesters don't ask why government-sponsored programs like Medicare and Medicaid cost more than equivalent care from the private sector. A study by Jeffrey Anderson of the Pacific Research Institute notes that ""since 1970, Medicare and Medicaid's costs have risen one-third more, per patient, than the combined costs of all other health care in America -- the vast majority of which is purchased privately."" That alone seems to undermine the notion that more government oversight is the way to go.                
                

            
                I also don't know why Republicans have not bargained for some restraint on medical malpractice awards. Personal experience, and much data, confirms that doctors over-prescribe tests and procedures from fear of being sued. Why isn't Congress discussing this reality? Are Republicans as squarely in the pocket of the trial lawyers as Democrats are?                
                

            
                There are many roads to reducing our outlays on health care, but the surest dead end is to attempt to limit what we do for Granny. After all, people are living longer and longer, so that many folks in their 90s are active and productive. What might have seemed reasonable twenty years ago -- limiting joint replacements for octogenarians for example -- makes no sense today. Bottom line? Go fix health care, but hands off my Granny!

Health care and health insurance are not the same thing - the fundamental disconnect in health care reform,"Politicians from both sides of the aisle continue to show a troubling disconnect from basic principles in their approach to health care reform. Among their many debates about changing health care, the single most essential reform – reducing the cost of health care itself - is typically underemphasized or even entirely absent from the discussion.  Yet that is the fundamental avenue to broader access to care, lower insurance premiums, and ultimately better health.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                Instead, legislators continue to erroneously focus on increasing the percentage of people with health insurance. But the disregarded reality is that health insurance premiums are only a secondary manifestation of other factors, chiefly the cost of medical care and to a lesser extent the regulatory environment for insurance.
                
                


                
            
                In a misguided attempt to insure more people at all cost, the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) doles out over $1 trillion of tax revenues to subsidize premiums and adds numerous regulations and taxes, many of which counterproductively increase premiums.  At this point, there should be no need to debate the harmful impacts of this approach – insurance premiums skyrocket; insurers withdraw from the marketplace; and for those with coverage, doctor and hospital choices narrow dramatically.
                
                


                
            
                What is baffling is that today’s Republican-dominated House and Senate both continue to focus on making insurance “more affordable,” mainly through cash to consumers in refundable tax credits.  By ignoring the root problem, such policies artificially prop up insurance premiums for coverage that often minimizes out-of-pocket payment. This shields medical care providers from competing on price. While emerging GOP proposals rightfully strip back some of the ACA’s harmful regulations and taxes, far more emphasis is urgently needed on reducing medical care costs, the core cause underlying high insurance costs.
                
                


                
            
                It is also particularly disturbing that our own elected leaders ignore what we all should have already learned from those countries boasting about a fully insured population under socialized medicine. In those countries with government insurance for all, epitomized by the shameful NHS of the United Kingdom, their “insured” patients have far worse access to care for even the sickest patients. There are unconscionable delays for those needing urgent treatment for already diagnosed cancer (17% wait more than two months) and already recommended brain surgery (17% wait more than 18 weeks); delayed access to important medications; and factually worse outcomes from serious diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes compared to Americans pre-ObamaCare. Indeed, having insurance is not at all synonymous with having access to quality medical care.
                
                


                
            
                Lowering the cost of medical care itself, though, is fraught with peril. It must be achieved without harming patients. That means without jeopardizing quality, restricting access, or inhibiting critical innovation of American medical care that - based on peer-reviewed data throughout the leading medical journals (see, for example, reviews such as In Excellent Health ) - is the standard of excellence for the world.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                We first must create an environment where consumers care about prices and receive benefit from seeking value. But is it even realistic to suggest that people could shop for medical care and seek value, as Americans do for virtually every other good and service?
                
                


                
            
                Some medical care, including emergency care, obviously does not lend itself to price consideration. But emergency care represents only six percent of health care expenditures.
                
                


                
            
                Among privately insured adults under age 65, almost 60 percent of all health expenditures is for elective outpatient care; only 20 percent is spent on inpatient care and 21 percent on medications. Likewise, 60 percent of Medicaid money is spent for outpatient care. Even in the elderly, almost 40 percent of expenses are for outpatient care. Of the top one percent of spenders, the group responsible for more than 25 percent of all health spending at an average of $100,000 per person per year, a full 45 percent of care is also outpatient. Outpatient health care services dominate America’s health spending, and these are amenable to value-based decisions.
                
                


                
            
                To fully leverage consumer power on health care prices, consumers must have an expanded role in directly paying for their care. Higher deductible insurance plans (HDHPs) are vehicles to position patients as direct payers for a higher proportion of their medical care. These plans are most effective when combined with large health savings accounts. When people have a reason to shop for value - when they have growing savings to protect in HSAs - the cost of care comes down without harmful impact on health. When paired with HSAs, spending of those with HDHPs decreased at least 15% annually in a March 2015 study. More than one-third of the savings by enrollees in such coverage reflected value-based decision-making by consumers. Cheaper, limited mandate, high deductible coverage; markedly expanded HSAs; and targeted tax incentives to expand their use are key to reducing medical care prices.
                
                


                
            
                Leveraging the power of seniors, the biggest users of health care, is also important. The expected tripling of health expenses for a 65-year-old by 2030 projected by HealthView makes HSAs even more relevant, particularly since today’s seniors with their longer lifespan need to save money for decades, not years, of future health care.
                
                


                
            
                In addition, reforms must eliminate the artificial constraints on the supply of medical care. Although less publicized, almost two-thirds of the 2025 projected doctor shortage of 124,000 will be in specialists, not primary care. Medical school graduation numbers have stagnated for almost 40 years. Severe protectionist residency training program restrictions have been in place for decades. And archaic non-reciprocal licensing by states unnecessarily limits specialist patient care, especially as telemedicine proliferates. These anti-consumer practices need to be open to public scrutiny and abolished.
                
                


                
            
                Primary care specifically could be far less costly with immediate modernization. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants can provide the vast majority of routine primary care, including flu shots, blood pressure monitoring, and prescription renewals. In a 2011 review, 88 percent of visits to retail clinics involved relatively simple care, 30–40 percent cheaper than at physician offices and about 80 percent cheaper than at emergency departments.  These clinics can potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars per year with high patient satisfaction.  We need to simplify credentialing requirements for such clinics, and states should remove outmoded scope-of-practice limits on nurse practitioners and physician assistants.
                
                


                
            
                The primary goal of health reform should be to reduce the costs of medical care, not to increase the number of insurance holders.  Beyond regulatory reform and tax repeal, specific mechanisms to reduce the prices of health care without harming access, quality, or innovation have been proven effective, and they should be the focus of health care reform.  Everything else follows.

              On June 27, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, urging him and the other Republicans in the Senate to abandon their plans to replace ObamaCare with what Paul believes—and rightly so—is a model too similar to the one created by the Affordable Care Act. Among the specific provisions Paul cites are the Senate leadership’s plan to offer millions of Americans federal tax credits and provide insurance companies with $136 billion to prop up the health insurance marketplace.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While those and many of Paul’s other points are worthy of consideration, there is one part of Paul’s health care reform wish list that is particularly important and worthy of significant attention: his call for “association health plans.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As Paul explains in his letter, “While I appreciate the inclusion of Small Business Health Plans in the BCRA, I believe improvements could be made to expand upon this provision to allow for greater freedom for individuals and small businesses to pool together for the purpose of obtaining health insurance coverage.”
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Under the BCRA, self-employed people could participate in small business health insurance plans, but Paul wants “the language [to] be changed to allow any individual, including self-employed individuals, to form associations for the purpose of purchasing group health insurance.”
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            While those and many of Paul’s other points are worthy of consideration, there is one part of Paul’s health care reform wish list that is particularly important and worthy of significant attention: his call for “association health plans.”
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              This might sound like a relatively unimportant bit of policy minutiae for those of you who aren’t interested in health care reform, but it most certainly is not. This one, largely overlooked policy addition has the potential to radically transform the health care market for the better and solve many of the problems ObamaCare attempted, but failed, to address—as well as those problems ObamaCare created.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              One of the greatest challenges facing policymakers on the issue of health care is determining how to ensure all people, including people who have pre-existing conditions, can have access to high-quality, affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act attempted to solve this problem by dramatically restructuring the health insurance market, creating substantial government subsidies and imposing numerous costly mandates and pre-existing conditions requirements on health insurers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              “If the health insurance companies aren’t going to provide fair prices to people with pre-existing conditions, we’re going to make them,” the ObamaCare creators apparently thought. However, once you stop requiring people to have health insurance before they get sick, you cease to have a true insurance system.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Imagine for just a moment what the car insurance market would look like if uninsured drivers could smash into other people’s cars and property and then be able to call an insurer and force them to cover the accident. The price of everyone’s car insurance would skyrocket, because the car insurance companies would be required to cover expensive accidents caused by irresponsible drivers that haven’t been paying into the system. That’s essentially what has happened to the health insurance market under ObamaCare.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The flip side of that coin is under the old model, sick patients who did not have health insurance through no fault of their own couldn’t get the insurance coverage they needed at prices they could afford.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Paul’s proposal to “allow any individual, including self-employed individuals, to form associations for the purpose of purchasing group health insurance” would go a long way toward solving this policy dilemma. If people could form their own associations and purchase health insurance as a group, the pre-existing conditions problem would mostly go away, because insurers would negotiate rates with the group knowing that some people might join over time with pre-existing conditions. The costs are built into the initial price negotiated and spread out amongst all those in the association. This is exactly how many employer-sponsored health insurance plans work today.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Church groups, advocacy organizations, charities, golf clubs, and virtually any other group of people could theoretically negotiate an association health plan under Paul’s provision, allowing like-minded people to take care of each other and providing those being insured with greater negotiating power.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Also worth noting is that if more people purchase insurance plans through non-employer private associations, it would help resolve the many issues that arise when people lose their jobs, providing greater health insurance stability.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Paul, himself a physician, understands that to solve the United States’ health care problems, we need innovative solutions like his proposal to expand association health plans. What we absolutely don’t need, however, is tweaks to a model that has long failed to provide affordable, quality health insurance coverage to all Americans.

The Battle Over Health Care At America's Medical Schools,"The voters thought they had spoken. First in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections—then again in the Massachusetts Senate race. When Scott Brown ran as the forty-first vote against government-run health care -- and won -- sixty one percent of the nation breathed a sigh of relief --according to a Rasmussen poll on February 11, 2010.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Game over? Not even close. Even if voters stop Washington’s current push toward universal health care, the battle for government-run medicine is far from over. The real future of American health care lies in the minds of our medical students. Under the cloak of compassion, a culture that believes government-run medicine defines quality care now permeates U.S. medical schools.                
                

            
                Progressives know they don’t have to win the current legislative battles in Washington. The key is to capture the American university… and wait. As medical students are taught to embrace the concept of government-run health care, the tipping point will inevitably come. With a new breed of physician to lead the charge, the rest will fall into place.                
                

            
                My wife and I are both medical students. Our institution makes no attempt to hide its bias in classroom instruction. From the first day of student orientation we are taught America’s current health care system is faulty because we spend more than any other country on health care yet our infant mortality rates lag behind other nations. However, there is no discussion of the data. Different countries use different definitions of a “live birth” -- making a direct comparison between countries impossible.                
                

            
                We are constantly told that American health care does not provide for all and that “universal health care” will solve these problems without any downside. However, we never hear that in America, 90.1% of women diagnosed with breast cancer are still alive five years later—but only 79% of their European counterparts survive this long. (That's according to Lancet Oncology from September 2007.)                
                

            
                We repeatedly hear that Canadians live longer than Americans. However, we are never told that when the data is adjusted for motor vehicle accidents and homicide, the United States leads the world in longevity. Shouldn’t this statistic be taught as well?                
                

            
                The excellence of the American system produces the majority of medical innovations. But this goes unmentioned. Instead we receive lectures entitled, “What America Can Learn From the Canadian Medical System,” “Universal Health Care,” and “Health Care Reform.” Typical bullet points in these lectures compare spending on AIDS in foreign countries versus spending on the Iraq war, as if they were direct substitutes. Is this academic freedom? Or is this viewpoint discrimination?                
                

            
                Explanations to the “correct” answers on test questions also contain liberal thought. Our medical school gave the left-leaning organization -- Physicians for Human Rights -- an official school e-mail address that enables them to send letters asking us to lobby our congressional representatives for liberal health care policies. Patient-centered organizations such as Physicians for Reform are never invited to present an alternative viewpoint.                 
                

            
                We were recently asked to watch and review Michael Moore’s movie “Sicko.” What was missing? The assignment of a movie that lays out the opposing point of view.                
                

            
                Medical school curricula should include material on delivery of health care and provide honest viewpoints from both sides using the best data available. I can count numerous examples of the school providing a liberal perspective, but cannot cite one single example where a more conservative position was offered. This steady drumbeat of the progressive worldview is reshaping the minds of America’s future physicians. Ironically, as medical students, we are taught to hold the patient’s best interest in the highest regard. Yet, at the same time, we are taught that more government intervention between the physician and the patient is desirable. Unfortunately, history teaches us the two are often incompatible.                
                

            
                The assault on the time honored patient-physician relationship is happening on many fronts. But the unseen battle within the medical school classroom might be the most important of them all. Will the physicians of tomorrow even recognize the Hippocratic Oath and continue to serve the well-being of the individual patient? Or will our healers become pawns of a government-run health care system and ultimately become servants of the State?                
                

            
                Nationalized health care has long been the Holy Grail for the secular progressive. To reach this end, the left is now doing a textbook end-around of the American voter to achieve this prize. What is happening in the medical school classroom might render what happens in Washington meaningless, no matter how We the People vote.

The Summit that Wasn’t—An Opportunity Squandered,"Few national issues are as personal or as complex as health care. The outcome of the current debate affects us all. Americans of every political stripe agree we need health care reform. The skyrocketing cost of care crushes American businesses even as millions of Americans go without access to the full continuum of care.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Given that our nation now borders on bankruptcy, few issues weigh more heavily on the American people than the thought of another trillion-dollar entitlement program. If the times were not so desperate Washington’s failure to work together would not be so shameful. However, what we witnessed on Thursday was political arrogance at its worst. We painfully watched Washington squander a golden opportunity to serve We the People—we watched a health care summit that never was.                
                

            
                The alleged purpose of the summit was to find common ground, to search for real and reachable answers to the difficult challenges that face our nation’s health care system. America hoped beyond hope that our government leaders would set politics aside, even if for only a moment, to serve the good of the people. But this was not to be.                
                

            
                At its core, health care is about the individual patient, the average American citizen. Viewed through that prism, President Obama’s approach to the health care summit is hard to explain. Last week’s CNN poll revealed only 25% of Americans want Congress to pass current legislation. Nearly double that, 48%, want Congress to scrap everything and start over with a clean slate. The rest have given up on the process altogether.                
                

            
                Given that President Obama’s plan has held on to the support of only one in four Americans, why did he begin the summit by refusing to honor Senator Alexander’s request to take reconciliation off the table? In effect, within the first few minutes, the president essentially told Republicans they must either agree with his plan, or he would ram current legislation through the Senate with 51 votes. The chance to start over with a clean sheet of paper and build on areas of agreement—the entire concept of a summit—was never a real possibility.                
                

            
                Republicans advanced several limited steps to move health care toward fiscal solvency while emphasizing patient and physician autonomy. Yet the Democrats rejected the concept of a stepwise approach in favor of sweeping reform crammed down the throats of 75% of American citizens (25% agree with the plan).                
                

            
                Americans are innately suspicious of sweeping government reform. They desperately want the problems with our health care system fixed, but they want the government to leave what works well enough alone. Voters are growing weary of the pork, payoffs, bribes, and backroom deals that now consume our capital. The Democrats have cut a deal with every major player at the table in an effort to gain control over health care reform and the American people know it.
The summit’s most poignant statement was made by Senator Kyl (R-Ariz.):                
                

            
                I think you framed the issue very well just a moment ago. Because there are some fundamental differences between us here that we cannot paper over. And Mr. President, when you said this is a philosophical debate and it is a legitimate debate, I agree with that. We do not agree about the fundamental question of who should be mostly in change. And you identified this question as central. Do you trust the states or do you trust Washington? Do you trust patients and doctors making the decisions or do you trust Washington?                
                

            
                This philosophical divide explains the inability of our president to hold a true summit -- a roundtable discussion designed to find common ground to fix the problems that face our nation’s health care system. The two sides on Thursday were engaged in a tug-of-war, pulling on opposite ends of the rope. Any reform moves power over health care decision making one way or the other—either toward Washington or toward patients and physicians.                
                

            
                The debate was not about finding solutions to the challenges that confront the American health care system. If it had been, enough common ground existed to agree on a series of limited reforms that would have easily passed both the House and Senate. In fact, the first three hours of the summit contained repeated statements from the Democratic majority about how close the two sides were.                
                

            
                However, the real debate was about the *transfer of power.* This explains why our government held the summit that wasn’t and wasted a golden opportunity to rise above partisan politics. In the mean time We the People still wait for true patient-centered health care reform with growing unrest.

Time for Obama to Pivot to Plan B,"Despite the best efforts of President Obama and leaders in Congress, it’s becoming clearer by the day that both are in need of a dramatically new direction. Unemployment is not improving, raising serious doubts about the Democrats’ fiscal policy agenda. Uncertainty about Afghanistan threatens to undermine progress in the region and further diminish confidence here at home. Enacting meaningful and cost-efficient health-care reform is hanging on by a thread.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Additionally, independent voters – the critical bloc that handed Mr. Obama the keys to the Oval Office – have turned against his pro-spending agenda.                
                

            
                All presidents learn the lesson that they cannot bend history to their will. Plan A is almost always impossible and successful presidents learn to pivot to Plan B.

Fortunately, there is a proven Plan B strategy Mr. Obama can follow. It’s the modern day version of the Bill Clinton playbook, post-1994. It calls for separating from liberal old bulls in Congress, embracing the Republicans’ most common sense proposals, serving as the responsible guardian of the republic from the excesses of each, and viewing every policy idea through the prism of economic growth and opportunity.                
                

            
                What should the strategy look like now?                
                

            
                It starts with building a new national consensus with a sense of common purpose. Mr. Obama should address the nation to lament the partisanship that has overtaken nearly every facet of his administration’s first-year agenda, remind the American people that blue states and red states exist only in political punditry, and acknowledge that as circumstances have changed, so should our collective goals and policy priorities.                
                

            
                In the address, he reaffirms his position that a consensus on health care reform is essential to stabilizing the economy, reducing the deficit, and creating new jobs. But he also acknowledges that the system can only be reformed in the context of cost containment, broad economic growth and continued research, investment and private-sector innovation.                
                

            
                And as such, he invites a hand-picked group of moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans to the White House to negotiate a new, modest, bipartisan proposal to cut the deficit, create jobs, and introduce incremental reforms to our health care and energy systems.                
                

            
                For Mr. Obama, it means embracing popular conservative ideas like tort reform and interstate competition, alongside popular liberal ideas like guaranteed coverage despite pre-existing conditions. He should champion a sensible, moderate middle ground, like Olympia Snowe’s “trigger” and Tom Carper’s “hammer,” both of which would delay the implementation of the public option, until at least other reforms are first absorbed into the system.

It means dramatically scaling back the tax increases and Medicare cuts, in deference to the temporary recession, while reminding Americans that when times improve, tough decisions must be revisited. For now, though, offer the bipartisan negotiators a portion of unspent stimulus money to defray the costs of health care or job creation -- even offer Republicans some of it for a job-creating tax cut.

Above all, it means tying health care reform to complementary proposals to grow the economy, decrease the deficit, cut back wasteful spending, accelerate work on the new electricity grid and other urgent, job-creating programs. In the process, transform it from a conspicuous distraction to a seamlessly integrated part of a larger agenda that speaks to the nation’s immediate needs.
On taxes, Mr. Obama should encourage temporary payroll tax holidays to help small businesses struggling to survive the recession, not allow the Bush-era tax cuts to expire in 2010 and publicly recognize the power of tax incentives to create high-paying private sector jobs. Every tax policy and program should be scrubbed for immediate potential to create jobs and if it doesn't meet a specific set of criteria, it should be set aside indefinitely.                
                

            
                On Afghanistan, the administration should embrace centrist, cost-effective ideas, such as Senator Nelson’s (D-Neb.) proposal to reintroduce the sale of war bonds that helped fund World War II. With the government sitting on more than $17 billion in war bonds, any alternative measure, including the introduction of a war tax against a bleak economic forecast, would further undermine the American people’s confidence in our mission and carry serious consequences for both Democrats and Republicans in the 2010 elections.                
                

            
                With a revised agenda rooted in a sense of common purpose and based on proven pro-growth principles, centrist Democrats would be relieved, independents would be reenergized, and most Republicans would simply try to take credit. A new governing coalition would emerge with the president at its head. Members of Congress who reject the new consensus would marginalize themselves on both sides.                
                

            
                This is not only the best chance Mr. Obama has to rescue health care reform, create jobs, fix the economy and sufficiently justify our ongoing presence in Afghanistan -– it could be the ONLY chance to reclaim his agenda and preserve the Democratic congressional majorities he needs to convince the American people that he's worthy of a second term.

              The Democratic Party is a mess. It has no effective national leader. It has no serious agenda. And Democrats have no idea how to win back the Rust Belt voters who propelled the ultimate political outsider, Donald J. Trump, to the presidency.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              During President Obama’s eight years in office the Democrats became primarily a coastal party that caters to out-of-touch wealthy elitists in liberal enclaves like Manhattan and Hollywood, while ignoring the hardworking Americans who are the backbone of our country.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats lost election after election during the Obama years, as voters strongly rejected the party’s bankrupt policies. In fact, according to a Fox News report, President Obama’s tenure was marked by an embarrassing “net loss of 1,042 state and federal Democratic posts, including congressional and state legislative seats, governorships and the presidency.”  
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Forgotten voters in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina – whose families had voted for Democrats since President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s time – have finally had enough. They feel like they’ve lost their country and that their leaders in Washington have lost faith in them.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Americans hailing from states that President Trump carried have well-founded beliefs about what today’s Democrat Party stands for – and it’s not good.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              Then Donald Trump came into their communities, talking America First, American jobs, and American exceptionalism. Trump has backed those words up with an optimistic agenda anchored on the central promise to get Americans working again. The Make American Great Again effort is focused on reform: tax reform, trade reform, regulatory reform, domestic energy production reform, and health care reform.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Just a few days ago, nine months since being shell-shocked by the epic Trump victory, the Democrats rolled out a new, weak agenda. Washington Democrats clearly felt pressure to put forth something – anything – new because their allies in the mainstream media told them they needed to put new wrapping paper on their old and failed ideas.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that only 37 percent of the American people think that the Democratic Party stands for something. And 52 percent said all that the Democrats do is oppose President Trump. This polling data reflects reality. President Trump has been in office for six months and the Democrats up until now have done nothing more than run a permanent obstruction campaign against the president and his agenda.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The truth is that Americans hailing from states that President Trump carried have well-founded beliefs about what today’s Democrat Party stands for – and it’s not good. These folks think that the Democrats are the party of big government, bureaucratic decision-making, high taxes, open borders, abortion on demand, and weakness around the globe. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I will go a step further and offer what I hear from the liberals in Washington and in the mainstream media about what I would call the real Democrat agenda:

              This list represents the deep hole that Democrats have dug for themselves outside of their shrinking far-left base.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The idea that ultra-liberals like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York City,  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, or Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of the People’s Republic of Vermont have any intention of fixing or even acknowledging the problems facing ordinary Americans is absurd.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This is all an upside for Republicans, for President Trump’s America First agenda and for the president’s promise to prioritize the working men and women in America’s heartland.

Health Care Reform Isn’t Over,"The Congressional Budget Office just made waves by announcing that President Obama’s health care reforms will cost about $115 billion more than initially predicted. That add-on pushes the 10-year cost of the measure over the administration's unofficial $1-trillion limit.

The CBO's new report serves as a stirring reminder that America’s health care problems didn’t disappear the day the president signed the bill into law. Even Democrats acknowledge that the reform effort is incomplete and leaves some of our biggest health care challenges -- like cost-containment -- unresolved.

Lawmakers need to fix these flaws. They must stress to the American public that health care requires additional attention, particularly as this fall's election approaches. But in so doing, they need to avoid the hyper-partisan rhetoric that’s infected the health care debate in the past.

Democrats and Republicans alike first must acknowledge what the reform effort got right. Paramount among the law's achievements are the new public subsidies for low-income patients to purchase private insurance and the state exchanges that will help small businesses secure affordable coverage for their employees.

Unfortunately, the law also has several shortcomings. One such blunder is the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) -- a new agency charged with identifying ways to cut Medicare spending. The IPAB's mission is on target, but as currently constructed, it is dangerously unaccountable. Further, the new agency doesn’t even have the authority to make recommendations concerning the parts of Medicare that are most responsible for escalating costs.

The law also doesn’t address the spiraling costs that plague other parts of our health care system. Indeed, when crafting the bill, lawmakers devoted much more energy to expanding coverage than dealing with the rising price of medical services and health insurance.

The CBO estimates that premiums for many kinds of insurance plans will drop only marginally over the next decade -- if they decrease at all. Prices for individual insurance policies are actually projected to go up by 10 to 13 percent.

Legislators who voted for the bill need to acknowledge these problems in the run-up to this fall's elections. And they need to tell the public how they plan to solve them.

At the same time, legislators who opposed the reform effort must offer tangible solutions for our country's health care problems. Calls to repeal the bill are politically unrealistic and counterproductive. Many of the law's provisions are popular and will resolve some of our health care system's most vexing issues.

One policy prescription that can be at the center of every candidate's platform this fall -- Democrat and Republican alike -- is improved support for pharmaceutical drug innovation.

New drugs cut down on long-term health costs by preventing serious illness and therefore obviating the need for expensive in-patient services, like surgery. In fact, Columbia University Professor Frank Lichtenberg has shown that the health care system saves over $7 for every dollar spent on new drugs.

A similar study from the journal Medical Care found that every dollar expended on drugs that treat blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes translates into $4 to $7 in savings elsewhere.

Cutting-edge medicines are the product of in-lab innovations. The government can do more to support that work. For starters, public schools need to improve science and math education. America’s youth are the medical researchers of tomorrow. But too many aren’t developing the basic cognitive tools necessary to enter the field.

Lawmakers should also encourage scientists and firms to undertake potentially risky drug development projects. New public financing for promising lines of research would expedite the discovery of new treatments and yield long-term cost-savings.

Finally, our leaders must streamline the drug-approval process. At present, that process can take years. Oftentimes, the prospect of an arduous wait for approval discourages researchers from even starting the expensive research process. Safe, effective medications shouldn’t run up against undue or arbitrary barriers. Regulatory delays can actually increase health costs by keeping potentially cost-lowering treatments off the market.

Our quest to fix our health care system is far from over. But our leaders will never complete the task at hand if they regress into petty partisan bickering. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle must acknowledge the reform effort's mistakes and put forward policies that will fix them.

Wrong Way Obama,"U.S. President Barack Obama makes remarks at the daily briefing after a surprise visit to the Brady Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, July 24, 2009. Obama said he should have chosen his words more carefully when he said police ""acted stupidly"" in arresting a prominent black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, touching off a debate over race.   REUTERS/Jim Young (UNITED STATES POLITICS CRIME LAW)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Using four points on the political compass, the direction our president is going in is turning him into ""Wrong Way Obama.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                When you plot the president's path regarding money, message, messenger and momentum -all strengths for him during his campaign - his recent trend lines are all heading the 'wrong way'.                
                

            
                On money, a Los Angeles Times poll found ""90 percent of Americans are worried, to some degree, about the exploding federal spending deficit"" and a recent Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that ""only 25% of U.S. voters now say the stimulus plan has helped the economy."" On message, a CBS News poll determined that 52 percent believe Obama is trying to ""accomplish too much"" and 57 percent see the country on the ""wrong track."" On messenger, while the president remains popular as a person his ratings for actually doing his job and on specific issues have been dropping to levels that threaten his aggressive liberal agenda.                
                

            
                This is reflected in momentum. The July 26 daily Rasmussen poll shows the continuation of slipping support for Obama. Only 49 percent of Americans at least somewhat approve of the president's job performance. Below 50 percent approval for an incumbent is a danger sign. When the question becomes one of ""strong"" approval or disapproval Obama's rating is minus 11, a new low point for the president and the first time this negative is in double digits. Only 29 percent strongly approve versus 40 percent who strongly disapprove.                
                

            
                In a July 9 Rasmussen poll, voters trusted Republicans more than Democrats on eight out of ten key electoral issues, including the number one concern, the economy and also national security, taxes, immigration and government ethics.                
                

            
                On the one issue the president is currently most urgent about - health care reform - his call for quick passage of legislation reflects the momentum that is building against him. Public support for Obama's handling of health care reform is at a new low of 49 percent and support for health care legislation in Congress is even lower, just 44 percent, in the latest Rasmussen national telephone survey of likely voters.                
                

            
                As the president heads the wrong way on matters of money, message, messenger and momentum it again raises a question that has followed him since his election. Will he turn out as a president to be more like Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton? Like Obama, both Carter and Clinton began with high personal popularity. Like Obama, both men strenuously pushed liberal policies. However, at the end of Carter's presidency he was reviled personally and as a leader. At the end of Clinton's presidency, he maintained personal popularity despite his roguish misadventures and he was judged favorably because of a strong economy.                
                

            
                It's too soon to tell if Obama will suffer a Carter-like meltdown or will exhibit a Clinton-like ability to course correct when his policy priorities prove unpopular. It is, however, intriguing to reach back in history to two other ""wrong way"" figures to put Obama's motivations into context.                
                

            
                In the 1929 Rose Bowl game between Georgia Tech and the University of California, Cal's star center and linebacker, Roy Riegels, recovered a Tech player's fumble and raced toward the end zone - in the wrong direction! Although tackled just a yard short of the wrong end zone, Riegels' reverse run set up a series of plays that resulted in his team losing. For the rest of his life he was nicknamed ""Wrong Way Riegels."" Riegels later said he had lost his bearings as he pivoted to elude an opposing player. He said running the wrong way was an unintentional mistake.                
                

            
                Between the years 1935-37, an airplane mechanic named Douglas Corrigan wanted to repeat the 1927 solo trans-Atlantic flight of his hero, Charles Lindbergh. But Corrigan was repeatedly denied permission because regulators deemed his plane unsafe and inadequately equipped for such a long journey. On July 17, 1938, after flying cross- country from California to New York, Corrigan filed a flight plan to return to California. Instead, his plane took off at 5:15 the next morning, heading the wrong way - east. Twenty-eight hours and 13 minutes later, he landed at a Dublin, Ireland aerodrome and despite his claims of confusion it was an obvious ruse. However, his daring charmed people around the world. He became an international celebrity, immortalized by the nickname ""Wrong Way Corrigan.""                
                

            
                So, will Obama wind up seeming more similar to: Carter, Clinton, Wrong Way Riegels or Wrong Way Corrigan? Whether he ends his presidency as ""Wrong Way Obama"" depends on how he recovers fumbles, the flight plan he chooses, how and why he makes any changes in direction and where he and the country land.

"Five reasons Americans already love ObamaCare — plus one reason why they’re gonna love it even more, soon","There’s a reason Republicans have been rushing to try and defund the Affordable Care Act before October 1, when major sections of the law take effect.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Republicans know what polls show — that most Americans don’t know what’s in ObamaCare, but when told what the law actually includes, a strong majority support the law.                
                

            
                Once state health insurance exchanges take effect, and premiums for all Americans go down, Republicans know the law will only become more popular and harder to repeal.

                1.  ACA allows young Americans to stay on their parents’ insurance plans                
                

            
                Because of ObamaCare, which allows kids to stay on their parents insurance plans until age 26, 3.4 million young Americans now have coverage.                  
                

            
                The percentage of uninsured young people (ages 19 to 25) fell accordingly, from 48% in 2010 to 21% in 2012.                 
                

            
                According to polling, three-in-four Americans support this part of the Affordable Care Act including, yes, over two-thirds of Republicans.                  
                

            
                2.  ACA bans insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions                
                

            
                Another aspect of ObamaCare that has already taken effect is the ban on insurance companies denying coverage to patients based on pre-existing conditions.                  
                

            
                That means an end to insurance company horror stories like four-month-old Alex Lange being denied health insurance because he was too chubby.                 
                

            
                This is why the conservative allegation about death panels is so ironic; while the actual ACA law does not contain death panels or anything remotely like them, the fact is that prior to ObamaCare, insurance companies were effectively operating like death panels in denying life-saving coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition and by applying life-time spending caps on coverage.                
                

            
                The ban on pre-existing condition limits, which will apply to every single American by 2014, is supported by 83% of Americans.                 
                

            
                3.  ACA offers tax credits to small businesses to buy insurance                
                

            
                The Affordable Care Act expands tax credits to help small businesses provide health insurance to their workers.  Companies with fewer than 50 employees do not have to provide insurance, but even for these businesses, ObamaCare will make it easier and cheaper if they choose to do so.                  
                

            
                According to polling, 88% of Americans think these small business tax credits are great, including — wait for it ... yes, 83% of Republicans.  That’s right, over eight-in-ten Republicans support the provision of ObamaCare that helps small businesses afford and expand their health insurance offerings to employees.                 
                

            
                4.  ACA requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide health insurance                
                

            
                Over 96% of companies with more than 50 employees already provide health insurance to their employees.  And contrary to Republicans claiming otherwise, studies show the vast majority of those employers do not plan to drop or reduce that coverage because of ObamaCare.                  
                

            
                Also, there is no evidence that ObamaCare has led to companies slashing full-time workers.  In fact, since ObamaCare passed in March 2010, over 90% of the gain in employment has been full-time positions.                 
                

            
                Still, we know that companies that can afford to provide health insurance to their workers and yet fail to do so off-set the costs of care onto the rest of us — whether the cost of emergency room treatment that gets passed on to other consumers, or Medicaid coverage that we pay for as taxpayers.                  
                

            
                In Florida alone, more than 50,000 workers at companies like McDonald’s and Burger King are on the state’s Medicaid rolls.  Especially with tax credits available to small businesses, there is no excuse for companies to pass the buck.  And 75% of Americans support this element of ObamaCare.                
                

            
                5.  ACA provides subsidies to help individuals afford coverage                
                

            
                Many of the 45 million Americans who lack health insurance simply don’t have enough money to afford coverage.  ObamaCare will lower the cost of premiums but also provide subsidies to help low- and middle-income Americans purchase insurance.                 
                

            
                Americans who earn $45,000 per year (about 400% of the federal poverty level) will qualify for some form of subsidy.  The amount of the subsidy will be based on income as well as the cost of health coverage in a particular state but, for instance, according to a subsidy calculator created by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a 27-year-old living in Houston, Texas, who earns just $15,000 a year could sign-up for a mid-level plan for about $300 per year with the help of subsidies.  Without subsidies, that plan would cost $2,400 per year.                  
                

            
                The few Americans who think subsidizing care is a bad idea should, again, note that we already subsidize health care to a far greater degree in the form of Medicaid and also when the uninsured rely on free emergency room care and pass those astronomical costs on to the rest of us.  But most Americans — 76% to be exact — support the individual subsidy.  That includes 61% of Republicans.                
                

            
                There’s even more aspects of ObamaCare that the American people already support — including the employer mandate, the increased Medicare payroll tax on higher-income Americans and the expansion of Medicaid.                   
                

            
                And then, starting October 1, here’s one more:                
                

            
                6.  State-based health insurance exchanges                
                

            
                Americans of all political stripes like choice and competition, which is precisely what the ObamaCare health insurance exchanges will create.  So it’s no wonder that 80% of Americans — including 72% of Republicans — support the health insurance exchange program in ObamaCare.  And that’s even before the exchanges have taken effect!                  
                

            
                Plus, a new report shows that health insurance premiums will be even lower under ObamaCare than originally projected.                  
                

            
                Personally, as someone who pays through the nose for individual insurance in New York State — a state where, historically, few individual insurance options have even been available — I can’t wait to enroll in ObamaCare and see my premiums plummet, as they are expected to by at least 50%.                  
                

            
                Again, all this is why Republicans are in such a desperate rush to try and defund ObamaCare before October 1 — even if it means holding our economy hostage and even if most voters, including Republicans, oppose the repeated and wasteful defunding attempts.                  
                

            
                After all, the law is already popular when it’s not fully in effect and most people haven’t felt its benefits.  We all know what will happen when ObamaCare takes effect — and works!                 
                

            
                Republicans who are throwing temper tantrums over sour grapes need to grow up.                  
                

            
                Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, President Obama signed it into law and the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality.                  
                

            
                The cost of doing nothing on health care reform was too great and the cost of repeatedly refighting the political battles of the past is obscene.  But then again, it makes perfect sense why Republicans refuse to just give up and shut up — because the minute they do, there will be no more distractions from all the good things about ObamaCare.

Americans Don't Want Government-Funded Abortions In Health Reform,"President Obama’s strategy of avoiding the abortion issue in order to successfully pass health care reform isn’t going so well. His repeated claims that health care legislation will not fund abortion have done little to prevent national headlines like, “Abortion Fight Complicates Debate on Health Care.” Major media outlets from Time magazine to the Associated Press and the non-partisan Factcheck.org (hardly bastions of pro-life praise) report that abortion funding will be included in the president’s health plan before Congress.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Even opposition from his own party is significant. Forty Democrats in the House of Representatives have joined Congressman Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) to challenge the president’s assertion, pledging to oppose health care reform without changes to existing legislative language allowing abortion coverage.                
                

            
                From the other side, abortion advocates tee off on the phony compromise amendment sponsored by Rep. Lois Capps (D-NY). According to supporters, the amendment ensures only “private funds” will fund abortion on-demand. This is simply not true.                
                

            
                A recent fact-check piece in The New York Times explained why the claims of private money funding abortion are really a farce. The paper reported, “in practice, the public and private money would all go into the same pot, and the source of money for any single procedure is largely a technicality.”                
                

            
                The reality is, if the president’s plan goes forward, checks will be written to abortionists and to health insurers covering abortions. Those checks will draw funds from one place: the treasury of the United States of America. This expansion of official government support for the abortion industry is a stark departure from current policy restricting abortion funding via the Hyde Amendment.                
                

            
                Any new health care program will not be funded through the traditional Department of Health and Human Services appropriations process. For this reason, the Hyde Amendment, which traditionally restricts federal funds for Medicaid abortions through that process, will not apply to the new program.                
                

            
                Opportunities have arisen to codify Hyde in health care reform legislation. An effort by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) to permanently codify Hyde restrictions in the Senate health care bill were soundly defeated in the Senate Finance Committee last week.                
                

            
                And if abortion advocates’ misrepresentations of the bill’s true impact weren’t enough, now many of them are claiming that American women somehow want and deserve government-funded abortion on-demand. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) called Hatch’s efforts to ensure abortion coverage is excluded from health care reform “insulting” to American women.                
                

            
                Yet a nationwide poll released by the Susan B. Anthony List and conducted by Public Opinion Strategies found the president and Congressional leaders lose more than they gain by including abortion coverage in health care reform. Americans are not clamoring for government-funded abortion on demand – not Democrats, not Independents, and certainly not women.                
                

            
                In fact, by including government-funded abortion in health care reform, the president turns off five times more voters than he gains. Overall, 58% of Americans say the government does not have an obligation to provide abortion services under a public health plan. Over half of Americans (women included) say it is wrong for the government to pay for abortions.                
                

            
                This may be surprising to elites but it is not to the rest of America. Americans realize radical feminists in favor of abortion rights have dramatically over-represented a minority position, misstating the centrality and ‘need’ for abortion on-demand.                
                

            
                Public opposition to abortion on-demand is rising, as reflected in last week’s polling released by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. Record numbers of Americans support commonsense restrictions on abortion. Experts at Pew attributed this increase in part to the abortion-friendly agenda of the Obama administration.                
                

            
                If Congressional leadership and the president fall on the sword of abortion coverage-- pleasing abortion allies and weaving it into the fabric of our daily lives-- they do so at the peril of the entire bill and their own political futures.                
                

            
                American women deserve health care reform that honors the life of both mother and child, not one that prescribes a government-funded mandate for abortion on-demand and makes American taxpayers complicit in almost every abortion. Without language that explicitly excludes abortion funding from health care reform, Congress will have a compelling reason to reject the president’s health care proposal – the will of the American people. Votes have consequences, and America is watching.

Demise of the Dinosaurs In Congress,"The days of the institutional politician may well be over. Generally speaking in the days of yore, if you were an incumbent running for re-election, no matter your party affiliation, you had a leg up on all challengers. Not so anymore.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The American people are angry and frustrated at politicians who see themselves as ""untouchable"" and ""sure things"" for re-election. Citizens feel that lawmakers are not listening to the people and are taking them for granted. Voters today believe that elected office should be an opportunity and NOT a career. Americans today believe you should serve and get out.                
                

            
                Some politicians have seen the handwriting on the wall and have decided not to stand for re-election this fall. The rejection of incumbents is not necessarily limited to one party over the other. A question soon to be answered is how will the electorate treat incumbent legislators who give up
one position only to run for another. Will they still be treated as ""incumbents?"" Lets look at who has thrown in the towel so far, voluntarily or otherwise:

                Back in 1994 when Democrats took a beating at the polls and lost control of Congress few forecasted that devastating storm. Today, there is no doubt among political insiders and armchair pundits that 2010 will not be the year of the ""incumbent"" and since most incumbents are Democrats, it will not be the year of the ""Democrat.""                
                

            
                What will make the perfect storm for Republicans to make a comeback? Here is what political scholar Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia says:                
                

            
                ""What ultimately happens in 2010 could depend on how closely the electoral backdrop next year resembles 1994. At this point, there are some strong similarities. Like Bill Clinton a decade and a half ago, Obama is an ambitious young Democratic president who has seen his poll numbers drop sharply in the opening months of his administration. And like Clinton, Obama has invested a good bit of his political capital into a massive effort to overhaul the nation's health care system. As in 1994, it is so complex an undertaking that foes are finding it much easier to pillory the project as 'big government' than supporters are able to defend it as needed reform.""                
                

            
                An obvious target for the GOP in fashioning a comeback would be a seat that they recently held­namely, those lost in the Democratic surges of 2006 and 2008. In the last two election cycles, Democrats scored a net gain of 55 House seats­consolidating their grip in the Northeast, while expanding their beachheads in the nation's heartland. Most of their gains were made in three distinct parts of the country­the Republican-leaning South, the increasingly competitive Mountain West, and the battleground states of the industrial Midwest.                
                

            
                As a result, these newly minted Democratic seats are in large part in competitive, even difficult, terrain. Roughly three-fourths of the districts (42) voted Republican for president in at least one of the last two elections. Twenty-one districts voted for the GOP presidential candidate in both 2004 and 2008.                
                

            
                Polling today more than suggests that members of Congress face the most anti-incumbent electorate since 1994. According to a recent Washington Post/ABC poll, less than one-third of all voters say they are inclined to support their current representatives this November.                
                

            
                I believe that what has many Americans so upset, is the fact that the Democrats -- who control all branches of government with high majorities -- have not concentrated on what most Americans care about most, i.e., the economy, jobs and the rising debt. Since taking power in 2009, Democrats have focused almost entirely on health care reform and increased government spending and deficits. Americans kept asking themselves, ""What good is affordable health care, if I do not have a job to pay for it?""                
                

            
                The American people will send a message this November. It will say to politicians, listen to the people and be responsive to our needs. The American people will send a strong and clear message that elected officials are sent to serve the people not the other way around.

"When Hillary Clinton wields the word 'honestly' it's time to watch out, America","Now Playing                            Has Hillary secured her nomination?                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Hillary Clinton and her supporters are basking in the glow of what they believe was her shining performance in the first Democratic debate, but she—and they—should beware when the spotlight turns to the whopper of a lie she told on stage.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Clinton said, “I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.”                 
                

            
                Pull out the fact checkers when Hillary Clinton uses the word “honestly.”                
                

            
                Honestly, Hillary shape shifts between describing herself as a progressive and a moderate depending on who she thinks she needs to pander to on a given day. For example, at a Women for Hillary event in Ohio last month, Clinton said, ""You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty."" Yet in the recent Democratic debate and in a previous campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton averred, “I take a backseat to no one when you look at my record in standing up and fighting for progressive values.”

                Behind a backseat is an exhaust pipe and it is exhausting to keep track of how often Clinton has flip-flopped and not stood her ground regarding “progressive values,” as Politico’s Jack Shafer pointed out after the debate.                
                

            
                “She has reversed her positions on gay marriage, immigration, gun control, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, mass incarceration and the Iraq War, and some believe her recent stand on the Keystone XL pipeline constitutes a flip, too.”                
                

            
                In addition to flip-flopping, Clinton has proved herself to be a Cirque du Soleil contortionist about being honest and trustworthy regarding the rest of her debate declaration.                
                

            
                Clinton may like to get things done but she is inexperienced and ineffective at getting things done well. She is particularly bad at finding “common ground.” Here is a partial list of her failures throughout her career:                
                

            
                · When she was first lady, her husband, Bill, tasked her with health care reform. She proceeded to run her task force in secret and produce a 1,324-page blueprint that was so riddled with unpopular government mandates, coercion and bureaucracy that even a Democratic-controlled Congress wouldn’t vote on it. The debacle of “Hillarycare” helped lead to the 1994 Republican takeover of both the House and Senate for the first time since the 83rd Congress of 1953-1954.                
                

            
                ·  In the Huffington Post, here is how columnist Adam Hanft described Clinton’s record as a U.S. senator from New York: “When she talks about ‘sponsoring’ and ‘introducing’ and ‘fighting for’ legislation that obviously hasn't passed, that's a smokescreen for failure. For many of the bills she introduced, she couldn't even get a cosponsor in her own party!” Hanft goes on to give seven examples of Clinton’s inability to muster even a single Democratic cosponsor for her bills (let alone a Republican) on topics like terrorism, crime, health care and energy. Hanft concluded, “It's a track record of legislative failure and futility.”                
                

            
                ·  As secretary of state, Clinton took charge of a series of “resets” that proved to be upsets with catastrophic consequences. There was the “Russian reset” that “began with the Obama administration’s reneging on a pre-existing American commitment to supply defensive technology to shield Poland and the Czech Republic from missile attacks [which] left both countries vulnerable to pressures and threats from Russia” and continued with Russia’s bloody annexation of Crimea. Under Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, there were interventionist “resets” in Egypt and Libya that “led to Islamic extremists’ taking over in Egypt and terrorist chaos in [Benghazi] Libya, where the American ambassador was killed, along with three other Americans.” Look at Iran, Syria, China, North Korea and at our ally, Israel—indeed, look anywhere worldwide. Name one instance of Clinton accomplishing anything of significance to mitigate the spread of terrorism, stop the slaughter of Christians and Jews, and make America safer.                
                

            
                Speaking of her deleted emails and private server when she was secretary of state, Clinton said, “I’ve gone longer and farther to try to be as transparent as possible. Nobody else has done that.”                
                

            
                Transparent? Trustworthy? Truthful? Accomplished? None other than New York’s Democratic Senator, Chuck Schumer, put it this way: “She is the most opaque person you will ever meet in your life.”                
                

            
                Is that who we want as America’s commander in chief—as the leader of the free world?

ObamaCare repeal: GOP leaders are missing their chance,"Now Playing                            White House and GOP push to revive health care reform                                                                                                 
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                America has endured for generations because our Constitutional framework and our collective commitment to liberty protects us against the inevitable failures of our government and its leadership. Yet, when it comes to the current debate over health care, GOP leaders are abandoning these safeguards and risking not just our access to quality health care but something far greater.                                               ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                To be sure, most tangibly for the many Americans for whom rising health care costs and diminishing access to quality care is a very real, daily concern, the decisions we make will have lasting and very serious consequences. These are the reasons to fully repeal ObamaCare immediately and to then respect the states and the free market to give us the options to get the best health care possible.                 
                

            
                Yet, incomprehensibly, Congressional leaders are choosing not to do so and have abandoned their constituents in a series of negotiations – most recently for state “waivers” and other crumbs of liberty – that have little actual hope of meaningfully honoring their campaign commitments to fully repeal ObamaCare and reform health care markets.  Unfortunately, there are much larger implications to their lack of boldness.                
                

            
                First, Congress is turning away from the free market.  Republicans talk a big game about believing in free enterprise and capitalism. But the grassroots out in real America see their actions as more cronyism than principle. Whether it’s subsidizing big corporations through the Export-Import Bank or the more recent $100 billion insurer slush fund included in the American Health Care Act, the grassroots understandably consider Congress’ actions to be political pay-offs and more of Washington picking winners and losers rather than the free market at work.                
                

            
                So when those who claim to promote freedom refuse to legislatively repeal market-constricting regulations and then “replace” ObamaCare subsidies with new -- and arguably more expansive -- subsidies in the form of refundable tax credits, it makes one wonder.  Which party is for less government intervention?                  
                

            
                Second, Congress is continuing the trend of ceding its Article I legislating powers to others, in particular the administrative state.  The Legislative Branch – hiding behind the intricacies of Senate rules and the Budget Act – has been selling “repeal” in a future second phase at the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Tom Price’s ability to repeal ObamaCare administratively.  Setting aside the fact little meaningful repeal can be accomplished administratively beyond tinkering at the margins, the more troubling concern is why our elected leaders refuse to just do what they have the power and duty to do and have repeatedly promised to do.                 
                

            
                This is a pattern. Congress frequently punts. Take President Obama’s illegal Executive Amnesty. The Congressional GOP could have used its Article I powers to stop funding any implementation of that executive action.  But it didn’t even entertain that idea, choosing instead to leave it to states like Texas to fight in the courts.  Moreover, during the 2013 defund fight, Republican Congressional leaders hid behind not having 50 votes in the Senate and not having a GOP-controlled White House. The conservative grassroots being skeptical of their position questioned their sincerity. And here we are.  Since the repeal effort stalled, a possible “deal” is being floated to permit Governors to seek “waivers.” The simple truth is Republicans seemingly would rather hide behind conjecture and procedural theory while punting responsibility.                
                

            
                Third, the health care debate today centers almost entirely on the word “repeal,”  and while it has been a rallying cry for conservatives, it is too much now an end to itself.  It’s just a word.  And it’s a word that is all about process and politics, not really substance.  Congressional leadership is so wrapped up in the idea of “repeal,” that it has become a political box-checking exercise rather than a commitment to ensure Americans actually receive better health care at more affordable costs.                
                

            
                Worse, this exercise is not actually checking the box! If one aims to repeal ObamaCare – a law built upon subsidies, regulations and Medicaid expansion – how can one honestly look at your constituents and claim to have repealed it with a new law built upon subsidies, regulations and continued, albeit slightly limited, Medicaid expansion? Even if they allow a theoretical waiver for states, it defies common sense to claim this is repeal.                
                

            
                Finally and most importantly, GOP leaders are missing their chance to win the minds and hearts of the American people. They are denying a new generation of Americans the ability to understand and embrace constitutionally limited government, federalism, free markets and the opportunities those ideals create.                  
                

            
                The Republican Party has been afforded a historic moment in time to transform America’s health care system to one that offers the best we could dream of – plenty of doctors, low cost insurance options, affordable medicine - all while maximizing the number of individuals receiving the care they need.                 
                

            
                Instead, Congressional leaders are defining the debate in terms of tax reductions and supposed out-year cost savings instead of how to increase the supply of high quality health care that is available and affordable to actual human beings.                  
                

            
                This fight over health care reform will come and go, but the lasting impact of how it is fought will be significant.                  
                

            
                If Congress is nothing more than a box-checking regime that will overstate its own actions to claim success while further ceding its own Constitutional powers and abandoning the free market – then America will completely lose its identity.                
                

            
                This is what is at stake.                 
                

            
                Congress has a choice – and it ought to choose the principles that made this country great and that they claim to believe in, not the failed Washington-centric policies that have been the problem all along.

Media Cast First Vote for Health Care,"Health care reform is a done deal. This isn’t much of a surprise. The Democrats had the entire U.S. Treasury to fall back on to bribe members of Congress. But that wasn’t their only advantage.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                During the final weeks of the fight, all eyes were on the battle for health care reform. In Ohio, one Obama supporter shouted, “We need courage.” She was wrong. -- They needed votes and they got them.                
                

            
                Democratic leaders counted the shifting vote tally time and again, first bullying Rep. Kucinich and then coercing Rep. Stupak into supporting Obamacare. But one ally never wavered. One has backed nationalized health care from the very beginning. Now it’s time for the president to thank his strongest supporter.                
                

            
                The media.                
                

            
                Obama should buy the mainstream media a gift since they’ve bought the Democratic Party line that his national health care reform is a good idea.                
                

            
                It didn’t matter whether it was NBC using the Winter Olympics to tell a positive story about Canada’s socialized health system or Time senior political analyst Mark Halperin saying it’s “immoral” that America is “the only industrialized democracy that doesn’t cover every citizen.” Journalists in the United States told one side of the story: Obama’s.                
                

            
                From the president’s attack on insurers to the bogus prediction the bill was going to pass any day to claims that opponents were “Astroturf” or phony grassroots, the media mirrored the president’s position almost constantly. The Washington Post went so far as to cede much of its coverage of the issue to liberal blogger Ezra Klein, who naturally supported even the lamest attempt at national health care.                
                

            
                Nearly a year ago, during what ABC’s Diane Sawyer called “D-Day for health care” reform, the broadcast networks devoted 10 stories to Obama’s May 11 speech. Only one of those segments included a critic. And Sawyer was using the talking point for the administration's plan, claiming it would benefit patients. “What’s the first thing they’ll do for you and your family?” It was inconceivable to journalists that the result of so-called health care reform might do something to most Americans, not for them.                
                

            
                ABC’s Terry Moran reversed the famous John F. Kennedy line calling on people to “ask not what you country can do for you – ask what you can do for you country.” To Moran, Obama’s speech calling for another government mandate was presidential and showed how Obama “sought to draw on the grand rhetorical tradition of President Kennedy and others, trying to summon the country to a great and necessary endeavor.” But that's not JFK-like; it’s not even JFK-lite.                
                

            
                Those pesky, ordinary voters who dared oppose something so “great and necessary” were labeled ""radical"" or ""dangerous"" and abused in the media. Even this week, MSNBC’s looniest guy without a show, David Shuster, claimed tea party protesters were “far right” and said they were “going nuts” because of maneuvering on the Hill.                
                

            
                His nuttier colleagues had worse things to say about the voters who opposed health care reform. “Hardball” host Chris Matthews blamed it on racism: “I think some of the people are upset because we have a black president.” Fellow host Keith Olbermann preferred to blame tea partiers for another ism … “terrorism.” “When Hamas does it or Hezbollah does it, it is called terrorism. Why should Republican lawmakers and the Astroturf groups organizing on behalf of the health care industry be viewed any differently?” he ranted.                
                

            
                The few folks who watch Ed Schultz saw him saying Republicans were the party of death for opposing health care reform. “The Republicans lie! They want to see you dead! They’d rather make money off your dead corpse!”                
                

            
                The so-called professional journalists on the broadcast networks weren’t much better. While sleazy Democrats were contemplating passing health care reform without ever even voting on it, the evening news shows were largely silent. The bogus claim that the government can seize one-sixth of the economy through “deem and pass” received little coverage, let alone scrutiny. Imagine if the GOP had tried to ram through a similar controversial law. The media would have filled the airwaves with concerned citizens, experts and advocates. Since Democrats are embracing the corruption, it’s just a blip in the coverage.                
                

            
                The broadcast networks were just as weak on facts. Last year, an analysis of network coverage showed less than one story in 10 included accurate cost estimates for health care reform.                
                

            
                And journalists repeatedly got the scope of the problem wrong. Before Obama changed his claim about the number of uninsured Americans, networks parroted the bogus figure 80 percent of the time. ABC’s Robin Roberts was typical when she told “Good Morning America” viewers that “50 million Americans” were uninsured. Her claim was wrong by at least 14 million people. But when Obama downgraded his number during a September speech, most of the media fell into line.                
                

            
                That was the real story of health care reform. No matter what Obama and the Democrats did, it was right. Anything to pass health care reform.                
                

            
                For today, the left and their media allies have won the fight. But Democrats will have to pay in November and beyond.

Democrats' Blame Game Keeps Backfiring,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                A leading House Democrat has been following me around for days. OK, not literally - but his words have stuck in my head and I can't shake them loose.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Last week, just before leaving on a month-long recess, Rep. Van Hollen (D-MD) declared, with much indignation and more than a twinge of bitterness, that they would not let the health care reform debate be ""swiftboated.""                
                

            
                That makes for a nice sound bite that appeals to the party's left wing but irritates most of America. And therein lies the Democrats' problem with getting more people to back their  health care effort.  When questioned on the merits of their proposal, they fall back on what makes them most comfortable-- appealing to the far left of their party.  But this comes at the expense of everyone else -- they have consistently ignored the legitimate questions of the vast majority of the population, preferring to duck the tough questions and instead to make others the bad guy.                
                

            
                Now that they control every office in Washington, the burden is theirs to inspire and lead on major reforms they want to pass.  And yet they seem to get so offended when someone wants to know how the legislation will affect them and their families.                
                

            
                There are some basic questions they need to answer if they're to get support: People want to know how the bill will change their own health care coverage, how much it is really going to cost, and what the benefits will be for them.                
                

            
                No one expects the Democrats to have a crystal ball, but they do expect them to have some basic answers.  With something as big as changing a system that makes up 18 percent of our economy, it's hard to be precise-- because no one really knows exactly how it will unfold.                
                

            
                The most concrete answers, unfortunately for the Democrats, have come from the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO warns that the House bill will cost over $1 trillion dollars for the first ten years, that it will only cover a fraction of the uninsured, and that taxes are likely to be raised across the board.                
                

            
                Those bombshells sounded an alarm across the country.  Instead of being comforted, Americans became uneasy.  They started showing up in droves at town hall meetings, calling their Congressman, paying more attention to the debate, and raising more questions.                
                

            
                Instead of trying to answer the questions on the merits, many Democrats lashed out at anyone who dared suggest the proposal wasn't ready for prime time.  They started blaming others for their predicament.                
                

            
                At first they blamed the Republicans as a party for being against reform, but the facts don't support their arguments.  Especially because it was many concerned Democrats who were raising a ruckus, too.  They had to find a new villain.                
                

            
                They pointed fingers at conservative talk radio show hosts and said they were scaring people, but the Democrats can't convincingly answer any of the questions they raise. That's not the hosts fault -- they aren't the ones charged with providing the answers.                
                

            
                Incredibly this past week, the Democrats found a new entity to blame -- the mainstream media.  They said that it was journalists that created a ""false deadline"" of passing a bill by August. But the tapes of themselves pushing for August results embarrassed them and so that went nowhere either.                
                

            
                Now it seems they've settled on targeting the insurance companies-- probably not a bad idea politically, but it will be interesting to see if the insurance companies continue to let themselves be vilified. I'd love to be a fly on the wall the next time Pelosi and Reid place fundraising calls to the insurance company executives. I'll bet the companies won't stand up for themselves very much thinking that this is the price they have to pay to stay in business on Capitol Hill.                
                

            
                After a month of incessant finger pointing, there is one thing everyone agrees on. This topic will dominate in the districts during August. Tons of money will be spent-- ironically, it could help stimulate the economy more so than any not-so-shovel ready transportation projects or the cash for clunkers bill.                
                

            
                The responsibility lies with the Democrats to use this time to make their case from health care reform on the merits. I suspect they won't be able to do that-- and I wonder who'll be their next villain. They're running out of targets and ultimately will have no one to blame but themselves when the bill fails.

"Palin Makes Dems Cry ""Uncle"" On Death Panels","AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                On a Facebook post, former Gov. Sarah Palin puts the lie to The New York Times' assertion that ""the rumor that government-sponsored 'death panels' to decide which patients were worthy of living seemed to arise from nowhere"" (emphasis added by The Stiletto).                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Had Times reporters Jim Rutenberg and Jackie Calmes read her commentary -- which was posted the day before their article was published -- they would have known that the death panels are real, and where to read up on the details. Palin makes a solid case that health care ""reform,"" as originally envisioned by Democrats, would lead to rationed care and put a price tag on the value of people's lives based on their economic productivity.                
                

            
                Palin cites and explains the ramifications of Section 1233 (""Advance Care Planning Consultation,"" pages 424 to 434) of the House's proposed bill, ""America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009,'' and quotes from ""Principles For Allocation Of Scarce Medical Interventions"" (The Lancet, January 31, 2009), a paper co-authored by one of President Obama's health care policy advisors, Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel -- whose brother, Rahm, is the president's chief of staff.                
                

            
                Dr. Emanuel, a bioethicist, believes that doctors and hospitals should apply a rationing scheme he calls ""complete life"" for such medical services as ICU beds, heart transplants and vaccines during a flu pandemic. Under this scheme, adolescents and young adults would get priority over infants and the elderly, because ""they have received substantial education and parental care, investments that will be wasted without a complete life. Infants -- have not yet received these investments.""                
                

            
                Though the paper's authors admit that their scheme is ageist, they do not even bother to discuss exceptions to their hierarchical valuation of human life. For instance, is the average 14-year old more ""valuable"" to society than, say, Pablo Picasso in his later years? Objectively, no -- but (s)he is valuable to a circle of family and friends, and that should be enough. Ditto Grandma, even if she isn't in Picasso's league as a world renowned artist. And so is -- too bad it doesn't go without saying -- Trig Palin. But try convincing Dr. Emanuel's fellow bioethicist, Peter Singer, who believes that the lives of animals deserve more protection than the lives of people (see second item in this link).                
                

            
                Believe it or not, the rationing scheme Dr. Emanuel advocates in The Lancet is a softening of his views on which lives are worth saving. Though Palin was mocked -- surprise! -- for her ""death panel"" analysis, it's now Dr. Emanuel who is backpedaling from an article he co-authored 13 years ago, The Washington Times reports:                
                

            
                ""When I began working in the health policy area about 20 years ago ... I thought we would definitely have to ration care, that there was a need to make a decision and deny people care,"" said Dr. Emanuel ... during a phone interview. ...                
                

            
                He wrote [in a short article published in a bioethics journal in 1996] that ""services provided to individuals who are irreversibly prevented from being or becoming participating citizens are not basic and should not be guaranteed.""                
                

            
                ""An obvious example is not guaranteeing health services to patients with dementia,"" he wrote in the paper published by The Hastings Center, a nonpartisan, non-profit bioethics research institute. ...                
                

            
                The charges of rationing, or concerns about his language in journal articles, Dr. Emanuel said, is somewhat understandable given that he was ""writing really for political philosophers, and for the average person it's not what they're used to reading, even if they've had a good liberal education.""                
                

            
                Palin can also put another notch on her belt when it comes to influencing health care ""reform"" -- the Senate will drop language ""encouraging"" doctors to initiate conversations with patients about hospice and palliative end-of-life care from its bill, The Boston Globe reports:                
                

            
                Senator Chuck Grassley, the Senate Finance Committee's top Republican and one of six committee members trying to hash out a bipartisan bill, said yesterday that the provision could be misinterpreted and that it will not be contained in the committee's proposed legislation. ...                
                

            
                Yesterday, Grassley criticized the House bill, saying there was a difference between a ""simple education campaign, as some advocates want,'' and paying ""physicians to advise patients about end-of-life care'' and rating doctors ""based on the creation of and adherence to orders for end-of-life care.''
                
                

            
                Public support for Obamacare and Congressional Dems has fallen another five points from just two weeks ago, with just 42 percent of U.S. voters now in favor, according to a nationwide Rasmussen telephone survey. Oh, and voters now trust Republicans more  than Democrats now on health care (44 percent to 41 percent).                
                

            
                Palin was hardly the only one to look at the House bill and realize its implications. In a commentary posted on The Daily Beast, ""thinker"" Lee Siegel -- who believes ""the absence of universal health care is America's burning shame"" -- calls rationing end-of-life care ""morally revolting"":                
                

            
                Determining which treatments are ""cost effective"" at the end of a person's life and which are not is one of Obama's priorities. It's one of the principal ways he counts on saving money and making universal health care affordable.                
                

            
                This is the Big Brother nightmare of oppressive government that the shrewd propagandists on the right are always blathering on about. Except that this time, they could not be more right. ...                
                

            
                [T]he argument that fruitless tests and ""senseless"" procedures are bankrupting the health care system, that is an insult to the intelligence. No one knows which tests and procedures will be effective beforehand. No amount of ""study"" and research is going to address the particular case and the particular condition, let alone the particular, desperate, irrational will to live -- which, in animal terms, is pragmatic and rational.                
                

            
                The Stiletto seems to recall pundits across the political spectrum writing Palin off as irrelevant after she voluntarily stepped down from public office in July. Guess they were -- what is the word? -- wrong."
Recessions and the presidents who inherited them,"Jan. 20, 2009: President Obama escorts former President Bush to a waiting helicopter behind the U.S. Capitol after Obama's inauguration ceremony in Washington.
	                        
	                        	 (Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Three of the last six U.S. presidents have inherited a recessionary economy: Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Let’s define “inheriting a recession” as meaning that on the date a president is sworn into office, the economy is technically still in recession or enters one within a few months.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Most economists would agree that presidents have little short-term control over the economy, but that their fiscal policies can be implemented quickly and affect macroeconomic performance after the first year.                 
                

            
                Reagan, inaugurated in January 1981, actually endured a double-dip recession—one that had been raging since early 1980 and a second that hit in July 1981—but the economy experienced a strong and sustained recovery that began in November 1982 during his second year in the White House.                 
                

            
                Bush was inaugurated in January 2001, and the economy entered recession just weeks later.                
                

            
                Obama entered office in January 2009, like Reagan, after the United States had been in recession for a full year.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                All three men could fairly claim they “inherited” a recession as well as fundamental economic problems. Reagan took over a nation experiencing double digit inflation and double digit interest rates. Bush took over an economy with a manufacturing sector in freefall and a crashed dot-com financial bubble. Months later, the nation was attacked on 9/11 and Wall Street was literally smoldering for months. Obama faced a financial crisis stemming from a burst real estate bubble.                
                

            
                However, the policy responses of the three presidents and economic results were markedly different. Reagan faced a divided Congress, whereas Bush and Obama enjoyed unified partisan control over Congress during their first 24 months in office.                
                

            
                Ronald Reagan worked with Democratic majorities in Congress to reform the US tax code and bring down the top marginal rate from 70 to 50 percent in 1981, then further to 28.5 percent in 1986.                 
                

            
                George Bush oversaw tax reforms that cut rates across the board in 2001, which were accelerated in 2003.                 
                

            
                Barack Obama maintained the income tax structure in place by default, but has worked tirelessly to raise top marginal rates. His signature domestic policy achievements were a near-trillion dollar stimulus (debt financed federal government expenditures) and major health care reform (which includes significant tax increases).                
                

            
                The Jobs Impact                
                

            
                The labor market is a coincident variable that moves up and down in tandem with the business cycle. When the economy is in recession, the labor market moves in lock step. Companies are reluctant to hire, jobless claims spike, and workers are often discouraged enough to leave the labor force.                 
                

            
                The unemployment rate is a demographically neutral measure of labor strength, unlike the count of payroll jobs which is sensitive to immigration and the age of the workforce. However, unemployment does not capture the effect of severe workforce discouragement.                 
                

            
                For a truly neutral metric, economists look at the ratio of total employment to total population, known as ""E-Pop.""                
                

            
                A historical look at the E-Pop is shown in Figure 1. Since 1990, E-Pop never fell below the 61 percent level until March of 2009. It hovered around 63 percent for two decades until the 2008 shock. The E-pop ratio dropped 4.5 percentage points during the recession, and has not recovered at all in the years since. During the Obama administration, the E-Pop ratio has been stuck between 58 and 59 percent.                
                

            
                To put the time series in context, Figure 2 shows the E-Pop’s movement before and after a common zero reference point for the six major recessions since 1970.                 
                

            
                The typical E-Pop pattern in previous recessionary cycles is actually remarkably steady compared to the random movements often observed in most other economic data. Specifically, the E-pop cycle has normally been a 1.5 to 3 percentage point decline over the first 24-months that recovers to normal at the 48-month point.                 
                

            
                There has been literally no recovery during the Obama administration, now 54 months after the recession began. The net decline of 4.5 percentage points is indeed unprecedented, but the fact that E-pop remains 4.0 points below its recent high is astounding. Each percentage point equals roughly 3 million U.S. jobs, meaning the economy is over 12 million jobs below potential.                
                

            
                The historical record shows that recessions are often inherited. All presidents face different challenges with unique headwinds and tailwinds.                 
                

            
                The severity of the 2007-2009 recession was uniquely large. On the other hand, no president enjoyed the tailwind of loose monetary policy during the same period on the scale provided by Bernanke’s Federal Reserve, nor the massive debt-financed government stimulus that continues to this day.                 
                

            
                As for unique challenges, no presidents aside from Franklin Roosevelt and George Bush suffered attacks on American soil like Pearl Harbor and 9/11.                 
                

            
                Certainly the current Federal Reserve’s supportive policies are a sharp contrast with the high interest rates Reagan faced.                 
                

            
                As for policy actions, no other president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 responded to a recession by raising taxes as aggressively as Obama.                 
                

            
                The results to date confirm that the high-tax, high-spend policy approach is failing to generate a real recovery, and worse, has created a new normal that is 12 million jobs below the old normal.

Obama's Health Care Poison Pill,"In his crusade to bring health care - one-sixth of the country's economy - under government control, President Obama is asking Americans to swallow a huge and potentially poisonous policy pill.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Just as many Canadian politicians and their families have, hypocritically, come to the U.S. when they prefer our advanced, private health care over their own socialized system, President Obama got caught last night in a ""do as I say not as I do"" moment. In a special broadcast on ABC, the president refused to pledge that he'd limit his own family to the tests and treatments that the general public would have to confine themselves to under his proposed health care ""public option"" restrictions.                
                

            
                Obama dismisses as ""fear tactics"" charges that his program amounts to ""socialized medicine"" similar to Canada, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Yet, ironically, Canada, the United Kingdom and Sweden are all beginning to open their socialized systems to private care due to citizen protests that critical treatments are delayed or denied. The past president of the Canadian Medical Association says that in Canada, ""Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦a dog can get a hip replaced in under a week but a human may wait two to three years.""                
                

            
                None of this deters Obama from his insistence on government-run health care. And while he bases the need for reform on cost savings and universal coverage, the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that Obamacare would increase the federal deficit by more than $1.6-trillion over ten years even while leaving 30 million people uninsured.                
                

            
                This week, Obama is leading a charge to use Democrats to ram through draft health reform legislation in the Senate, excluding Republican input. Obama's rush to pass health care reform by August 1 is the centerpiece of his plan to do a ""community reorganization"" of America by putting more of the private sector under government control and tying the middle class to government with the major entitlement of health insurance.                
                

            
                But according to Michael Cannon, writing in National Review, ""there aren't enough Americans earning more than $250,000 to finance [Obamacare] reform would mean higher taxes for the middle class, violating another promise Obama made during the presidential campaign."" Further, ""if Congress used Medicare's payment rates and opened the new program to everyone, it could pull 120 million Americans out of private insurance more than half of the private market"" and boost the government rolls by an even larger number. Two-thirds of Americans would depend on government for their health care, compared with just over one-quarter today. That would strike a historic blow against even the possibility of limited government.""                
                

            
                The public's worries are growing about Obama's overreach. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll finds that ""Most respondents are 'very concerned' that health-care reform would lead to higher costs, lower quality, fewer choices, a bigger deficit, diminished insurance coverage and more government bureaucracy."" When those polled find out that government-funded health care could put many private insurers out of business because of an inability to compete with Uncle Sam, support for government control sinks to 37 percent.                
                

            
                Medicare and Medicaid illustrate the potential for Obamacare to bankrupt individual states en route to bankrupting the nation and transforming the country into a welfare continent like Europe. Medicare and Medicaid waste, fraud, mismanagement and runaway costs threaten the financial viability of many states, including California and New York. Just as with Obamacare, Medicare and Medicaid use ostensible cost controls mandated by Big Government. But the result has been that patients, hospitals, doctors, pharmaceutical companies and the government itself game the crazy incentives of the system to overuse and overprescribe medicine while stifling more cost efficiency and innovation in medical care.                
                

            
                Obama is selling his health care plan as a way to reform all that. But what he's not telling you is that the price you'll pay (when you're not paying it in higher taxes) includes rationing: of medical procedures, patient-doctor choices, and access to cutting edge new drug"" which will all be restricted by government bureaucrats.                
                

            
                Contrary to Obama (and his echo chamber in the mainstream news media), there are alternative health care plans that can be emulated -- using the private economy. In the June 19 Wall Street Journal, Kimberly Strassel wrote about tens of thousands of Safeway employees enjoying quality, cost-effective health care in a program championed by CEO Steve Burd who ""blew up the company's existing health care structure and replaced it with one that embodied market principles -- choice, responsibility, competition and price.""                
                

            
                The FOX Forum and others, including the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, are providing outlets for citizens to debate what kind of health care they prefer.                
                

            
                The antidote of public scrutiny is needed. Otherwise, Obama's health care poison pill could kill the private system that makes American medicine the world's best.

"SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER: Please, Mr. President, Listen to the People","AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                In my opening remarks on behalf of Republicans at the White House health care summit on Feb. 25, I said that millions of Americans under the Democratic plan would pay higher individual insurance premiums. The president said I was wrong. I then cited a Congressional Budget Office report on the Senate passed bill , and rather than dispute the president of the United States in public, I decided to send him a letter explaining my claim, which I did the same day.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In my letter to the president, I pointed out that under the president’s health insurance plan, which mirrors the Senate’s bill, millions of Americans’ individual premiums would go up, because of many reasons, including one-size-fits-all government mandates and taxes that are passed on to consumers. Further, when you dump 15 to 18 million people into a program called Medicaid, which doesn’t pay the doctors and the hospitals well enough to take care of these individuals, then the hospitals will shift the costs onto people with private insurance. In other words, their private premiums will go up. Also, premium costs for young people will go up under this plan, because if you put in a rule that says my insurance at my age can only be a certain amount higher than my son’s insurance, then his insurer will charge him more to make up the difference. Finally, a scheme like the Democratic plan depends upon requiring everybody to buy insurance, but their penalty to encourage that is weak, and I suspect many young and/or healthy people would just rather pay the $750 fine rather than buy the $2,500 insurance policy, which they can’t afford.                
                

            
                The president made the point in his usual, persuasive way that, even if your insurance costs more, you’d be getting better insurance. But as columnist George Will said on ABC’s “This Week” last Sunday, “If the government required you to buy a better, more expensive car, even if it was better than the car you’ve got, it would still be more expensive.” And that’s the case with the president’s health care plan.                
                

            
                In fact, individual premiums will go up for millions of Americans who buy individual policies—even more than they otherwise would over the next several years, and we all know how rapidly they’re rising. The whole exercise that we’ve been going through over the last year with health care reform was supposed to bring premiums down—not help drive premiums up.                
                

            
                Common sense tells us that if you tax an insurance company or a medical device company or a manufacturer of drugs, they’ll pass the taxes on to whom? The answer is: to us -- the people who are buying the insurance policies, or medical devices or drugs. In fact, the president’s proposal does just that.                
                

            
                His plan has a 40% excise tax on high-cost private insurance plans which we call “Cadillac Plans.” Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, on February 24, said that a 40% excise tax will raise $7 billion, almost all of which will be passed along to consumers in the form of higher insurance premiums.                
                

            
                And there are other taxes in the president’s proposal—up to half a trillion dollars in new taxes, which will be passed on to consumers: $20 billion on excise taxes on lifesaving medical devices, $33 billion on drugs, $60 billion on health insurance companies.                
                

            
                The American people have tried to say in every way they know how to say that they don't want this bill – through the elections in New Jersey, Virginia, and Massachusetts; through surveys and townhalls – that they would like us to start over. If we do that, we can write a good health care bill – one that sets as its goal reducing – not increasing – costs, both to individuals and to their government. It means putting aside this idea of jamming the Senate Democrats’ bill through the House with a legislative gimmick. And it means going step by step together to re-earn the trust of the American people.

                This is not a scientific poll."
Journalists Have Bad Case of 'Americaphobia',"To most Americans, the battle over the Ground Zero mosque is about honoring the victims of 9/11. To those in the news media, the numbers tell a different story.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                For weeks on end, news outlets have parroted the most left-wing talking points – crying “racism” or “Islamophobia” in an attempt to paint mosque opponents as bigots. The media’s attack on Americans who still remember what happened on Sept. 11 2001, could be called a crusade. But that word that makes you a pro-Western bigot in their eyes.                
                

            
                So let’s call it what it is – jihad. An out-and-out pro-Islamist assault on American values. In a term they might understand, it’s Americaphobia.                
                

            
                And it’s failing miserably. The numbers tell the tale better than most network journalists. A Time magazine poll from Aug. 16-17 showed 61 percent of Americans nationwide still oppose this mosque despite the best efforts of the Washington elites of all three major political parties – Democrats, Republicans and Journalists.
And even that poll question has more spin than the top in the movie “Inception.” Here it is: “Overall, do you favor or oppose the building of the Muslim community center and mosque near where the World Trade Center stood?"" That certainly embraces the media viewpoint – however inaccurate – that it’s more “community center” than mosque.                
                

            
                Every church I’ve ever attended has had numerous facilities – schools and gyms and cafeterias and more. Yet every one of them was called one thing – a church. Sure, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf might try to model his mosque on the Jewish Community Center, but that isn’t the issue. The mosque is.                
                

            
                It’s an issue that resonates with a huge chunk of Americans from all walks of life – right wing, left wing, Christian and Muslim. The only group that doesn’t believe it’s an issue is journalists. So they twist and manipulate the story in dozens of ways so it turns out their way.                
                

            
                Only it hasn’t. The unseen hand of journalism manipulating American democracy is no longer unseen, nor is it as effective as it once was. But that hasn’t stopped the media from trying its best.                
                

            
                The Associated Press “Standards Center” issued a “staff advisory on covering New York City mosque” on Aug. 19 as just one piece of that spin. “We should continue to avoid the phrase ‘ground zero mosque’ or ‘mosque at ground zero’ on all platforms.”                
                

            
                Since that spin memo, finding the term “Ground Zero Mosque” on network news is all but impossible. Before the memo came out, journalists like ABC’s David Kerley were allowed to use it. On Aug. 15, there was Kerley talking about Obama “trying to steer through the treacherous waters of the Ground Zero Mosque” debate. “Early Today” host Lynn Berry talked about the “Ground Zero Mosque controversy.” Other reporters echoed the term.                
                

            
                But AP had to choose sides. To the great spinmeisters in that organization, a building near the World Trade Center that was actually damaged in the attack isn’t at Ground Zero. Had AP headquarters been in that building, you can bet they would have covered their own damage like it had been Ground Zero. It’s the terminology game reporters and editors play. Lefty terms like “pro-choice” are OK, but don’t dare say “pro-life.” Conservatives can be “far right” but try finding liberals who are “far left.”                
                

            
                That’s just one of the games journalists play. They can’t claim the mosque opposition is “bigoted” if Muslims oppose it as well, so those voices are almost never heard on network broadcasts. In the past month, ABC, CBS and NBC evening news shows intereviewed Muslims 10 times for their mosque stories. Nine of those interviewed supported the mosque. Only one Muslim opponent was quoted. Other critics, such as the first Muslim Miss USA and the director of Al-Arabiya, a popular Arab-language news station, were ignored. They would have interfered with the prearranged news agenda. So would showing the hateful person who cursed out an anti-mosque protester who had survived the Holocaust.                
                

            
                That’s a consistent theme. The controversial imam who is pushing the project, Feisal Abdul Rauf, is a “moderate” who wants only peace and even “eulogized Daniel Pearl.” His questionable funding, a refusal to call Hamas a terror group and his many controversial statements largely get a pass in the “news media.” Remember, this is the man who said: “the United States has more Muslim blood on its hands than Al Qaeda has on its hands of innocent non-Muslims.”                
                

            
                If Rauf were a tea party supporter and blasting Obama, his views would lead the evening news.                
                

            
                Thankfully, fewer and fewer people care about the spin. While journalists go one way with their coverage, Americans are going another – to the exits. Just last week, the Big Three broadcast networks recorded less than 19 million viewers. CBS “Evening News” was watched by less than 5 million people. Yes, some have turned to those shows on the Internet. More often, they have simply been turned off by them.                
                

            
                That is the state of American journalism. No matter what issue is seizing the news – racism, the stimulus, health care reform, tea parties, the Ground Zero Mosque and more – journalists pick the most liberal side. It’s a sad reality that at the upper levels of journalism, they simply don’t like the America that many others love. Finally, America is returning the sentiment.

"Obama Stimulates Big Business Allies, Not the Economy","Last week’s disappointing Labor Department employment report is a stark reminder of the failure of President Obama’s $787 billion economic stimulus package to initiate job growth. The national unemployment rate remains at a stubbornly high 9.6 percent, with payrolls falling by 95,000.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                However, the failure of Obama’s economic recovery plan to keep unemployment at or below 8 percent has not deterred the president from using stimulus funds to drive his green economy fantasy. On the contrary: During a recent radio address, Obama touted his recovery plan is plowing over $90 billion of taxpayer money into clean energy projects.                
                

            
                While these funds have failed to stimulate job growth and kick-start economic expansion, they have bailed out Obama’s big-business allies, who are betting on the president’s green agenda. Dolling out stimulus money to corporate interests serves a key political need for Obama: it rewards companies for lobbying for his energy policy.                
                

            
                Despite all the rhetoric of Obama’s anti-business leanings, visible when he speaks of energy policy just as with health care reform, the president has carefully tailored his legislative goals to appeal to corporate special interests.                
                

            
                Consequently, it’s not surprising to discover that many of the remaining corporate members of the United States Climate Action Partnership cap-and-trade lobbying group, including General Electric, Duke Energy, NextEra Energy, Exelon, and Honeywell, all received economic stimulus funds.                
                

            
                These companies have banked on a federal law, like Obama’s, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.                
                

            
                General Electric is perhaps the company reaping the most from Obama’s stimulus plan. As noted in a 2009 Wall Street Journal story, “General Electric Pursues Pot of Government Stimulus Gold,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt geared up his lobbying army to exploit President Obama’s economic stimulus package.                
                

            
                According to Recovery.gov, GE is the beneficiary of over $49 million in grants and contracts from a wide range of government departments, including Energy, Defense, Justice and Health and Human Services.                
                

            
                Taxpayer support of GE’s business, however, is not guaranteed to translate into job gains.                
                

            
                CNSNews.com tried to confirm that GE was the recipient of 14 grants worth $24.9 million and to determine if the company added employees as a result of taxpayer money. GE declined to comment on the request.                
                

            
                Although GE apparently will happily feed from the taxpayer trough from any government source, it seeks its biggest payout from Obama’s energy policy.                
                

            
                GE will profit from the Department of Energy’s recently announced plan to guarantee a $1.3 billion loan for the world’s largest wind farm. If finalized, the loan would support the Caithness Shepherds Flat wind venture in Oregon, a project co-sponsored by GE.                
                

            
                In announcing the plan, U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu credited the Recovery Act for supporting the loan program. The wind farm project will use 338 wind turbines supplied by GE.                
                

            
                In addition to direct government support of its energy business, GE will likely benefit from the hundreds of millions of dollars that were given to three of GE’s utility customers, Duke Energy, NextEra Energy and Exelon. Each of the aforementioned utility companies received a $200 million grant from the Department of Energy to develop the smart grid.                
                

            
                Although Obama’s energy suffered a setback when cap-and-trade failed to pass in the Senate (so far), the president and his big-business allies have been very resourceful in working their green energy partnership thorough the economic recovery plan. At some point, however, those funds will dry up.                
                

            
                The next target for the Obama/big-business alliance is a renewable energy standard. Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Sam Brownback (R-KS) recently introduced a renewable energy standard bill in the Senate that mandates 15 percent of electricity must be derived from energy sources such as wind and solar power by 2021.                
                

            
                Mandating the use of renewable energy products to generate electricity will boost GE’s profits, since it will force utilities to buy wind and solar power products that the company makes. The renewable energy standard also fits nicely with Obama’s promise to pursue his energy agenda in “chunks.”                
                

            
                Unfortunately, a renewable energy standard will not help our economy or promote long-term job growth.                
                

            
                The experience of countries such as Spain found that a green energy economy falls far short of its goals.                
                

            
                Unless we find a way to break up Obama’s big-business alliance, our economy will be saddled with greater deficits, higher energy prices and slower economic growth. We need to cap bailouts, not carbon emissions.

"DANA PERINO: Republicans Aren't Caving On Finanical Reform, They're Leading","Next week the Senate will start final debate on a financial reform bill. This comes after the Republicans forced the Democrats to relent on some of the provisions that were plainly ridiculous and not well thought out. But that's not what most of the media is saying -- the narrative it has decided on is that Republicans caved in the face of fear over being called ""the party of no."" That's not how I see it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In fact, with 41 votes, Republicans understood that the best opportunity for improving the bill would be through negotiations before it hit the Senate floor (something they tried to do with health care reform but could not do...though now they're getting to say ""I told ya so!"").                
                

            
                The time afforded to Senators McConnell and Shelby by all Senate Republicans and Sen. Nelson (D-Neb.) was pivotal in removing dangerous bailout loopholes that Democrats previously refused to admit existed.                
                

            
                Far from coming up short, the GOP got six key concessions from the Democrats:                
                

            
                - Taxpayers must be protected, not exposed.                
                

            
                - Bailout fund must be removed.                
                

            
                - Failing firms must be allowed to fail - shareholders must be wiped out.                
                

            
                -Creditors of failing firms must pay - anything that exceeds bankruptcy must be recouped.                
                

            
                -Congress must have an upfront say in any guarantee program.                
                

            
                -Emergency programs can only be used in real emergencies and only by healthy (solvent) firms.                
                

            
                Now Senate Republicans will focus on taking out misguided provisions that go beyond Wall Street to interfere with small businesses, community banks, and employers throughout the country that had nothing to do with the financial crisis. That's not caving -- that's legislating.

MICHAEL GOODWIN: The President Is the Problem,"Once again, Barack Obama is a happy pitch man. He's on stage with a microphone, jacket off, sleeves rolled up, his voice rising and falling as he tries to whip the big crowds into revival-tent fervor.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                He's still peddling Hope & Change, although now he calls it health care reform. He swears his miracle elixir will save your life, your money and your country.                
                

            
                It will do anything you could possibly want -- unless you want the truth.                
                

            
                Then you're squat out of luck. See, truth is a pre-existing condition not covered by ObamaCare.
We used to arrest people for selling snake oil. Now we elect them.                
                

            
                ""No false claim left behind"" is the perfect summation of President Obama's last-gasp push for a bill that hasn't even been written. No matter details or cost, it'll cure whatever ails you and America.                
                

            
                He's for it, whatever it ends up saying. Just as he was for the House bill and the Senate bill, both before and after they were written, although they contradicted each other in key ways.
And we have to do it now -- now, for history, before it's too late.                
                

            
                For Obama, it's already too late. The public took a leap of faith on him once, and his expensive potions are making the country sicker. The sell-by date on his promise machine has expired.                
                

            
                He and Nancy Pelosi might browbeat, scare and bribe enough weak-kneed House Democrats to get a party-line majority, but he's already lost something far more important than whether the health takeover squeaks by.                
                

            
                He's lost the ability to inspire trust. Without that, he's a president in name only.                
                

            
                To watch his selling job the last two days, first in Pennsylvania and yesterday near St. Louis, you have to wonder if he fully grasps that the country outside Washington isn't listening anymore. Or maybe he understands, and doesn't care.                
                

            
                Independent voters, especially, have tuned him out, and there is nothing he is saying to make them pay attention again. Quite the opposite.                
                

            
                The more he attacks dissenters and corporations and the more he makes promises too good to be true, the less appealing he is. We like passion in our president, but desperation is unbecoming.                
                

            
                In his second memoir, Obama wrote about his special skill. ""I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views,"" he confessed.                
                

            
                He was too modest, leaving out the part about his excellent talent for playing on people's desires. The combination is key to every good con, and it was key to his election -- he said what much of the country wanted to hear about optimism and restoring a national unity of purpose.                
                

            
                We know now that's not who he is. The country is as divided and demoralized as ever, and the big economic and national security problems are getting the shaft while he plays Ahab, chasing his white whale.                
                

            
                At home and abroad, the administration has veered so far off course that Washington is abuzz over which White House honcho will get the heave-ho. Mutual back-stabbing has begun in earnest.                
                

            
                Fine, let's amuse ourselves with the spectacle of a sacrifice or two. But let's not kid ourselves. The president is the problem.

New ObamaCare taxes are hitting millions where it hurts. It's time to repeal them,"FILE -- 
                                    
                                         (REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman)
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                	
            
        
    

    

								
								



 



       
       
      
          
              Tax reform legislation signed into law by President Trump in December, which will lower taxes for most Americans this year, unfortunately did nothing to stop billions of dollars in new taxes under ObamaCare from hitting millions of Americans in the wallet.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This is because while the tax reform law weakens part of ObamaCare – by basically ending the mandate requiring individuals to buy health insurance coverage – important parts of the health-care law still remain in effect. These include: a big expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health program serving the poor; federal regulations on health insurance markets; and several taxes to finance the health-care law.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Three of the ObamaCare taxes have been targeted for elimination by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers who are concerned about raising the cost of health insurance for so many Americans. While the official name of ObamaCare is the Affordable Care Act, the new taxes harm rather than protect consumers and make health insurance less affordable.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              The ObamaCare taxes being targeted by opponents are: the so-called “Cadillac tax” on some high-value health insurance policies; an excise tax on medical devices; and a 4 to 6 percent tax on some insurance policies when they are sold. While the “Cadillac tax” hasn’t gone into effect, both the health insurance and medical device taxes became effective Jan. 1.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Although Republicans did not create ObamaCare, they are in a golden position to do something about the rising premiums that have resulted.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              The health insurance tax is troubling because it’s paid for directly by consumers, in the form of higher premiums. So millions of us will take a direct hit, even though most people who will be paying for the tax increase don’t even realize it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Lawmakers and President Trump should consider immediately ending the health insurance tax, whether as part of their discussions regarding a spending package for the remainder of 2018 or as part of additional health-care reform efforts.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              In addition to the taxes imposed by ObamaCare, there are a number of factors that influence how much consumers generally pay for health insurance.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For example, the premium is impacted by the specific benefits and health-care providers that are part of the plan. The premium is also affected by the relative health or sickness of others who participate in an insurance plan. Plans that include a larger proportion of sicker beneficiaries overall will be more expensive, while plans with a healthier mix of enrollees are cheaper.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The new health insurance tax applies to so-called “fully-insured” health insurance plans. It will be paid by: consumers who purchase their coverage on the individual market (including ObamaCare’s health insurance exchanges); many employees of small businesses that furnish coverage; and even some people who get their health insurance through large employers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The new health insurance tax also applies to seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plans, as well as low-income Americans in Medicaid managed care plans.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax will raise about $13 billion in revenue in 2018 alone, and about $145 billion over the next 10 years. But these numbers don’t tell the full story of how the health insurance tax impacts families, small businesses and taxpayers across America.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A study last year by Oliver Wyman Health found that the health insurance tax will increase annual health insurance premiums in 2018 by $158 per person in the individual market; about $500 per family for those getting coverage through many small employers and some large employers; and $245 for each Medicare Advantage member.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These increases will accelerate in 2019 and beyond. So over the next 10 years, the study concludes that individual market beneficiaries will pay over $2,000 more in premiums; families getting their coverage through small employers will pay over $6,000 more; and Medicare Advantage members will pay over $3,000 more.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Medicaid managed-care enrollees will see premium increases of $181 in 2018 and an estimated $2,370 over the next 10 years. These costs won’t be borne by the low-income beneficiaries of the program. Instead, states and their taxpayers will foot the bill.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As insurance premiums rise – in part because of the health insurance tax – healthier consumers are more likely to forego health insurance. This concept, known as adverse selection, will leave only sicker consumers – particularly in the individual and small-group marketplaces.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              With a higher proportion of sicker individuals on health insurance rolls, the cost of an insurance policy will become even more unaffordable. The effective elimination of the individual mandate to purchase health insurance could actually worsen this trend. This is because there will be even less economic incentive for healthy consumers, in particular, to buy coverage. This will tend to boost premiums even more for those who are sicker or need health insurance coverage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Republicans, then, have both a policy and political imperative to get rid of ObamaCare’s health insurance tax. While the tax certainly isn’t the only reason that many consumers are experiencing higher premiums this year, it is an important factor.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Although Republicans did not create ObamaCare, they are in a golden position to do something about the rising premiums that have resulted. A failure to do so may hurt congressional Republicans when they come before the voters in this November’s midterm elections. And that’s a risk they shouldn’t take.

The tax reform flip-flop Trump desperately needs to make,"Now Playing                            Where the Trump administration stands on health care                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Trump and the Republican Congressional leadership are following the lead of their rank and file. They are making their first priority the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare. That is a mistake. Health care reform is complicated. Arriving at a replacement plan will not happen quickly or easily.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Meanwhile, the Trump administration is beginning at a time when fourth quarter 2016 GDP growth, despite predictions of a robust outcome, came in at a tepid 1.9 percent. If the economy over the next nine months weakens significantly, be assured replacing Obamacare with a new plan supported by 60 senators, including eight Democrats, will be even more difficult.                
                

            
                Under the current proposed legislative agenda, Congress will not be able to take up the issue of tax reform until members of Congress get a firm picture of a replacement health care plan. That plan, which cannot be passed under the 51-vote majority reconciliation vehicle, but instead will require 60 votes, could take longer than expected to develop. During the next several months, the Senate will also be tied up in debate over the President’s Supreme Court nominee. Usually that process takes several months of debate and backroom maneuvering before a candidate is confirmed. The Senate becomes bogged down.                
                

            
                The point here is that financial markets are assuming that Congress will easily enact a tax reform package, including the immediate expensing for tax purposes of all capital investment and some form of border adjustment tax, by late summer at the latest.                 
                

            
                The prospect for tax reform is one reason the U.S. stock market has surged since the election. The more that ObamaCare replacement and the Supreme Court debate drag on through the rest of this year, the greater the chance that markets conclude that despite the Republican majorities and a Republican White House, legislative stalemate will continue well into 2018 if not longer.                
                

            
                For the GOP, the smarter strategy would be to immediately push tax reform under the first budget reconciliation vehicle. No, tax reform won’t be easy either. But the Democrats have far more emotional attachment to ObamaCare and the chances of outright partisan warfare over tax reform are relatively small.                 
                

            
                True, there will be opposition to the border adjustment tax, particularly from retailers. And those who suggest that the tax reform package not include individual tax reform are misreading the situation. Today 80 percent of businesses are so-called “pass-through” entities that are exempt from the corporate tax system. Any tax reform would have to include these smaller “corporate” entities -- i.e. it would have to include reform of the individual tax code in addition to the corporate tax code.                
                

            
                Capitol Hill moves at a snail’s pace. In the successful 1986 tax reform effort, legislators spent several years prior to enactment ironing out difficulties over thorny issues. Today’s tax reform will entail the same process of negotiations, albeit compressed timewise. The chances, nevertheless, that Congressional Republicans, with some Senate Democratic help, come together with 51 votes by the August 2017 Congressional recess and enact a package are hardly certain. But they are a lot better than the chances that Obamacare is passed through the Senate easily with 60 votes by that time.                
                

            
                The stakes for financial markets are high. If there is a chance tax reform and expensing are not be enacted until some unspecified time in the future, how does a company make a decision on new capital investment? Hold off investing this year in anticipation of much more favorable tax treatment in the future? But such delay could come at a cost to the economy and equity market. Under a border adjustment tax, exports would not be taxed. Should a corporation hold up on its exports until some unspecified future date to achieve tax savings? But such a delay would increase the trade deficit and harm the economy.                
                

            
                For Trump and the Republicans, the money play is to build a more robust economy quickly. With the credibility of such an achievement, ObamaCare, by then hanging by a thread, will become the responsibility of both parties in Congress. The program, even before enactment of a replacement, will likely have died its own death.                 
                

            
                For the first time in decades, both parties in this crisis environment will have to come together in agreement on something they hate -- a bipartisan solution.

The Left Lowers Itself to Name Calling,"Left wing Democrats from New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd to former President Jimmy Carter are chiming in to proclaim that critics of President Obama’s policies are racists. Those making such unsubstantiated claims are revealing that they have no substantive response to the arguments of the critics and so are just resorting to name-calling.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                 
                

            
                President Obama’s left wing allies have become increasingly hysterical after the president’s nationally televised address last Wednesday to a Joint Session of Congress failed to ignite increased public support for his proposed government takeover of health care.  The most recent polls show still increasing majorities opposing the president’s plan.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                In my American Spectator column yesterday at  I explain how the president's address last Wednesday was filled with numerous misleading falsehoods. Over the past couple of days The Wall Street Journal and others have documented further false and misleading statements in that speech.  But instead of responding substantively to these criticisms, President Obama’s allies have resorted to slandering all the critics as racists.  The deceptive campaign for the health overhaul and the non-substantive name-calling response to critics is only further alienating public majorities, as the polls show.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                We see the exact same problem on other issues, such as global warming and proposed cap-and- trade legislation to counter it.  The advocates of man-caused global warming and cap-and-trade have already admitted that they can’t defend their positions in debate.  But they continue to advocate their positions with name calling and sneering at opponents.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                At the same time, we see evidence of inappropriate racial considerations in the policies of the Obama administration. Career prosecutors at the Justice Department brought charges against a unit of the Black Panthers after they engaged in egregious voter intimidation tactics during the 2008 elections -- displaying weapons and insulting white voters.  But even after these prosecutors had won in court, the Obama Justice Department dropped all charges.                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Similarly, after a crowd of black students severely beat a white student on a school bus in Belleville, Mo. a couple of days ago, the Obama Justice Department has shown no interest in opening an investigation.  As The National Review commented yesterday:                 
                

            
                                 
                

            
                “If the races were reversed, there is no doubt that the Civil Rights Division under Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King would already have issued a press release about its intent to probe the beating and pursue a possible hate-crimes prosecution under 18 U.S.C. §245.”

JUAN WILLIAMS: What You Need to Know About the First GOP Debate -- And What I Need From You,"What a week for politics. Usama bin Laden is dead. Even the president’s boldest Republican critics – read that as former Vice President Cheney – have expressed admiration for the Obama administration’s ability to locate and kill America’s number one enemy.

                But the 2012 presidential campaign is already underway with a field of Republican candidates taking shape. And that is where your faithful Fox News political analyst needs your help. I want you to send me questions for the candidates who will be on stage for the first debate of the GOP primary season.                
                

            
                The debate will be on the Fox News Channel this Thursday night, May 5 at 9 p.m. E.T.                
                

            
                I, along with my colleagues Bret Bair, Chris Wallace and Shannon Bream, will be quizzing the GOP candidates on a wide range of foreign and domestic policy issues. As the first round in the fight for the nomination this meeting will set the tone for the rest of the campaign. The primary field is having a hard time taking shape despite the fact that 80 percent of Republicans disapprove of President Obama’s performance in office.                
                

            
                So, I am asking for you to come up with the sharpest questions. Please send them to: foxforum@foxnews.com.
As you think about those questions, as a public service from your Fox News political analyst, here is all you need to know – your official scorecard.                
                

            
                Number one, don’t be fooled by the line-up. All the players will not be on the field Thursday. First here’s a list of the candidates who will be suiting up and appearing on the field: Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and Gary Johnson.                 
                

            
                One unique aspect of this debate is that for millions of Americans, even the most ardent Republicans, it will be the first time they have seen or heard these candidates.                
                

            
                Pawlenty will be the most plausible candidate for the nomination on stage Thrusday night. The former Minnesota governor’s calm and reasoned demeanor will set him apart from the far-right firebrands who will be on stage. His biggest challenge will be to resist the temptation to be pulled too far to the right.                 
                

            
                Santorum, Paul and Cain will undoubtedly be throwing rhetorical red meat to the South Carolina audience. Pawlenty has never shown the ability to compete with any of them as a performer and a showman. His strength is a good record of conservative policies from his tenure as governor of Minnesota. If he simply gives direct answers to the questions and does not get drawn into the contest for who can be the most outrageous conservative provocateur, it might be enough to make him a winner.                
                

            
                For the other four candidates on the stage the big debate is their best chance so far to make a winning impression on GOP voters. One of them could have a very big night and become the leader of the pack.                 
                

            
                GOP primary voters tend to be more conservative just as Democratic primary voters tend to be more liberal. Rick Santorum, Herman Cain, Ron Paul, Gary Johnson and Buddy Roemer are generally far to the right and wildcards. Their unabashed rhetoric might spark an Internet sensation and appeal to the voters who are want a GOP nominee who is the antithesis of politics as usual.                
                

            
                But will the lesser-known candidates know how to handle foreign policy questions? Can they demonstrate knowledge of economic issues? Send in those questions.                
                

            
                Now, here’s a list of candidates who will not be appearing on Thursday night: Michelle Bachmann, Mitch Daniels, Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin all will not be attending. Bachmann, Gingrich and Romney have been clear about their interest in pursuing the nomination. Daniels, Huckabee, Palin and Trump have been clearly hesitant to officially jump into the fray.                
                

            
                It’s my belief that Romney, the biggest star in the group, is not coming because he wants the Republican faithful, especially people with big money, to come to him out of frustration with a mediocre field and give him the nomination by acclamation.                
                

            
                But he knows that if he shows up he’ll be targeted by all the other candidates who want to bring down the biggest player. And he will have to endure question after question from the Fox team and his opponents about creating a universal health care plan in Massachusetts that closely mirrors the president’s controversial health care reform plan. So his strategy is to let the little guys fight it out before they get to challenge him.                
                

            
                If Gingrich showed up he will have to answer questions from all sides about his flip-flops on U.S. intervention in Libya.                 
                

            
                Daniels knows he’d be pressed to explain why ending funding for Planned Parenthood in Indiana last week was not just a crass effort to make up with social conservatives after saying that social issues should not be the focus of this year’s Republican primary.                 
                

            
                And Bachmann is worried about being buried under demands for her to explain incorrect statements such as the claim that the federal government controls more than half of the American economy and the American Revolution started in New Hampshire.                 
                

            
                And of course, Donald Trump would have to answer uncomfortable questions about having pursued the birther question to the detriment of the Republican Party.                
                

            
                In 2008, by the time of the first primary debate, all of the major candidates had declared their intentions and showed up for the first debate. John McCain, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Huckabee went into the debate with their campaigns in full swing. Even the lesser-known candidates -- Ron Paul, Duncan Hunter, Tom Tancredo, Tommy Thompson, and Jim Gilmore – had made several trips to the early primary states and were in campaign mode. Only former Senator Fred Thompson waited several months to get into the race and found himself unable to catch up to the other candidates.                
                

            
                The 2012 season is off to a late start but it will be a spirited one. The other potential candidates will be watching. With the death of Usama Bin Laden, one wonders if any of the Republican candidates will be less enthusiastic about the getting the opportunity to take on the commander-in-chief this time around.

                ORLANDO, Fla. –  Gov. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) was one of those Tea Party stars whom voters believed had the courage of his convictions when he promised, as recently as last summer, to block The Affordable Care Act in his state. But last week, writes the Orlando Sentinel, ""Scott made an abrupt about-face, embracing a three-year expansion of Medicaid coverage for about 1 million low-income Floridians that will be paid for by the health care law.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Scott said, ""I think this is a common-sense solution to dealing with this for the next three years where it will give us the time to think about how we can improve the system."" Sounding like a Democrat, he added that the state is obligated to help ""the poorest and weakest among us."" No, governor, charities and religious bodies are obligated to help the weak and poor. State and federal governments have no such obligation. To claim they do empowers bureaucrats and politicians who are having a difficult enough time fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. It also undermines the work ethic.                
                

            
                After (borrowed) federal money runs out in three years, Florida will be expected to kick in some cash and carry on with the funding. Scott says his commitment is only for those three years, but as Ronald Reagan once wryly observed, ""...a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth!""                
                

            
                Scott, whose favorability rating was 36 percent in a December Quinnipiac University poll, is clearly looking at his vulnerability in next year's election. Apparently, he thinks sounding more like a Democrat will convince voters to give him another term in office. Perhaps he thinks the tea party votes he is likely to lose will be made up for with purchased votes from those who will line up at the federal ATM.                
                

            
                Scott is a former health care executive. The health care industry has spent millions lobbying to influence health care reform legislation, including Medicaid. They also are the largest employer in many states. Should Scott lose next year's election, taking federal Medicaid money won't hurt his chances of a high-paying position in his former profession.

                The Orlando Sentinel examined Scott's rapid turnaround on other issues dear to conservative hearts. It said he ""...has barely looked like the same guy who ran for governor in 2010"" and cited examples. After large initial budget cuts, Scott ""...proposed the largest budget in state history and said his top priority was a $2,500 raise for teachers, whom he infuriated during his first year in office by passing a merit-pay law while cutting education spending by $1.3 billion.""                
                

            
                Scott has also said nothing in several months about illegal immigration. He once pledged to back an Arizona-style immigration law that would require police to check the legal status of people they suspected were illegal. He has since backed away from this pledge.                
                

            
                Slade O'Brien, the Florida director of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, told the Sentinel he was ""flabbergasted"" by Scott's decision, saying it went beyond even his budget proposal that didn't cut spending and the teacher pay raises. ""For the governor to reverse that position, I felt incredibly shocked and so did many of his base,"" he said.                
                

            
                A few Republican governors have turned down federal money to expand Medicaid in their states. So far, Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas) is not one of them. Last week he made his intentions clear when he said, ""We're not going to be expanding Medicaid in Texas. The reason is because it's a broken system. It's moving our state -- and I'll just speak to our state -- towards bankruptcy if we expand the current program.""                
                

            
                As for Gov. Scott's turnabout, a paraphrase of the wisdom Forrest Gump's momma gave him might fit: Politicians are like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get until after they're elected.

Why Are the Media Still Falling for Obama's Health Care Deadlines?,"It’s almost too bad the health debate has moved so slowly that it missed the Oscars. Perhaps our newly indignant president would have been eligible for a Best Actor nod. But then again, sequels rarely do well with the Academy. And this act clearly isn’t anything new.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                President Obama has been fighting and losing the health care reform battle since he first took office. In fact, his only major legislative victory was the passage of the $787 billion stimulus bill. After that, the American people were more afraid of his passes than they had been of Bill Clinton’s. Voters wouldn’t let him pass anything and it showed. His popularity dropped. The Democratic Congress’s popularity dropped even further and health care reform went from blockbuster to disaster flick.                
                

            
                Still journalists are out there pushing Obama’s latest sequel, even though the whole plot has been done and done again. CBS “Early Show” co-host Harry Smith treated this installment like it’s the final chapter in a series. “President Obama makes a tough final push, going on the offensive against health insurance companies. Will it work?” he asked during a March 9 broadcast.                
                

            
                “Final push?” Since when?                
                

            
                Since last summer when Obama first made his final push? Not hardly. No, it’s the final push since Obama decided it would be and journalists have repeated it like it’s a realistic expectation. ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer made that claim. “President Obama says the debate is over on health care reform, the vote must be taken. And the train is moving out,” she told viewers March 3.                
                

            
                That certainly was the media’s party line as the president tried to bully his heath care “reform” through Congress. “Every idea has been put on the table. Every argument has been made. Everything there is to say about health care has been said. I believe the United States Congress owes the American people a final vote on health care reform,” he told an unhappy public.                
                

            
                Only, none of that is especially believable from an administration that said they had to get reform done by last summer. The administration kept changing the release date. Summer, fall, they couldn’t decide. Both the president and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi vowed to get the House vote done by August. Then Obama started making predictions about when it would get completed. “We've got to get it done this year,” Obama said to CBS News.                
                

            
                ABC’s Matthew Dowd predicted even then that Obama would succeed back on Aug. 12, 2009. “I think something will get done. I think when you have 60 members, Democratic members of the Senate and you have Congress by a large margin and you have the White House, you have to get something done.”                
                

            
                He wasn’t even close. Neither was Obama. That script ran straight into the critics who panned it in town halls across the nation. And so-called “reform” was pushed back.                
                

            
                So in August, the Democrats regrouped and pushed again, targeting September or October as their goal. And once again, they failed with almost an identical script. Obama’s goal of getting it done “this year” also failed. Then the Massachusetts Senate race provided a new subplot and yet another sequel.                
                

            
                Now we are told that health care reform will happen again this time. By March 18 before Obama goes overseas. Honest. Yet Obama is no more believable on this point that Lucy was when holding a football and daring Charlie Brown to kick it. Every time the initiative gets close to failure, he and other Democrats change the rules.                
                

            
                Even if they buy off recalcitrant Democrats, steamroll Rep. Bart Stupak and his principled pro-lifers and pass this bill, the battle is far from over. Sure Obama would sign it into law. That isn’t the question. The question is can he keep it law?                
                

            
                Opponents think that maybe he can’t. Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas wants to make the whole fight an election issue. With election day looming ever larger, that’s a good bet. “This will make sure that health care is the No. 1 issue that the election is won or lost on in November,” Cornyn told Politico.                
                

            
                And if the GOP wins even the House, they will stall Obama’s reform and ensure we have sequels that last us until 2012 when health care will be center stage once again.                
                

            
                So when the president -- and the media -- tell us health care reform must happen right now, it’s fair to wonder whether they should include a laugh track with those comments. It’s also ironic that the news industry that celebrates deadlines, ignores them when it comes to a president it celebrates even more.

                As a cardiologist, my top priority is the well-being of my patients. During the last eight years, out-of-touch politicians have imposed regulations that created more electronic paperwork and administrative tasks for health care providers, taking me away from what I do best — providing exceptional care for my patients.                
                

            
                Health care in the U.S. is broken. Smaller reimbursements, confusing Medicare filing requirements and adversarial relationships with insurers have limited my ability to connect with my patients. I now spend more time typing, doing clerical work, answering to hospital administrators and arguing with insurance company representatives about how to treat my patients than I do listening to my patients’ hearts.                
                

            
                The implementation of ObamaCare brought on “in-network” provider changes that dissolved many long-term doctor-patient relationships. Those relationships are sacred, and ObamaCare has poisoned them. There is no room for Washington in my exam room. There is no place for members of Congress or other regulators in my operating room. I implore you to make good on your promises and remove government from the health care equation.

                Throughout your campaign, you were a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act, and I am pleased that your first executive order, issued within hours of your inauguration, was aimed at dismantling ObamaCare. I am grateful that your order aggressively begins the process of repealing the ACA. I understand that your order itself cannot repeal the law, but it goes a long way toward eliminating key portions of President Obama’s signature legislation.                
                

            
                Change must come quickly. As a physician and as a patient advocate, I offer these suggestions.                
                

            
                1. Have an immediate replacement. We cannot repeal the ACA without replacing it immediately. Repeal-and-delay will destabilize the insurance market and likely result in even less access and choice for my patients.                
                

            
                2. Eliminate the individual mandate. Forcing Americans to purchase health insurance that is expensive and limited in scope is not freedom of choice. Every citizen should be allowed to choose.                
                

            
                3. Allow insurance plans to compete across state lines. Patients are far more likely to have more choices and be able to negotiate better premium prices in a competitive market. Competition will force insurance companies to provide better services for patients and doctors.                
                

            
                4. Cover pre-existing conditions. We cannot go back to the days when insurers could discriminate against or deny coverage to those with chronic medical conditions. People who have known medical conditions should be able to purchase insurance at the same rate as those who don’t.                
                

            
                5. Take on Big Pharma. We can no longer allow pharmaceutical and medical device companies to price-gouge, and we must hold their CEOs accountable for the pricing of new products. My patients want to get better, but excessive costs — the U.S. has the highest drug prices in the world — often prevent them from complying with their medication schedules. I encourage you to help drive prices down by allowing Americans to buy prescription drugs from reputable Canadian pharmacies.                
                

            
                6. Deregulate health care. Currently, doctors aren’t able to be doctors. We have become scribes. We spend hours in front of computer screens. A recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that on a typical clinic day, physicians spent only 25 percent of their patient interaction making eye contact and connecting with their patients. The remaining 75 percent of the patient interaction was spent filling out government-mandated electronic medical records.                
                

            
                7. Require patient responsibility. Preventive health practices should be a cornerstone of health insurance coverage. When patients actively participate in their health care and treatment plans, their outcomes improve. Offer lower premiums to those who exercise, diet and quit smoking. Health care reform must require patients to “buy in.”                
                

            
                8. Limit malpractice claims. Tort reform on the federal level is essential to lowering health care costs. Many physicians order unnecessary tests in order to avoid “missing something” that could result in a lawsuit. “Defensive medicine” drives up costs and puts patients at risk of unnecessary complications.                
                

            
                As you begin your first 100 days, I hope you can motivate Congress to follow your lead. Your executive order is a first step, but House Speaker Ryan and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must follow through with a quick repeal and replacement plan that puts #PatientsFirst and allows medicine to return to its roots — doctors and patients working together to improve health outcomes and ensure long and happy lives.                
                

            
                The United States has the finest health care professionals in the world. We need to make sure that doctors are free to practice medicine and that patients — no matter who they are, where they live and what their economic status is — have access to care now.                
                

            
                Remember … patients and physicians like me are counting on you and your administration to save health care.                
                

            
                Sincerely,

Health reform: The road ahead,"Now Playing                            Newt Gingrich on how GOP can make a health care bill work                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Friday's decision to pull the House Republican health reform bill was not the end of health reform. In fact, it may have been the best step toward actually achieving real health care reform -- if congressional leaders learn from the experience.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The Republican congressional leadership erred because they decided to repeal and replace ObamaCare within the traditions of the pre-Trump legislative swamp.                
                

            
                By default, they accepted the fake scores of the Congressional Budget Office. By allowing the scores to exist, they let Democrats and the media quote ""the non-partisan CBO"" to their disadvantage.                
                

            
                Leadership applied the absurd limitations of Senate reconciliation rules to a House bill, even though it was guaranteed to frustrate their conservative members.                
                

            
                They established a deadline for failure – which we know is detrimental to large legislative achievements. Ronald Reagan took eight months to pass a tax cut, which was giving away money. We took 18 months to pass welfare reform, which had the support of 92 percent of Americans. Obama took eight months to pass ObamaCare – even while he promised it would cure all our health care ills.                
                

            
                The current congressional leadership tried to pass a complicated, critical bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare in fewer than three months.                
                

            
                While Republicans focused on process, and a complex, wonky, Washington-insider argument (just read the transcripts), their opponents in the media and the left hammered away at the human cost of their bill. The result: By the time the bill was pulled, only 17 percent of Americans – or less than 1 in 5 – wanted it.                
                

            
                In an era when total outsider candidate Donald J. Trump was elected president, congressional leaders adopted a “trust us, we’re in Washington” strategy. They promised all the rough edges would be smoothed over during Stages 2 and 3 – which were obscure and undefined. Americans didn’t believe them.                
                

            
                Frankly, they were fortunate to avoid the vote. Insider health reform was a major factor in killing the Democratic House majority in 1994 – after a 40-year reign. Insider health reform killed the House Democratic majority in 2010, too. Voting for a bill with 17 percent approval might have broken the current House majority.                
                

            
                History has taught us: America doesn’t like political health care. There is a deep imperative for Congress to think through bipartisan health care reform.                
                

            
                The House and Senate GOP leadership can learn a lot of lessons from this failed experiment – if they are willing to.                
                

            
                THE ROAD AHEAD                
                

            
                There are a set of principles for successful conservative reforms. President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used them in the 1980s. We followed them in creating the ""Contract with America"" in 1994, reforming welfare in 1996 and passing the balanced budget in 1997.                
                

            
                As Thatcher said: ""First you win the argument, then you win the vote."" The best short book on her fight to reform Britain, Claire Berlinski's ""There is no Alternative: Why Margaret Thatcher Matters,"" makes clear the moral, human arguments Thatcher used to dismantle socialism in Britain.                
                

            
                The No. 1 goal of any health reform must be to communicate with the American people and convince them this will provide a much better future than the current system. Tom Evans' ""The Education of Ronald Reagan"" outlines Reagan’s years at General Electric and the lessons he learned in focusing on educating the public, so they would educate the Congress.                
                

            
                In Reagan's farewell address, he explained his legislative successes this way: ""I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me. They never saw my troops, they never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people. You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action.""                
                

            
                A new health reform effort must start by focusing on the American people and winning their support. It will be President Trump's health rallies in the states which win the day not clever insider negotiating in Washington.                
                

            
                2.  The key is to focus on health and health care, not on financing.                
                

            
                When asked about his success, Eisenhower said, “Whenever I run into a problem I can’t solve, I always make it bigger. I can never solve it by trying to make it smaller, but if I make it big enough, I can begin to see the outlines of a solution.”                
                

            
                That principle applies to reforming the health system. To solve health financing, you have to expand the discussion to the entire health system.                
                

            
                For decades, government has tried to focus on financing. Costs continue to rise. Systems get more and more complex. A bigger and bigger percentage of money is spent on bureaucracy (public and private) rather than health. People get lost in the arguments about insurance and programs, because they are highly technical and don't relate directly to their lives.                
                

            
                The first goal must be to describe the values (and the systems which will achieve those values) that matter to people.                
                

            
                People want to live longer and healthier, at lower cost, and with greater convenience. For example, people want solutions other than nursing homes. They want systems other than maintenance for diseases. They want health and independent living. There are many.                
                

            
                Health policies have to be described in both micro and macro terms.                
                

            
                Micro policies are quite simply ""what does it mean to me and my family?"" People at the personal level want to know about their own health, their access to health care, their premiums, their deductibles and whether they have access to the doctors they want.                
                

            
                Macro policies are how the society, the private sector, nonprofits and government are going to organize and incentivize activities to achieve the micro policies.                
                

            
                3. Health is the largest sector of the American economy and the most complex. Health care is at least 10 times more complicated than national security. It is one-fifth of our economy.                
                

            
                Really understanding and solving health and health care takes more time than politicians and bureaucrats have been willing to invest.                
                

            
                Hearings must be held geographically, by topic, and by specific specialties to gather enough information to develop a series of steps that will improve health and health care.                
                

            
                Listen-Learn-Help-Lead is the key system for involving the entire country and developing a comprehensive understanding of what the American people want and how to achieve it.                
                

            
                Health is broader than payments. The National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Food and Drug Administration, federal community health centers, the Indian Health Service, the Veterans Administration, Tricare, etc. are all part of the fabric of meeting our health potential.                
                

            
                4. As the health reform plan evolves, it has to be described in very detailed question-and-answer systems online, so people can understand how it affects them, health professionals can understand how they will be impacted, the news media can understand it, and the elected officials can explain and defend it.                
                

            
                The plan should meet the goals defined by President Trump during the campaign. They were the goals the American people voted for and, unlike Obama, we should keep our word.                
                

            
                The plan should be implemented in a series of bills. It is impossible to write a comprehensive health care bill. No one can understand the complexity. No one can understand all the second- and third-order effects. The 21st Century Cures bill, as a bipartisan achievement, is a better model than the HillaryCare and ObamaCare comprehensive bills.                
                

            
                5. It should be possible to outline the entire new system in a series of very clear charts, so everyone can understand the goals and the directions before being asked to support the transition process. People both have to understand the long-term values-based goals and the policy changes, which will be bridges to achieve these goals.                
                

            
                6. Properly developed, a dynamic, innovative, science-based American health system will be the largest job creator, the largest sector of high-paying jobs, and the biggest earner of foreign exchange in the country. If we liberate the American health system so it can once again be the most innovative and effective in the world, people all over the planet will buy American health products, seek American health technology, and ask to see American medical specialists. Health is not a problem, it is a great opportunity and should be approached as such.                
                

            
                7. Following a disciplined road map like this is hard work and requires more patience and more discipline than the inside Washington game. As Reagan, Thatcher, and the “Contract with America” Congress proved, it can also yield dramatically bigger and better results.

A Good Day for Democrats,"When you see Democrat Majority Leader Harry Reid standing on the Senate floor this morning congratulating his Republican challenger for the Nevada Senate seat, Sharron Angle, don't be fooled. In Sen. Reid's Machiavellian mind -- and I say that as a compliment -- he is the lion congratulating the lamb on arriving in the jungle.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It was a good day for Democrats on what’s been dubbed another “mini-Super Tuesday’ and the outcome in Nevada illustrates why. Sen. Reid can't get his re-elect numbers over 50 percent as an incumbent, power player with big campaign money, the federal budget at his hand and the White House on speed dial. His state has a big hangover from the excesses of the recession in the form of foreclosures and declines in tourism.                
                

            
                If Republicans had nominated a mainstream Republican with name recognition to capture independents and conservative Democrats it was game over, craps for Sen. Reid.                
                

            
                Instead his opponent will be Angle, a Tea Party favorite who is endorsed by Sarah Palin. She is viewed as lacking name identification, money and experience. Sue Lowden, the former TV anchor, was well known and Danny Tarkanian has his famous coach-dad's name. Angle's strongest point is her passionate support from people who want to throw out incumbents, especially the Senate majority leader.                
                

            
                But while the Tea Party distaste for health care reform, rising deficits, and fear of tax hikes remains widespread the American public's embrace of the Tea Party is ebbing in recent polls. The ABC News/ Washington Post poll released this week now has ""half the population now expressing an unfavorable impression of the loosely aligned protest campaign that has shaken up politics this year.""                
                

            
                So you can imagine the upcoming campaign ads that ask Nevada voters if they want the devil they know or the devil they don't know. Angle will be painted as passionately angry but inexperienced and a naif in the halls of state and national power politics.                 
                

            
                Sen. Reid has new life thanks to Angle's win and it is already showing up in Nevada polls which show him on the rise.                
                

            
                The same positive political dynamic for Democrats is at play in Arkansas where two-term Sen. Blanche Lincoln survived a primary challenge that reshaped her as a true moderate for a truly moderate state.                
                

            
                If Lt. Gov. Bill Halter had won the nomination there was no way he could have run as anything but a left-wing Democrat with inescapable financial ties to unions and support from MoveOn.Org. Congressman John Boozman who is still the big favorite but as former President Bill Clinton said after Lincoln's win the two-term incumbent is now the new come-back kid! She is going to get Arkansas voters to take a new look at her and that may lead them to recall why they like her and have twice elected her to the U.S. Senate.                
                

            
                And the same good news for Democrats applies in the California race. Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, spent a ton of money to win. She has more money to spend in the general election. But as compared to the candidate she beat for the nomination she is not as attractive to swing voters. Rep. Tom Campbell, her GOP challenger, is a well-known candidate with established ties to the gay community and Hispanics.                
                

            
                Fiorina does not have the same allure for independents and conservative Democrats, people angry at big spending, big taxes and Washington's failure to deal with big issues such as immigration. Fiorina's history as Hewlett-Packard also has its downside, damaging her claim to be a wise hand at business who is willing to bring her expertise to government.                
                

            
                Republicans had the senate seats in Arkansas, California and Nevada targeted as good bets for their side in this season of anger at incumbents. But with the ABC-Post poll now showing 60 percent disapproval for Republicans in Congress and the same poll finding that Democrats “hold a double-digit ledge over the GOP as the party at people trust to handle the country’s main problems,” the political playing field for the fall does not appear as favorable for Republicans as it did a few months ago.                
                

            
                And after Tuesday’s races put relatively weak Republicans in position as challengers, Democrats had more reasons to remind the GOP to not be so quick to count their chickens before they hatch in November.

America has spoken out--all kinds of people, from all the political parties turned out to speak out against the president's Big GovCare. Sadly, so many Democratic members of Congress chose to hide out and cower behind Web casts and phone calls rather than look into the faces of their constituents and see the anxiety of those they serve.                
                

            
                It was an August where dissent was demonized and some Americans were convicted in the media for merely gathering facts. They were labelled fear mongers. They were scandalized as evil-doers and members of a ""mob.""                  
                

            
                A time when fear of snitch lists for fishy behavior culminated in viral e-mails from the White House to some of those who did not invite them. A summer where our own president invoked the moral righteousness of his plan when not implying the religious inferiority of opponents.                
                

            
                One poll shows that fifty percent of the American people oppose BigGovCare. Before we found out  what the ""public option"" and other details of the plan included, most Americans were open to it. But then we heard about comparative effectiveness research and health panels, ominous quality-of-life year measurements, mandates and fines.                
                

            
                Your leaders know that their health care reform makes many of you feel sick. But Democrats in Congress, who once lauded a post-partisan America, now say that if they have the votes-- it's gonna be their way or the highway. The public be damned. Don't blame us blame the Republicans. -- We will save this presidency even if we shove the plan down your throat! Senator Harry Reid, unpopular even in his home state, may use a slick parliamentary maneuver called ""reconciliation""-- which means the opposite-- that their will not yours be done.                
                

            
                Even though the president's popularity has crashed faster than almost any modern American president and stands now at less than fifty percent. Even though the confidence rate of American in our Congress stands at only thirty-two percent, The New York Times yesterday cheered the president on ""Do it,"" they said invoking the worst of his angels, why, because ""Yes you can!"" Do it for Teddy.                
                

            
                If something is going to be done shouldn't it be done for you and your family and not Teddy?
The honest way to save a presidency and bring legitimate health care improvement is for the president to reject the Democratic partisan trajectory and illusion of transparency which has marked their health care politics.                 
                

            
                I have catalogued a sickening ballet of distraction and deception that's gone on in the past few month in which the president punches Big Pharma and health insurers in the nose publicly in the Blue Room and then shakes hands, privately, in a White House back room giveaway which means higher drug costs and higher out of pocket costs.                 
                

            
                What does this mean for you? It all means less choice and access to health care for all. Less care for seniors. Longer waits for shorter office visits with general practitioners instead of specialists. Cost benefits analyses of who gets what care and when. On every examining table a bureaucrat taking your pulse. Every man and woman a health care supplicant hoping that you are not too sick and have not lived too long.                
                

            
                The heat of August has shone a bright light on who we are and what we can afford as a people. To change the way all of us live our live and die for selfish short term political gain by invoking a departed liberal hero is to lose the confidence of Americans. To ignore the bright light shone by Mr and Mrs America is to ignore your oaths of office.                
                

            
                The future of ordinary but powerless Americans has always weighed heavier on America's scale of social justice than the political fortune of a sitting president or the imagined legacy of his now- departed political sponsor.                 
                

            
                We hope and pray that the history we make in the coming weeks keeps faith with our founders'  example.

Liberals Seek to Save Obama's Presidency By Bringing Back Bill,"A $787 billion bailout. A health care “reform” law that could bury the entire nation in debt. And a trillion-dollar deficit that could repeat every year for the foreseeable future.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                All that spending means it’s time for the Bill.                
                

            
                Bill Clinton, that is. The media and the left are so intent on saving the Obama presidency from its inner Jimmy Carter that they have brought back the one man they know could keep those evil conservatives at bay. The Big Dog himself has returned for yet another romp in the sun.                
                

            
                Obama supporters called in their last, best hope – a smiling, slimmer William Jefferson Clinton. Leties both in and out of the press want Clinton to pass his mojo onto their new favorite son. They have good reason to believe. Although his presidency was marked by scandal, it was also the first time since FDR that a Democratic president won reelection. The left knows November is coming, but they have given up on 2010 and now fear November 2012.                
                

            
                Of course the press is in full support of the sequel for the man from Hope. Clinton wasn’t just in the news for the ridiculous coverage given to his daughter Chelsea’s wedding. He was there supporting Andrew Romanoff for the U.S. Senate against Obama’s wishes. He was also the UN special envoy to Haiti meeting Haitian officials for the earthquake anniversary.                
                

            
                In all, the president-turned-punchline was on ABC, CBS and NBC more than 140 times in just three months. That’s roughly four times as often as the networks mentioned his successor, George W. Bush, in the same time.                
                

            
                There was Bill Clinton politician, smiling, glad-handing and hoping to rescue the plummeting poll numbers of his amateurish replacement. It was like the millennium never happened. MSNBC’s Chris Matthews asked the questions about the aging president liberals wanted to know: “Will Bill Clinton be the most effective Democrat this year? Will he be the happy warrior that saves the Democrats?”                
                

            
                To show how desperate the left is, Matthews argued for Clinton to be out on the campaign trail … selling values. “I'd sell Democratic values if I were him.” Presumably not the vows of chastity, fidelity, honesty and poverty, to name just a few.                
                

            
                But Matthews wasn’t the only one remembering past thrills from the Clinton camp. Barron’s Senior Editor Michael Santoli reminded ABC viewers that Clinton won in 1992 “on it’s the economy stupid,” though the recovery had already begun. That was a lesson for current voters, he explained on July 31. “But it doesn't mean the economy is really derailed just because it feels like it's no good.”                 
                

            
                Yes, that massive unemployment and all the negative economic news are all in the imaginations of voters. Prosperity is just around the corner.                
                

            
                Never fear, Bill is here, or he’s not far away. Even Obama had to swallow his overly large pride and make that happen. As ABC’s George Stephanopoulos, also a former Clinton adviser, told viewers July 15, the White House needed reinforcements. So, “to help him out, President Obama did something he hasn't done all that often. He called in Bill Clinton.”                
                

            
                Since Team Obama wants a return to the Clinton years, it makes sense that we return to Clinton terminology. Cue the media talking “triangulation.” Remember that concept? It was the “third way” pushed by then-Clinton adviser Dick Morris that advocated a mix of leftwing and rightwing policies.                
                

            
                One-time conservative-turned MSNBC talking head Joe Scarborough addressed the issue with the “Morning Joe” audience Aug. 12. Scarborough and crew discussed the chance that Gibbs’s criticism of the “professional left” was a deliberate attempt to appear more moderate. “So now he's triangulating,” summed up Scarborough.                
                

            
                On ABC’s new “This Week” with silly lefty Christiane Amanpour, they talked about how a loss in the midterms could actually help Obama in 2012 by putting heat on the GOP. According to Thompson-Reuters Global Editor-at-Large Chrystia Freeland, such a result might be needed so Obama “can start to triangulate.”                
                

            
                For all that talk about Obama being more like Clinton, he’s been like Carter – waffling while the economy and the country go decline. On the mosque issue alone he took four separate positions in the space of a week – first he wouldn’t comment, then he was for it, then he backed off and finally he backed off backing off. That’s not leadership, it’s clown college.                
                

            
                The Christian Science Monitor said it well on July 14. “When President Clinton lost control of Congress in his first midterms, in 1994, he was able to regroup and ‘triangulate’ his way to reelection, by finding common cause with conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans. Whether Obama has the skill to do that is questionable.”                
                

            
                That’s OK. Democrats are prepared in case the Clinton offensive doesn’t work. They have another Clinton in mind. Already there’s talk of Hillary taking over at vice president or Hillary running in the primary. The Hill newspaper even had Hillary taking over the Pentagon. “Speculation in the nation's capital on who will replace Robert Gates at the Pentagon has centered on an intriguing possibility: Hillary Rodham Clinton.”                
                

            
                So, really, the Democrats only have one seven-letter strategy – Clinton. And they say conservatives are the ones without ideas.

Forget Reconciliation -- Why the Real Fight Is In the House,"Opponents of Obama’s so-called health care reform are understandably up in arms at the president’s embrace of reconciliation as a way to force changes to his bill through the Senate. --It feels as if Scott Brown’s election had never happened. Reconciliation, part of the budget process designed to raise or lower revenues or spending, was never designed as a way to change the rules to pass controversial policy changes that otherwise would fail for lack of 60 votes needed to invoke cloture. But as outrageous as reconciliation is, ultimately it’s a distraction, and free-market activists who focus on it may miss the real fight in the U.S. House of Representatives.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Ultimately, it doesn’t matter whether or not the Senate passes changes to its health care bill via reconciliation. That’s because the reconciliation process cannot even begin until after the House passes the Senate bill exactly as it passed the Senate on Christmas Eve. That means it must pass with the abortion language already rejected by Rep. Bart Stupak and others still intact. It also must pass with the outrageous pork barrel spending deals cut for Nebraska, Louisiana, Connecticut, and others. In other words, the bill must pass the House with everything in it that the American people have already made clear they hate.                
                

            
                As a practical matter, the Senate has no reason to take another politically risky vote unless that House has already proven it has the votes to pass the core vehicle, the Christmas Eve version of the Senate bill. -- At this point it’s far from clear that Nancy Pelosi can get the 216 votes she needs to get it passed. More importantly, as a procedural matter, the Senate almost certainly cannot even proceed to a reconciliation bill by making changes to the Christmas Eve bill if it hasn’t already been enacted into law. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which creates the official cost estimates of the tax changes in federal legislation, has said it cannot and will not provide cost estimates for a reconciliation health care bill unless the underlying bill has already been passed by the House. Without those scores, it’s impossible to determine if the reconciliation bill meets the requirements of the budget process.                
                

            
                North Dakota Democrat Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, put it pretty bluntly: “I don't know of any way, I don't know of any way where you can have a reconciliation bill pass before the bill that it is meant to reconcile passes. I don't know how you would deal with the scoring. I don't know how I could look you in the eye and say this package reduces the deficit. It's kind of got the cart before the horse.”                
                

            
                So the House has to go first. And the House vote is all that matters. If the Senate bill passes the House, Obama will sign it and it will be the law of the land. Maybe the Senate will make some tweaks to it via reconciliation. Maybe they won’t. Ultimately it won’t matter, because either way vast new taxes will be imposed to support over 100 new regulatory entities that will give Washington the power to micromanage every aspect of our health care. Either way we’ll all be forced -- under threat of incarceration -- to buy expensive health insurance from favored private insurance companies, whether we want it or not. In other words, if the House passes the Christmas Eve Senate bill, the game is up and the American people lose. If, on the other hand, the House rejects the original Senate bill, it’s all over.                
                

            
                So as outrageous as the reconciliation maneuver is, it’s ultimately inconsequential. It’s a bright, shiny object, designed to distract opponents from the fight that really matters. That real fight is in the House, and will be over, in victory or defeat, before the Senate does or doesn’t use reconciliation.                
                

            
                In his latest health care speech on Wednesday President Obama said this fight over health care is ultimately about what kind of country we want to be. He’s exactly right. But unlike President Obama and his extreme left-wing allies, most Americans prefer the American system of free markets and individual responsibility to the false security of a cradle-to-grave, European-style welfare state. That’s what hangs in the balance on the biggest health care vote in decades, or maybe ever. And that vote will be in the House, not the Senate.

It's the Money That Matters Most In Health Care Debate,"As a precursor to the bipartisan White House health care discussion on February 25, the Center for Health Transformation is hosting the American People’s Online Health Summit. The intent of this ongoing blog is to provide all Americans an opportunity to say what they want out of the health care talks and to hear about solutions from health care experts.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The cost of health care in the U.S. remains one of the most frustrating aspects of the system. The American people spend a staggering amount on health care each year. In fact, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated the U.S. spent $2.3 trillion (or more than 16 percent of the entire economy) in 2009 alone on health care. The CHT blog provides a forum where Americans can discuss the issue of cost, how it affects them, and what reforms are necessary to lower cost while not sacrificing the quality of their health care.                
                

            
                Throughout the debate on health care reform undertaken by the Obama administration and Congress, not enough focus has been placed on curbing the overall cost of the system. CMS projects that total health care spending will double to $4.5 trillion per year by 2019 and consume nearly 20 percent of the U.S gross domestic product. This level of spending is untenable and must be addressed directly and appropriately.                
                

            
                During our blog focusing on the cost of health care, myriad creative solutions are being offered. These innovative ideas come from both the public and private sectors – indicating just how much this issue should be a priority.                
                

            
                Individuals like U.S. Rep. Michael Burgess M.D., former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, and James Gelfand of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce present critical solutions. Scott Serota, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, and Merrit Quaram, M.D., CEO of Qmedtrix Systems, provide proven solutions in the industry. Perhaps more impressive is that Americans continue to pour in ideas to solve this critical dilemma.                
                

            
                Solutions sought for immediate reform include undertaking medical liability reform efforts, changing incentives to provide the best possible care, enforcing the adaption of technological advancement in health care, and others. For example, Texas has saved $574 million in liability insurance premiums as a result of similar reforms, as noted by Congressman Burgess.

Participant Isaac commented, “There are alternatives to paying trillions for the government to look at what their computer tells them about the most intimate details of your life and then decide what treatment you should get from their underpaid doctors.” Additionally, participant Larry House noted, “If everyone could pay their health care premiums directly to the hospital system where they live or work that would reduce health care costs by 30%-40%. Then you would have the health care system and professionals not only providing health care but administering it as well.”                
                

            
                While the American People’s Online Health Summit continues, it is clear that cost remains one of, if not the, most important aspects of health care reform. Numerous ways to achieve this goal exist, and policymakers must incorporate real cost-saving measures into any legislation in order to accomplish true reform.

If Democrats Don't Pivot On Health Care They're Doomed,"While the news reports after the recently concluded health care summit largely trumpeted the failure of the two parties to reach agreement, the reality is actually a lot more complicated and even encouraging. The fact of the matter is that the Blair House event ultimately demonstrated a substantial amount of agreement between the two parties and the possibility of achieving a bipartisan agreement relatively quickly.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Reports indicate that the president is finally coming to grips with the fact that the American people just don’t support the comprehensive reform package that passed the House and the Senate. And regardless, it will be quite difficult for the president to gain enough support from election-nervous lawmakers on his package. Reportedly, the White House has drawn up alternative legislation – a “Plan B” -- that’s more limited in scope, covering about 15 million uninsured and only making modest expansions to the public insurance system.                
                

            
                This is a positive development. It means that the president is willing to reconsider some of his commitments and is adjusting his expectations to the political realities of the country. However, to be successful he can’t just be appending some of the Republican ideas to a bad bill. He needs to truly follow a plan B that takes the best elements of both sides and incorporates them into a new. In doing so, there’s no reason why this can’t quickly become the President’s “Plan A.”                
                

            
                This plan starts with Democrats going back to the drawing board. They need to develop a bipartisan bill that’s scaled down and targeted to specific problems in our health system. And the basis of this new bill should be the policies that find support on both sides of the aisle.                
                

            
                Lawmakers should start with prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage to customers based on pre-existing conditions, or altering a patient’s policy after they get sick. As Republican Rep. Charles Boustany (R-La.) remarked at the summit: “We all agree on prohibiting insurance companies from arbitrarily canceling insurance policies. That's a no-brainer.""                
                

            
                Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) described the practice of discriminating based on pre-existing conditions as “cruel,” going on to say that “it is capricious and it is done only to enhance the bottom-line.”                
                

            
                Both lawmakers are right. It’s unfair to deny sick patients health coverage. And it’s unconscionable to kick people off insurance once their sick, forcing patients bare their medical bills all on their own.                
                

            
                Reforming insurance regulations to prohibit this practice could form the backbone of the new reform package.                
                

            
                Both parties also agree the importance of moving forward – quickly – with the adoption of health information technology. Too many doctor’s offices and hospitals continue to use paper records. This leads to long delays, subpar treatment, and a host of other inefficiencies. This reform is long overdue.                
                

            
                Another area of agreement is malpractice reform. Baseless torts are costing this country well over a $100 million a year. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who was once a practicing OB/GYN, was particularly forceful on this issue at the summit. He said that “doctors are risk averse to the tort system and the extortion system that’s out there today.”                
                

            
                At the end of the event, President Obama specifically named malpractice reform as an idea he’s going to give greater consideration.                
                

            
                Curbing insurance company discrimination and reforming malpractice would go a long way toward righting the health system.                
                

            
                If the president decides to forgo compromise and move forward with his original bill, only two things could happen -- both spell political disaster for Democrats.                
                

            
                He could fail -- with moderate Democrats voting “nay” out of fear of political pushback. In that case, Obama would look incredibly weak. Health care has been the defining issue of his presidency so far. And the perception of inefficacy could cost Democrats control of both chambers in November.                
                

            
                Alternatively, the Democrats could jam the existing health bill through Congress via reconciliation, a Senate procedure that lets them ignore Republicans. But that would be an act of just the sort of hyper-partisanship Americans have rejected time and again. Indeed, a recent CNN poll found that nearly three and four Americans want lawmakers to either abandon the existing bill and start over, or drop health care reform altogether.                
                

            
                The nation can’t afford to drop health care reform. So Democrats must move forward with a package that can pass.                
                

            
                With the recent passage of the jobs bill in the Senate, Democrats proved that bipartisanship is still possible. Fully five Republicans, including Republican Scott Brown (R-Mass.), who recently won Ted Kennedy’s seat in Massachusetts, broke rank and voted for the legislation.                
                

            
                Now is the time for the president to make good on his campaign promise to bring post-partisanship to Washington. There is room for agreement on health care. Pundits who claim the debate is irreconcilable are just plain wrong. Democrats need to hone in on the policies with Republican support, and pass a bill as soon as possible that makes those policies a reality.

Angry About Health Care? Remember Prohibition.,"Folks, first I have to say that Sunday's passage of national health care legislation by the House(219 to 212) has got me fuming. On a personal level I worry that the health care bill will deprive me and those I love of the opportunity to get the finest health care in the world here at home. As an American, I worry that this is another step toward taking away that fire of self-reliance, common sense and, yes, risk, that is at the core of what it means to be an American.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But it is as a marketer that my jaw really drops and I find myself shouting at the television: what do these geniuses think they’re doing?                
                

            
                Fact is, from a marketing perspective this new health care law is about as ham-fisted and stupid as the Volstead Act of 1919. Yes, I’m speaking about Prohibition.

Now you might not think that there is a connection between the landmark legislation that made it illegal for any person to “manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, or furnish any intoxicating liquor” and a health care plan that is supposedly intent on providing every person with health care.                
                

            
                But the marketing of health care and the marketing of Prohibition have one big thing in common: there’s been no genuine marketing only political maneuvering and one-upmanship.                
                

            
                Prohibition was a political triumph, in much the same way as Sunday’s historic vote. And looked at strictly politically, it really was a triumph, because no one except a relatively small band of powerful zealots really wanted it and somehow they managed to push it through the legislative process. In that sense it was an achievement –something hard to pull off. But just because something is hard to do, doesn’t mean that you should do it or stand around afterward patting yourself on the back.

Health care has shaped up the same way. The Democrats might have the majority in this fight and deployed it well, but their triumph is and will be a political triumph only. And it’s all about them and not the majority who were not in favor of this bill! It’s also all about Barack Obama wanting to be the first president to get serious health care reform passed and about the Democrats believing that they know best about what the American people need and want. -- But, remember, people buy brands, not companies. And health care reform is one brand they simply don’t want to buy. It’s like manufacturing that re-usable mousetrap that no one will buy because after it is used once, who wants to use it again?!

What’s wrong with ignoring the marketing? Plenty. Marketing is listening. Ignoring marketing in building legislation means ignoring what the people want –this is never good because a) legislators are there to serve the people’s needs and b) the people vote. In neither case, Prohibition or health care did the people really want the kind of things being delivered by the legislation. And this should never be forgotten especially when it comes to the upcoming election this coming November.

Luckily, history can tell us what will happen with health care.

Bottom line, big reforms like this aren’t easy to undo even if the party that puts them into place gets promptly thrown out of office. That’s why passage of this health care reform matters so much –we are all going to be living with the results for a very long time.

The good news is that Volstead was eventually repealed when it became crystal clear to everyone including many of those originally for it that such legislation was an awful idea.

The bad news is that a great deal of damage can be done before the legislation is repealed. Among other things, prohibition of alcohol in this country led to the rise of criminal gangs who -- to be honest— understood marketing a lot better than the politicians. They saw that there was a great need to fill and they built their outlaw enterprises to fill it.

Prohibition led to the increasing power and presence of organized crime in our country and, even though the Act didn’t outlaw the consumption of alcohol, it put most Americans in the awkward position of defying their own government by supporting the illegal trade. This is what happens when legislation is passed without the marketing concept. The marketing concept for a product always puts the customer’s wants and needs first. The marketing concept for legislation must do the same.

Unfortunately, we can expect the same kind of unintended consequences for health care reform as we saw with Prohibition. We may very well third-worldize our health care system. We might just be looking at a future where Americans fly to other countries for treatment, where we lose our top medical talent or dis-incentivize our best and brightest from becoming doctors, where we see the growth in “underground” medical services to meet the need of patients who are faced with an unworkable bureaucracy. And what is this going to do to the free enterprise that has driven so much medical innovation? No one knows.                
                

            
                When the columnist Robert Samuelson, whom you might expect would have supported health care reform, attacks the legislation as bad for our country’s long-term interests and the president and Democrats in Congress for serving their own reform agenda which he labels “self-indulgent,” you’ve got to take notice. What he’s saying is that they think they know better than everyone else.                
                

            
                People who think this way usually don’t listen –and, folks, they’re not. But they will when we go to the polls –but will it be too late?                
                

            
                And remember, the business of politics is always easier when you keep marketing in mind.

Obama One Year Later -- Small 'Change',"Reuters
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                One year after Barack Obama won the presidency his campaign pledge of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Change You Can Believe InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has gone from an inspirational pledge to a laugh line for critics.

From ""Saturday Night Live"" to Congressional Republicans the question hanging in the air is: Ã¢â‚¬Å“What has the new president achieved to satisfy his defining promise to bring change to America?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Two smartass answers jump to mind. And there is more truth to them than the nation, Democrats, Republicans and independents, might want to admit.                
                

            
                First, he is still not President George W. Bush. ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest achievement after one year remains that he pushed Bush and the Republicans out of the White House. And for a lot of voters that is all it takes to get their continued support.                
                

            
                The 2008 election will be defined in history as a major anti-Bush vote, a repudiation of unpopular wars and a bad economy. In November of last year President Bush had the lowest approval rating -- 22 percent -- of any president since 1938, when the Gallup polling organization began measuring public approval of the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader. Incredibly, Vice President Dick CheneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approval numbers reached even lower at 13 percent. It is no wonder that Republican nominee John McCain rarely mentioned the Republicans in the White House during his campaign against Obama.                
                

            
                Just last week Republicans in Washington could only shake their heads at news that Obama has spent more time golfing that President Bush, done about six times more political fundraisers in his first year, spent only four hours in New Orleans on his only trip there in his first year in office -- after criticizing Bush for lack of attention after Hurricane Katrina-- and yet seems immune to the negative public perception that made Bush such a political liability.                
                

            
                President Obama and his aides still find the Bush administration a convenient foil when facing political trouble.                
                

            
                The presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature fail-safe political move in speeches about the economy is to simply point back to the Bush administration and explains he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand the extent of the economic problems they left behind.                
                

            
                Without President Bush to blame there is no way voters would not be holding President Obama to blame for not keeping to pledge to hold unemployment under 8 percent.                
                

            
                A year ago, when voters were specifically asked about the economy by Gallup, more than 60 percent said the economy had to be his top priority. Now, with the economy beginning to grow again that intense, singular concern from the electorate is down to 40 percent, according to Gallup. That is very good news for President Obama if it gives him more time for the economy to pick up before voters stop looking back at President Bush and start to blame him for the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s financial woes.                
                

            
                And even with the declining interest in the economy, the economy is still the number one issue for voters there is no way for President Obama to hold his current 50 percent approval rating in a recent Gallup daily tracking poll without the strong memory of President Bush and dark economic news of the fall of 2008.                
                

            
                A CBS News/New York Times poll gave the president a similar 56 percent approval rating at the start of October. That is down from April when the new president had a 68 percent approval number. In that critical six month period the poll found the biggest slippage in support for the president among independent voters, 13 percentage points, but more than half of Independents, 52 percent, still approve of Obama.                
                

            
                Among Republicans the drop in support is nearly as large at 11 percent but the GOP support for Obama started at a lower level and is now at only 20 percent. His support among fellow Democrats remains stratospheric at 87 percent, down only 4 percent. The large divide between Republicans and Democrats is a reflection of the biggest single area of disappointment with Obama among voters. In November of last year 54 percent of voters said they expected the new president to heal the partisan divide in the nation and now only 28 percent see him as capable of that feat.                
                

            
                The Obama White House also points in the rear view mirror to justify the presidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on-going struggle to decide whether to send added troops to Afghanistan. The lack of public support for the war in Afghanistan is directly tied to the last 8 years of U.S. involvement there under President Bush with no clear change for the better.                
                

            
                My second smartass answer to what the president has achieved in his first year in office is that he remains the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first black president. He is still the fresh face of the rising mix of blacks, Hispanics, immigrants and young idealists that is creating a massive makeover for the national identity. Those voters as a power base constitute a huge shift from the mostly white, older voters who make up the heart of a shrinking Republican party.                
                

            
                ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on going contribution to the shifting look of American politics is also why Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize.                
                

            
                To quote from the Nobel committeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s award citation, Obama is to honored for his extraordinary Ã¢â‚¬Å“effortsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at building cooperation among people. -- No achievement is cited only Ã¢â‚¬Å“efforts.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½                
                

            
                In his first year, a laundry list of ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s success at change might include expanding childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health care, a pledge to stop the use of torture on detainees, passage of a stimulus package and budget and an equal pay law. -- He is still at work at health care reform and is way behind on climate change and immigration legislation.                
                

            
                But as his first year comes to a close the biggest claim President Obama has to actual transformative achievement that fulfills his pledge for Ã¢â‚¬Å“changeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is that for most voters he remains NOT George W. Bush.

"Don't Be Fooled, Republicans Are Facing Big Challenges","The new Republican majority in the House is going to have to live with the Ghost of Christmas Past. The haunting words they will keep hearing on cold January nights and beyond came from President Obama's last press briefing before the Christmas holiday.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Asked to preview his unprecedented relationship with a Republican controlled House, the president used words that will weigh on the opposition party. “You know, my sense is the Republicans recognize that with greater power is going to come greater responsibility,” the president said. “And some of the progress that I think we saw in the lame duck was a recognition on their part that people are going to be paying attention to what they're doing, as well as what I’m doing and what the Democrats in Congress are doing.""                 
                

            
                The president’s words dragged Republicans away from the happy-go-lucky days as backbenchers who denied any accountability for federal government’s success or failures for first two years of his administration.                 
                

            
                Republicans spent their time demonizing Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House under the Democrat’s majority, and bashing President Obama as a big government liberal who did not keep his administration’s promise to reduce unemployment.                 
                

            
                The closest the GOP came to spelling out ideas for how to better run the government came in the form of a much anticipated book by young Republicans, the “Pledge,” that even among fellow Republicans never lived up to the hype.                
                

            
                Now the challenge for the Republicans is go beyond any pledge to actually governing. Yes, there will be investigations complete with embarrassing questions for administration officials. But the odds are against the second coming of Watergate unless the press missed some really big shenanigans by Obama’s czars and secret socialists.                
                

            
                But independent voters who swung heavily to the Republican column in November to give the GOP control of the House are likely to have little patience with time consuming hearings when they are expecting to see results on serious issues like job creation, deficit reduction and even immigration policy. And still another big test of leadership that all Americans will be watching is what will happen to what's left of No Child Left Behind, no called, ""Race to the Top"" by the Obama administration.                
                

            
                Even bigger trouble lurks in the form of the Tea Party, the energizing force that sent so many of the new Republican faces to Washington. The Republicans are trying to immediately feed the Tea Party with promises of repealing the president’s health care plan. But even Tea Party die-hards know there is no chance of an actual repeal with Democrats retaining the majority of the Senate and president holding the power of the veto.                
                

            
                So all the focus on repeal opens the Republican Party up to charges of playing the Tea Party for fools. Rep. Rosa DeLauria (D-Conn.) is already calling the GOP act a ""kabuki dance,"" – a pretty game of pretense in which the performers are hidden behind masks and get lots of TV time for their dramatic gestures but nothing much gets done.                
                

            
                If Democrats are able to mock Republicans right out of the box Republicans are in serious trouble. They are also giving Democrats a running start at finally explaining the benefits of health care reform.                 
                

            
                Democrats will be able to lay out the goodies in the legislation such as how it keeps insurance companies from interfering with decisions most people prefer to keep between themselves and their doctors. The Democrats might also mention that their plan protects you from being denied insurance coverage when you get cancer or any other catastrophic illness and helps your college grad keep his or her health insurance until they get a job.                
                

            
                Do Republicans really want to give Democrats center stage to talk about the benefits of the Obama plan? Are they really going to prove that the Congressional Budget Office is corrupt in estimating that the plan is going to cut the deficit? And what entitlement programs is the new Republican majority willing to cut?                
                

            
                Nancy Pelosi asked just that question yesterday at her final press conference as Speaker. She seemed quite content to be in attack mode on the spending issue, promising to Republicans' feet to the fire even on an issue that was a winner for them Republicans during the 2010 campaign.                
                

            
                The challenge for Republicans will be to avoid falling into the Democrats’ trap of wasting time with political arguments when voters are looking for good ideas to revive trust in the federal government.                
                

            
                But the biggest challenge remains avoiding a trap of their own making, getting lost in frightful remembrances of their own campaign rhetoric when they said they had all the answers if only those terrible Democrats would listen. Now Republican insurgents may think back and wish they had done more than just say no and promise to obstruct every Democrat-backed plan until the day they could regain control of the House.                
                

            
                Well, that day is here. The first few weeks with the new Speaker and all the young fresh faces in the Republican ranks are sure to result in a honeymoon between Republicans, the voters and the media. But honeymoons do end. And the ghosts of past promises can hang around to haunt politicians for a very long time.                
                

            
                The best hope for Republicans is to promise to do better than their past and get serious about the business of governing.

                They’re practically the first words out of one’s mouth the second a Washington reporter hears about a new health reform proposal: ""How many people does your plan cover?""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The basic premise of the America Next health plan I’m endorsing today is simple: “I believe the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting health care. The problem is they can’t afford it.”                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                In short, I agree with Barack Obama.                
                

            
                Of course, Barack Obama circa January 2008—when he uttered those words in opposition to a health insurance mandate -- represents a far cry from the Barack Obama who signed ObamaCare into law in March 2010.

                The president backtracked on nearly every single promise he made: on an individual mandate, keeping your plan, cutting premiums by $2,500 per year, and even on taxing health benefits -- all in the name of achieving the left’s utopia of “universal coverage.” And in return, America has been left with shredded promises, cancelled insurance plans, and a major-league case of buyer’s remorse.                
                

            
                So no, I won’t endorse a plan that sees tens of millions of Americans forced to buy health insurance under pain of taxation.                 
                

            
                I won’t endorse a plan that sees millions of other Americans forced out of the insurance they like, simply because it doesn’t meet some Washington bureaucrat’s standards. And I won’t endorse a plan that sees Americans extended the promise of insurance, only to find out that the “coverage” provided doesn’t guarantee they’ll receive the care they need.                 
                

            
                We already have all that -- it’s called ObamaCare, and it needs to be fully repealed, because it’s the problem.                
                

            
                Here’s the solution.                
                

            
                First, we need to focus like a laser beam on the health care issue Americans care most about:rising costs.                 
                

            
                The plan I’m endorsing includes an innovative $100 billion grant program that incentivizes our “laboratories of democracy”—the states—to come up with insurance reforms and other solutions that can stem the rising tide of health costs. States’ eligibility for the grants would be tied to their ability to lower insurance premiums for their citizens.                
                

            
                We include other reforms in our plan too -- tax equity between employer and individually-purchased health plans, lawsuit reform, wellness incentives, and new incentives for Health Savings Accounts.                 
                

            
                These reforms have proven track records of success -- and analysis from top economists to back them up.                 
                

            
                In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, analyzing a similar state-based approach in 2009, concluded that the kinds of ideas included in our plan would lower premiums on the individual health insurance market by $5,000 per year when compared to current projections. That, and not ObamaCare “rate shock,” is true change America can believe in.                
                

            
                Second, we need to protect the safety net for the most vulnerable. As someone whose mother arrived on these shores pregnant with me, I’m well aware of the plight of Americans with pre-existing conditions. I was one -- from birth.                 
                

            
                My son Shaan’s desperate fight for survival from a childhood heart defect reinforced my belief in making sure those with major illnesses don’t get left out in the cold. But we didn’t need to give up all the good things in the system to fix the bad. Extending coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions didn’t require throwing millions of Americans off their current plans, or turning the IRS into the health insurance police.                
                

            
                Here’s a better solution. Our plan’s state grant program requires states applying for grants to guarantee access for individuals with pre-existing conditions. A state could guarantee access through a high-risk pool, through reinsurance, or through some other mechanism. But our plan ensures that the most vulnerable won’t fall through the cracks, and provides $100 billion in resources that states can use to subsidize that coverage.                
                

            
                Third, we should make insurance more portable, to enhance personal choice. Rather than taking away choices by regulatory fiat, we should give Americans more insurance options, so they can purchase plans they will own, hold, and keep. But if people like their existing plan, they won’t have to worry about it getting taken away by some government bureaucrat saying it doesn’t comply with a new mandate.                
                

            
                As someone who studied public policy in college, and worked in health policy all my adult life, I know ObamaCare is bad policy.                 
                

            
                The law may have been sold as a solution to the problem of pre-existing conditions. But it solidifies government -- through taxes, mandates, regulations, and your friendly bureaucrats at the IRS -- as a pre-existing condition in our health care system, and in the lives of all Americans.                
                

            
                That’s not reform.                
                

            
                As a governor, I know states can do better. We need solutions, but not Washington-centric bureaucracy disguised as “reform”—we’ve done that already, and it hasn’t worked.                 
                

            
                By contrast, conservative governors throughout the country have implemented successful health reforms -- from the Hoosier State’s Healthy Indiana Plan, to Rhode Island’s innovative Medicaid waiver, to the Bayou Health program we’ve created right here in Louisiana. These reforms have lowered costs -- in some cases dramatically -- improved the quality of care, and received widespread public support.                
                

            
                But in many states, including Louisiana, we would go further with our reforms, if only Washington bureaucrats would get out of the way. At the risk of echoing Churchill, that’s the better way forward on health care -- give states the tools, and let them do the job.                
                

            

            
                
                    
                
                


 

	Republican Bobby Jindal is governor of Louisiana and a former Republican candidate for president of the United States."
Why Santorum Appeals to Women and Evangelicals,"I don’t want to brag — well, maybe I do — but as I predicted, Iowans rallied their support around Senator Rick Santorum.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Coming in second to Mitt Romney by only eight votes, Sen. Santorum made a remarkable leap out of last place and into second in Iowa in little over a week.                 
                

            
                In a year of surges, Santorum seems to have timed his perfectly. But what’s behind this new support for someone who had to fight for air time during each and every debate?                
                

            
                The picture didn’t look good. Yes, Santorum recently became popular, but he was slapped as a “big spender” by Bachmann and Perry. And a Des Moines Register poll released just three days prior to the caucus showed that 41 percent of Iowans were undecided or could be persuaded to change their minds.                 
                

            
                What were they lacking? Confidence. It’s something we already lack under the current administration and thus a quality we crave from our next candidate.                
                

            
                In conservative circles, it’s common to hear embarrassed explanations for our various candidates of choice. Common statements include, “I know he’s boring and believes in nothing, but we have to connect with independents,” or “Yes, he says dumb stuff and has a woman problem, but we need a businessman.” And, frankly, people get sick of candidates speaking of themselves in the third person, forgetting their own plans, and comparing themselves to football players. It’s cringe-inducing.                
                

            
                After playing the field for weeks, women in Iowa finally settled down with their man. In fact, CNN entrance polls showed that the majority of women were supporting Santorum at twenty-seven percent (despite the sweater vest). It wasn’t a woman candidate this time, but I’m convinced that it will happen.                 
                

            
                Michele Bachmann was a serious candidate, a fierce competitor, and an excellent communicator. She made everyone in the race better, because she made them define their conservative credentials. This wasn’t her year, but mark my words, her day will come.                
                

            
                Santorum’s appeal to women and evangelicals centers on a desire for authenticity. Rick’s been consistent in behavior and record. His stance on the sanctity of life and traditional marriage gained the voters’ attention.                 
                

            
                His personal story of a strong marriage and eight children, including baby Gabriel, who died, and beautiful Bella, who is severely handicapped and the apple of her father’s eye is beyond reproach. His record in the U.S. Senate is one of unwavering support of conservative principles. His foreign policy acumen is equal to anyone on the debate stage.                
                

            
                He did finish well, but he didn’t finish first. As my father always joked, second place is the first loser. Mitt Romney was the winner last night.                 
                

            
                The man many are calling “most electable” came out on top in Iowa.                
                

            
                Many of my Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee (CWALAC) members respect Mitt’s savvy business skills, but they are having a hard time wrapping their minds around him as a whole package.                 
                

            
                They can’t ignore that it was the former Massachusetts governor who championed health care reform that cost the state $4.3 billion and 18,000 jobs. Nor can they ignore his past support for so-called “domestic partnerships” or the fact that after the Massachusetts Supreme Court’s paper tiger ruling on “gay marriage,” he ordered Justices of the Peace in the state to issue marriage licenses to homosexual couples or be fired.                
                

            
                With evangelical Christians being one of the largest voting blocs in America, “the Mormon thing” may be an issue, but I am not convinced this is what has held him back. However, some of my CWALAC ladies would love to understand the whole “eternal pregnancy in heaven thing,” which, admittedly, to me sounds more like damnation than heaven.                
                

            
                No one is perfect, but explaining the Santorum surge is easy when you see how every other candidate comes with more baggage than Louis Vuitton.                
                

            
                Newt Gingrich has, rightly, been forgiven for his previous marital failures, but can conservatives truly forget? Of the remaining candidates, however, I actually believe Newt has the best chance of resurgence.                
                

            
                Ron Paul’s “new isolationism” is scaring security moms, and he has made us all blanch over his views on the legalization of drugs and prostitution. What may ultimately be his downfall is his misplaced view of the 10th Amendment versus the federal government’s correct role in protecting individual liberty as exemplified by forced integration. While he did come in third, it seems like the only “President Paul” America will vote into office someday might be Rand, not Ron.                
                

            
                All Republican candidates would do well to remember who they’re trying to beat — ultimately an incumbent president — and maintain decorum on the campaign trail. After all, it was Ronald Reagan who maintained the 11th Commandment, “Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.”                
                

            
                Apparently, some media pundits have decided to go in another direction on the issue of civility. Most recently, Alan Colmes was forced to apologize for stating that in 1996 Santorum brought his dead baby boy home to “play with it.”                
                

            
                Colmes’ cold, heartless comment couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, when a voter asked why the Santorum family made the decision to bring their deceased newborn home, Santorum’s wife Karen, broke down in tears, and Santorum courageously responded that he made the (no doubt) difficult decision because it was important that his six other children understand that they had a brother, and allow Rick and his wife a brief time of emotional healing.                
                

            
                Hopefully, Colmes now realizes that parents’ recovery after the loss of a child isn’t for him to judge. I plan to “have a word with him” on this point the next time I see him in the Fox News green room.                
                

            
                I predicted last night’s results, which truly surprised some of the mainstream media, because I had confidence in the people of Iowa.                
                

            
                I also have great confidence in our democratic process. Only eight people decided the winner and loser in Iowa. Isn’t that awesome?                
                

            
                Let us all remember that every vote counts and that regardless of which candidate we each choose, we do have a responsibility to choose. Alexis de Tocqueville said, “In democracy we get the government we deserve.” Let us pray we deserve better leadership than we have had these past three years.

                 After reading Pres. Obama's proposal, have your views about passing health care reform changed?Yes. It’s not perfect, but I now think I at least could support a large part this approach.
No. I was happy with the House or Senate versions and this just waters down our big chance at tough reform.
No. Both bills are incredibly flawed, and this is just puts a Band-Aid over bad legislation. Start over, and make it a real bipartisan, transparent effort.

Why Self-Insurance Is the Answer to Our Health Care Mess,"Despite its current problems, the U.S. economy is still the envy of the world, largely because it is still more or less governed by an entrepreneurial spirit. The idea that a person with a new idea or a better idea can, as a general principle, succeed through hard work and yes, luck, is still a vital component of what used to be called “The American Dream.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It’s also in danger of becoming extinct. Thanks to the heavy hand of government and the rapacious nature of the lawsuit brigade, individual initiative is being taxed, regulated and sued – if not out of existence – then into the backseat of the American economy. Big business, in partnership with big government and big law, is attempting to level the playing field among existing actors and push the little guy, the future competitor, out of the way.                
                

            
                Health care reform is one example of that idea in practice. The efforts underway by the Obama White House, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi  to force a government-run health insurance system on working Americans will be a job killer. The public option provision requires billions in new tax dollars gathered from fines and assessments on businesses as well as outright federal levies to be funded. And it would allow big business to rid itself of future legacy costs by abandoning its current health insurance programs. Such a move would require them to pay a substantial penalty but, say more than a few analysts, that penalty would likely cost a company less than it would to maintain its current plan.                
                

            
                One real loser in such a move would be the workers, who would then be forced into a public option, government-run program long on waiting time and rationing and short on quality care. Another would be American small business, who would be saddled with the mandate and the expense and, in effect, handed a competitive disadvantage against the bigger companies.
It doesn’t have to be this way. Even now, small business is showing that there are sensible, market-friendly alternatives to government-run plans, even with mandates in place, which represent a better deal for employers and their employees.                
                

            
                Like health care may soon be, most every American employer carries a mandate to purchase workers’ compensation insurance, which they typically do through the traditional insurance market. For employers, despite what the trial bar may allege, such insurance is at the heart of small business because it means employees are taken care of in the event of accidents on the job. Contrary to the odd example that often makes news, an injured worker is an unproductive worker, meaning that is it not just the employee who suffers economic damage when someone is hurt on the job.                
                

            
                In the government-run, government-mandated model, employers are left mostly on the sidelines once they sign the check putting the policy in force. An employer with an injured worker is left out of the equation once an accident occurs, leaving them at the mercy of the insurance company administering the plan, the state – which may or may not investigate – and their attorneys, who may or may not hammer out a settlement in which the employer has little or no say.                
                

            
                In such a system, which already sounds like what the Obama administration is proposing for health care, the affected parties have little to do and, as a result, have little incentive to improve on the system. But there is an alternative, already in place, in certain parts of the country in which small- and medium-sized businesses are banding together into co-ops called self-insured groups, which are proving to be a good deal for employers and employees.                
                

            
                These self-insured groups, in which businesses pay in to a fund that is used to administer the program and to pay out claims, give employers more control, and more responsibility, over what goes on in their warehouses, on their shop floors and in their plants. The process of self-insurance requires, for economic reasons that business owners make safety work for them. By sharing risk, the businesses that participate in the self-insurance process can deliver the benefits mandated by law in ways that help rather than hurt the company’s bottom line. And, unlike the government model, in a way that helps keep costs under control.                
                

            
                In California, where problems with the workers’ compensation system are legendary, recent reforms pushed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger helped reduce costs in the short-run by nearly 60 percent. As soon as the reforms went into effect, however, the trial lawyers and other who benefit financial from the government model immediately started to put pressure on the politicians to start raising the costs again. Rather than buckle to the pressure, State Insurance Commission Steve Poizner, who wants to follow Schwarzenegger into the governor’s mansion, pointed to the self-insurance model as an instructive lesson of ways to make the government program work.
Critics say the self-insurance model is loaded with risk and that workers could suffer as a result. Those who utilize self-insurance disagree.                
                

            
                David Mitchell, who chairs the California Restaurant Mutual Benefit Corporation – the state’s largest self-insurance group – acknowledges the Schwarzenegger reforms were “invaluable.” But what has really made the difference for CRMBC, he says, is that “our employers are more involved.”                
                

            
                “We have reduced claims frequency, fought and won against fraud, helped employees in crisis and developed new technologies,” he says, adding that is makes for a better workplace all around. The government model, by contrast, does not really serve anyone well. Rising costs hurt businesses and that, in turn, hurts workers. The self-insurance model, because it operates based on real risk in which plan participants have an ownership stake, simply makes better sense – which makes it a model, not just for workers’ compensation reform, but for other types of insurance as well.

I still support Obama, but Democrats could be in trouble in November.
Coakley blew it as much as Brown won it – Democrats will learn and rebound in November.
Voters are scared – if the economy doesn’t improve soon, Democrats will pay in November.
It’s a clear rejection of Obama’s big-government solutions and how the Democrats’ are running the country – watch out in November.

Wall Steet Will Never Be Tamed By a Mere Politician,"On this anniversary of the failure of Lehman Brothers, President Obama is set to promise Americans that we will never again be laid waste by the speculative fevers of Wall Street. He is wrong. The nature of capitalism and of trading markets is that they are prone to excess, and the nature of politics is that no leader will ever choose to step in and squash an exuberant market. At such times, there is simply too much money on the table. Credit bubbles are like herpes; they never really disappear. There are ways in which the government can lean against these formidable truths, but it is highly unlikely that the regulatory overhaul under consideration will take us in that direction.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                With his administration buffeted by charges of overreaching and fiscal intemperance, Obama will give himself a much-needed pat on the back for having brought the economy back from the brink. He is right to laud the efforts of Fed Chair Bernanke and Treasury Secretaries Paulson and Geithner. Some of their approaches worked, others did not. But there is no question that bold measures were necessary to prop up credit markets and reassure investors, or that the economy is surely in a safer place today than it was six months ago. The stock market, that ultimate arbiter of expectations, has rallied 50% from the March lows, giving the nation a welcome boost of confidence, while corporations everywhere are reporting that demand is stabilizing. We are not out of the woods entirely, but at the least we’ve been handed flashlights.                
                

            
                Obama will also use the financial demolition derby that erupted a year ago to press for increased government oversight of banks and greater international cooperation. Unhappily, the administration is quickly using its political capital to further a health care bill that Americans neither want nor understand. Obama’s ability to follow through on contentious financial proposals is being weakened by the day.                
                

            
                Already any notion that our foreign friends will unite in this effort is being dashed by the varying interests of those with sizeable financial industries (Great Britain) and those without (France, Germany.) French President Sarkozy is hopping mad that his plans for tight control of bank CEO pay have not been embraced by the G-20. Since his country is to banking what the U.S. is to baguette production, one suspects Mr. Sarkozy is milking this topic for political advantage.
                
                

            
                At home, Congress does not will have the will to tackle the needed overhaul of our financial regulatory system; they have too much self-interest. The current structure has been described by former Treasury Undersecretary David Nason as having been “knit together over the last 75 years…We currently have five federal depository institution regulators, one federal securities regulator, one federal futures regulator and a state-based insurance regulatory system.” Earlier this year when the administration proposed some streamlining of this messy apparatus, (in the end only proposing eliminating the Office of Thrift Supervision) those in Congress charged with overseeing the various agencies screamed foul. Consider that in pursuing health care “reform,” the president doesn’t even dare demote state insurance regulators, even though allowing insurers to compete across state lines would enhance the much sought-after increased competition that supposedly necessitates the “public option.”                
                

            
                Meanwhile, the administration is attempting to give the Federal Reserve expanded powers to monitor risk levels in the economy. Not everyone in Congress is happy with this plan; the Senate Banking Committee is said to be favoring a council of regulators—a structure almost sure to be less effective. The concept is appealing, but we have seen time and time again that few see trouble brewing.                
                

            
                As it scrambles to plug oversight cavities that contributed to the financial collapse, the government has rightly focused on the largely unregulated and huge derivatives markets. It was, after all, credit-default swaps that led AIG to suck $180 billion from taxpayers. The proposals from Treasury Secretary Geithner avoided challenging the vested interests of those agencies responsible for the sector- calling on the CFTC and the SEC to work out the details. Good luck with that.                
                

            
                At the end, there are many reasons that the financial markets failed, only a few of which will be addressed by President Obama. He will not likely mention the contradictory charge given by Congress to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – shareholder-owned companies that were exhorted by Barney Frank and others to increase lending to borrowers with poor credit. He won’t focus on the performance of the credit rating agencies which pursued the luscious profits available by granting complex but ultimately faulty CDOs agreeable ratings. He won’t review the extinction of Glass-Steagall, which took place under the watchful eye of Larry Summers, and which allowed banks to become risk-taking institutions.                
                

            
                As this crisis melts into history, we will become increasingly careless of the issues which precipitated it in the first place – excess leverage being the most important. Just as we have become complacent about national security in the years that have passed since 9/11—what ever happened to all those proposals from the 9/11 Commission? – we will watch as Wall Street figures out another brilliant money-making plan that will become overblown and treacherous. Some would argue that the proposed gigantic deficits being generated by this government are already ginning up a future crash. Who will step in?

DR. KEITH ABLOW: A Psychiatrist's Advice for President Obama,"President Obama’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday night symbolically kicked off the 2012 Presidential campaign. I tuned in with what psychiatrists call a “third ear”—listening to myself listening, polling my gut for when it alerted me to true or false notes. In my office, it is this “third ear” that allows me to ask questions that get past a person’s more superficial stories, to the heart of that person. In other words, I was paying as much attention to whether I sensed the President believed what he was saying, as to whether I agreed with what he was saying.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I loathe lip service. I am more than two decades into a career based on detecting it and opposing it. Much of what I can offer patients is help finding the courage and faith to stop running from who they really are and what they really believe—to say what they mean and mean what they say. Authenticity is quite literally part of the cure for depression and anxiety, because self-deception and the manipulation of others are so dispiriting. They literally remove us from the healing power of God.                
                

            
                So, here’s what I heard Tuesday night: I heard a man reading a script, acting out a part. The words the President spoke about reducing our national debt, reining in the size of government and working collaboratively with both Republicans and Democrats sounded—to my third ear—like the words of an alcoholic who tells me that he won’t drink, that I should just believe him, even though that he can’t share any compelling insight (let alone a true moment of epiphany) as to why he started anesthetizing himself with booze to begin with, nor any compelling narrative as to why he now believes he has to be sober to walk the path ahead. In short, he sounded like a man with new words, but without the new perspective that would make them his own, and, thereby, make them either credible or moving.                
                

            
                It was all too ""add-water-and-stir"" for me. I would have had to be drunk myself to believe it.
This new fiscally-disciplined, job-focused, centrist, collaborative, entrepreneurial president arrives on the stage with no back story to explain the character “arc” he has traveled on the national stage.                 
                

            
                How did a man who used every iota of power at his disposal to champion bailouts, stimulus packages, 99 weeks of unemployment benefits, unions and health care reform, without accepting any real input from conservative voices, suddenly morph into a deficit hawk who believes we can’t get anywhere as a nation unless we get there together? How did a man who apologized for our nation’s shortcomings on trips abroad and who attended a church run by a man who said, “God damn America!” come to believe that we are a people that should embrace the core ideas of our Founding Fathers?                
                

            
                How did this happen? Why did it happen? When did it happen? If these questions cannot be answered clearly, then the only question that really matters is this: Did any of it really happen?
Might it be, instead, that the president is the same man he was two years ago? Might he be a politician who doesn’t feel compelled to share his genuine thoughts and beliefs with the electorate? Might he have assessed the mid-term elections and decided that the best chance he would have at maintaining power would be to repackage himself—for now? Isn’t the whole progressive agenda defined, in part, by taking steps toward government control of individuals, solidifying gains, taking cover when necessary, then taking more steps toward government control? Couldn’t that explain this add-water-and-stir conversion?                
                

            
                How can a leader who vows to veto any bill containing earmarks, say in the same speech that he will not retreat from his health reform legislation—which earmarks the disposable income of every American and directs it to the mandatory purchase of health insurance?                
                

            
                Why would he forecast in his speech that he intends to reorganize many government agencies, to make them more efficient, when he ballooned the TSA into the an inefficient collosus? Could it be that the reorganization he spoke of will be an opportunity for him to take one or two more steps in a direction consistent with the true divining rod that guides him?                
                

            
                As a psychiatrist, here’s my unsolicited advice to the president: Explain to the American people how and why you have changed your tone and agenda so dramatically. Share with us the moments of epiphany that convinced you that the path you so boldly took us on for two years was ill conceived. Make yourself believable so that we can believe we are worthy of more than manipulation.                
                

            
                Uh, one other thing. It’s really an aside, but I want to mention it. Stop appropriating Bill Clinton’s facial expressions and trying to make them your own. It can be distracting when one man tries to channel another, especially when the mask isn’t held perfectly in place.

"Teach Your Children, Don't Let Obama Do It","You can tell President Obama slipped in just under the wire and qualified as part of the Boomer generation. He takes the Crosby, Stills & Nash song “Teach Your Children” literally and he doesn’t ever tire of hearing himself talk.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Obama doesn’t have to worry about Avian flu or H1N1, he’s infected with enough narcissism that there’s little room for anything else. His weekly address on health care on August 22 mentioned the word “I” eight times – debunking “‘phony claims’ about health reform.” The week before when he talked about health care, he said “I” 12 times. He even quoted Kennedy using first person.                  
                

            
                He’s not content with having the media endlessly talk about him. He has to do it himself.

But his warm-up speech is a bit of liberal indoctrination to school kids the day before.  Sure the president has to speak. But he’s also supposed to shut up sometime.                 
                

            
                And he’s also not supposed to take advantage of the ultimate in captive audiences and harangue little kids to be good little Democrats. Republicans, who have enough trouble recruiting the iTunes generation, are naturally miffed.                 
                

            
                Because it’s not just Obama being broadcast to schools around the country like we’re in some little tin-pot, third-world dictatorship. (You can bet Hugo Chavez is asking himself why he didn’t think of this.) No, this little exercise in paternalistic government comes complete with a lesson plan that was so controversial that White House aides helped decide what should be our Department of Education rewrite them. No matter what they finally say, it has all become part of the president’s perpetual campaign team.                 
                

            
                The Education Dept., which already is controlled by the worst union on earth, the National Education Association, wants even more control. Oh, and more money of course. So they are throwing their ample weight behind the man so many teachers admire and voted for – Obama.                 
                

            
                So Obama is reaching out to kids with a lesson plan that includes teachers urging students to read books about this president, or having them “write letter to themselves” about his speech – though somehow those letters are later to be shared with others. It’s hard to imagine a more blatant attempt to politicize the school system to boost a failing presidency.                
                

            
                Funny how the education push occurs just after reports that a “popular president’s strong stances on education issues can shift the public perception of those issues,” according to an Education Week story on a new national survey. Obama wouldn’t be playing politics with kindergartners and grade schoolers, would he?                
                

            
                It’s not like children are kept out of politics by team Obama. There’s the “Yes We Can” video by the Black Eyed Peas that shows a parade of mindless Hollywood celebs chanting “Yes we can” like they had just spent all summer at cult camp. That only targeted young people. Another video of children wearing “Imagine Hope” T-shirts looks more like it was smuggled out of a Dear Leader celebration from North Korea.                
                

            
                And Obama abused a recent interview he had with a young student. Obama used the young journalist for softball questions much like he uses the major media. The YouTube video had nearly half a million views of this little bit of big government propaganda about all the good things his administration is doing to help education. In it, the president listed several ways parents can teach their children. The recommendations included reading aloud to children and helping them with their homework. But he left out one key thing – not to let your children be indoctrinated.                 
                

            
                Smart minds in the conservative movement want parents to pull their kids out of Tuesday’s little bit of indoctrination. That’s not enough.                
                

            
                Obama proves conservatives need to go further than that. This stunt should serve as a larger reminder that this kind of manipulation of young people occurs every day in America at the hands of the NEA. Conservatives for too long have fought little skirmishes against the outlandish biases coming from the uber left who control a huge portion of our children’s waking hours.                
                

            
                That needs to stop. Conservatives of all stripes – social conservatives, libertarians, Christian conservatives and more – all need to unify to stop government from manipulating our young people. The promise of education is an important one. How we deliver it needs to change.                
                

            
                It’s time for conservatives to not just lobby for a few charter schools or a tiny tax break. Conservatives need to push to defund the government-controlled school system and replace it with true school choice. Give parents the money and let them choose the best schools for their children. Stop letting NEA automatons decide how many times to watch Al Gore’s “Inconvenient Truth” or how much sex education fourth graders should have.                
                

            
                Obama has reminded conservatives that there is a better answer for his version of public education. To quote another White House veteran from better days: “Just say no.”

What I Saw at a Health Care Forum,"I urge members of the Obama administration to step off the health care stage and into the crowd, that Ã¢â‚¬Å“angry mob"" they refer to is a growing number of Americans who want to slow down and take part in the health care debate.  One step off the podium will show them this is anything but an Ã¢â‚¬Å“astroturf effort.""  This is zoyzia, it's real, it's hearty, and can tolerate the heat.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This week the chairman of the Blue Dog Democrats health care task force, Rep. Mike Ross (D-Ark.) along with  Rep. Vic Snyder (D-Ark.) faced some harsh critics at a health care forum in Arkansas.  Passionate voters said Washington has turned a deaf ear for too long, and they're forced to turn up the volume.                
                

            
                Critics shouted their concerns about losing control of their health care choices. One urged Congress to vote down any public option health plan, saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“we need to open it up to the free market and get the government the hell out of it.""                
                

            
                Over the past week, members of Congress have faced  heated protests from New York to the City of Brotherly love from Connecticut to the Lone Star State.  Democrats dismiss these confrontations as feigned outrage, saying politicians are being heckled by tea-baggers and angry Republicans.                  
                

            
                While there are members of groups such as the TEA Party, Americans for Prosperity, Campaign for Liberty, Conservatives for Patients' Rights, and Freedom Works at these events, they are by no means the majority.                
                

            
                Most town hall attendees are hard working, freedom loving people who say they're scared at the prospect of a government run health care.  These are people who have taken the time to read the 1,000+ page health care bill and don't like what they see.  They are common sense people who say if it's good enough for us, it should be good enough for our elected officials.                
                

            
                These are not rabid extremists' who are trying to de-rail health care reform, they are offering solutions.  Constituents are telling their Congressmen any health care plan must be deficit neutral, allow patients to choose their doctors, include tort reform, wipe out waste and fraud in the current system, place a greater emphasis on patient improvement, and health care plans must be portable.                
                

            
                In a video released by the Democratic National Committee, they attribute town hall turnouts to Ã¢â‚¬Å“desperate Republicans and their well-funded allies"" who are out to Ã¢â‚¬Å“destroy President Obama.""                
                

            
                Well-funded allies?                
                

            
                This forum included a soccer mom who was concerned about health care for her four children if her husband lost his job, a small business owner who would be unable to compete with a taxpayer-funded public option, and a grandmother who questioned why she would have to change the coverage she needs to pay for coverage someone else doesn't want.                
                

            
                Obama Spokesman Robert Gibbs refers to the critics as ""Brooks Brothers Brigade"" who blanketed Florida after the 2000 presidential election.  He encouraged people to Ã¢â‚¬Å“take a jaundiced eye to what is clearly the AstroTurf nature of so-called grassroots lobbying.""

In a fundraising e-mail, former President Bill Clinton called out Republicans for efforts behind what he calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“the most powerful special interests in Washington who've launched a furious campaign to preserve the status quo.""                
                

            
                Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said nothing could be further from the truth.                
                

            
                Ã¢â‚¬Å“We're not inciting anyone to go out and disrupt anything,"" said Steele. Ã¢â‚¬Å“To sit back and say this is a Republican cabal is a bunch of baloney.""                
                

            
                I find it interesting that Democrats have also gone after these conservative political groups for posting times and locations of town hall forums on their Web sites, and encouraging people to attend.  The president has done the same thing.                
                

            
                In an e-mail to 13 million people, the president encouraged supporters to commit to attending at least one health care event this month in support of his plan.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is the moment our movement was built for,"" President Obama wrote.                
                

            
                Actually, Mr. President, this is the moment our country was built for.  A time for all Americans to stand up for what they believe in.  A time for our leaders to listen.                  
                

            
                There's nothing artificial about that.

What Was It Reid Said That Was So Offensive?,"Reuters
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                As if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid didn't have enough on his plate—trying to find sufficient cash to buy the 60 votes necessary for his health-care reform package—he's now found himself at the center of a race controversy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In their new book, ""Game Change,"" journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann expose remarks Mr. Reid made in an interview about Barack Obama during the presidential campaign. Mr. Reid is quoted as saying that he believed the nation was ready to elect a ""light-skinned"" black man ""with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.""                
                

            
                Confronted with this quote, Mr. Reid apologized on Saturday: ""I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words. I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans, for my improper comments.""                
                

            
                What followed this public apology was all too predictable. Mr. Reid personally called President Obama and a handful of presumed leaders of the so-called African-American community—Julian Bond, Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson among them—to beg forgiveness for his racial sin.
To no one's surprise, all of those to whom apologies were extended responded by accepting Mr. Reid's apology and saying that the nation had more important issues to deal with, such as health care and national security.                
                

            
                As I have observed coverage of this incident by the media and captains of the African-American community, I cannot help but be reminded of former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who made remarks praising Strom Thurmond in 2002. Mr. Lott said of the segregationist: ""When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we [Mississippians] voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years either.""                
                

            
                When Mr. Lott's controversy erupted, he apologized repeatedly and sincerely to one and all—even groveling on Black Entertainment Network—all to no avail. Black leaders were unforgiving and persisted in demanding that he either resign from his position or be removed. In the end, they got what they wanted.                
                

            
                When Rush Limbaugh wanted to buy into the St. Louis Rams last year, many of the same individuals who instantly accepted Mr. Reid's apology expressed outrage over allegedly racist statements made by Mr. Limbaugh, despite the fact that zero evidence of these statements existed. They demanded that his participation in the bid be rejected. Ultimately, they got what they wanted.                
                

            
                It's certainly true that racial incidents are not all created equal. What one individual finds offensive may not be to another. Thus, the words of Mr. Lott may have been more insensitive to some than the comments of Mr. Reid. Nonetheless, it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the spirit of forgiveness is universal—except when it comes to conservatives.                
                

            
                For my part, I am having a difficult time determining what it was that Mr. Reid said that was so offensive.

                As President Obama sets off on his “Betting On America” bus tour through the key swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio, both the Obama and Romney campaigns are anxiously awaiting the numbers from Friday's monthly jobs report. As they wait, it's clear that the Supreme Court's ruling last week to uphold ObamaCare will not be enough to reelect the president in 2012.   
   
 To be sure, President Obama now finds himself in a slightly stronger position vis-à-vis Mitt Romney than he was just a few weeks ago – with the latest Real Clear Politics average showing the him enjoying a narrow 2.6 point (47.0 percent to 44.4 percent) lead over Mitt Romney.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                And any lingering doubts that the ruling presented a clear short-term win for the President and the Democratic leadership were resolved during  Monday’s television appearance by Romney senior campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom, who argued on MSNBC that the mandate is a penalty, not a tax – breaking with congressional Republicans in the process.                   
                

            
                But notwithstanding the confusion and division that developed within the GOP in the wake of the Supreme Court's surprise verdict to uphold Obama's health care reform  law, there is no sense that either candidate’s overall political standing has changed.                
                

            
                Recent polling shows clearly and unambiguously that the former Massachusetts Governor remains within striking distance of the president – whose vulnerability in the polls became clearer and clearer over the course of the week.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                Here's why:  President Obama’s job approval rating is well below the crucial fifty percent mark in the latest polling by Gallup(45%-47% disapproval), and Rasmussen  (46%- 53% disapproval), and the latest Real Clear Politics average has the president with a net negative approval rating (47.6% - 48.3%).                
                

            
                These findings are consistent with the results in a new Newsweek/Daily Beast poll, conducted by my polling firm, Douglas E. Schoen, LLC. immediately following the Supreme Court ruling – in which a solid majority (54%) of voters said they disapproved of President Obama’s overall job performance, a plurality of voters said it is time to replace him with someone else (48%), and only 42% said he has done his job well enough to deserve reelection.
 
 Moreover, voters told us that Governor Romney would do a better job on handling virtually every single domestic policy measure than President Obama – including the economy (52%-37%), illegal immigration (41%-38%), health care (48%-40%), balancing the budget (48%-44%), fighting crime (35%-33%), and holding the line on taxes (45%-42%).                
                

            
                The fact that the president got no real bounce at all from the Supreme Court's ruling and saw no fundamental change in his approval ratings – even while a solid majority (58%) of voters see  the Supreme Court decision as a major political win for Obama and while only 19% see it as a win for Romney, and 23% are unsure --  indicates the profound disquiet American voters feel with current economic circumstances.                
                

            
                These findings underscore the real and fundamental political problem that President Obama and indeed both parties face -- the economy.                
                

            
                Put simply,  when voters head to the polls come November, their decision will hinge on jobs, housing and other economic indicators – not health care.                  
                

            
                Having suffered in the polls following the poor job figures for March, April, and May, the only way the president can turn these numbers around is to demonstrate real leadership on fiscal issues.                        
                

            
                Friday, the Labor Department will release the job report for June.  Stay tuned."
Socialized Medicine Is Not a Fundamental Right,"President Obama and his political team -- starring David Axelrod, Rahm Emmanuel, and Robert Gibbs -- will begin a full court press with the American public today to sell their $1 trillion dollar plan to drastically increase government involvement in, and control over, the nation's health care industry. The president will do interviews today with medical reporters/commentators from NBC News , ABC News, and CBS News -- all broadcast networks and great cheerleaders of socialized medicine.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Here's what to watch out for: a mucking up of ethical waters by the inference that the fundamental human right to basic health care is equivalent to a universal ""right"" to socialized medicine. In the coming days the president and his advisers will speak passionately, and often, about the estimated 46 million Americans without health care insurance. And they will do so in moralistic terms, haranguing Americans to feel outrage at the thought of so many poor, fellow citizens deprived of their rights.                
                

            
                And if this were true, if 46 million Americans had no access to basic health care, the outrage would be justified and political action would be morally compulsory. But it's not true.                 
                

            
                In fact, not a single group, class, or economic bracket in the United States of America, including illegal immigrants, can claim that this right has been denied them. The poor in America are already serviced remarkably (though inefficiently) by massive government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.                 
                

            
                Emergency rooms in both public and private hospitals will attend to anyone in urgent need. Most of the 46 million people who do not have health insurance are middle class Americans who have opted out of purchasing it because of other financial priorities. Is this ideal? No, it's not. It would be ideal is no oneever had to make such a choice. But we do not live in an ideal world and the freedom to establish our own financial priorities, as good or bad as they may be, is also a right that must be protected.                
                

            
                In summary, there is certainly a need for health care reform. But let's be clear: there is no such thing as a fundamental human right to socialized medicine.                
                

            
                God bless,

Are the Big Guns In the Health Care Debate Afraid of Obama?,"Mon, 11 May 2009 19:44:29 +0000 –  By Tevi TroyVisiting Senior Fellow, The Hudson Institute/Former Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                President Obama has brought health care stakeholders to the White House again, this time to announce $2 trillion in putative cost savings to our health care system. These savings seem to solve a political problem for the White House, which has been on the hunt for ways to pay for its health care reform, which will likely cost twice as much as the $634 billion the White House put into the budget for that purpose. However, it's not at all clear that these savings will develop. ""Future savings,"" are often promised in health care, but rarely develop. Still, this move may allow Congress and the White House to claim that they are reforming health care without busting the budget any further than they already have.                
                

            
                -----------------------                 
                

            
                
 Are health care stakeholders worried about their futures under President Obama?
                
                

            
                What's more telling, tough, is the stakeholders who came forward with the savings. It's clear that these stakeholders -- including the American Hospital Association, American Medical Association, Pharma, AdvaMed, America's Health Insurance Plans, the Greater New York hospital association and the California Hospital association -- are extremely nervous about where they will end up relative to their colleagues should the president secure the kind of major health reform he is seeking. These stakeholders have clearly decided that fighting reform is a fruitless struggle, and that they had better get on the ship before it sails. Their collective boarding will put additional pressure on each of the stakeholders going forward. If any group does not come forward with their promised savings, they may find their current allies only too happy to push them overboard."
U. Maryland Students Show Up for Obama-- not Health Care Reform,"Editor's note: This is the campus perspective provided by our partners at UWire.com. The author Joel Cohen is a student at the University of Maryland.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                College Park, Md. — If a law had the potential to directly affect your life while costing the nation a smidge less than a trillion dollars, would you pay attention? Of course.                
                

            
                Then why are college kids oblivious to the details of President Obama’s push to reform health care?                
                

            
                After attending Thursday’s health care rally at the University of Maryland, the student attendees generally were enthralled with being in the presence of the president — and could have seemingly cared less about what he was talking about.                
                

            
                Sure, the president gave his pitch to the friendly crowd on the liberal campus. He stressed the notion that under his plan, young adults would be able to stay on their parents’ health insurance plan until age 26 (maybe because, as my friend joked, there won’t be any jobs available for graduates in the near future…). And he dismissed opponents’ arguments that his plan would add to the debt, saying “most of this plan can be paid for by finding savings within the existing health care system.”                
                

            
                But as I walked around soliciting students’ opinions of Obama’s health plan, few could explain in detail specific reasons why they liked it or why it was a necessary reform even though they’re at the heart of 18 to 29 demographic, which polls show is the most supportive group of the legislation.                
                

            
                Even fewer students could describe details of the public option proposal-- despite the fact that they had vehemently cheered for just that minutes before.                
                

            
                “The bill seems so complicated, I don’t even want to try to figure it out,” said Mike Moore. The University of Maryland junior government and politics major added that his statistics class is more than enough decoding for one day.                
                

            
                Now don’t get me wrong: there were some students who understood the plan, such as Michelle McGrain. “My mom’s in the health care field, so she’s seen the problems firsthand,” said the junior University of Maryland student. “While Obama’s plan isn’t perfect, from what I’ve see, it’s a start.”                
                

            
                But students like Michelle were few and far between.                
                

            
                And experts say our generation is effectively getting screwed by the bill, as we’re being forced to buy insurance even though we’re relatively healthy, to subsidize older Americans’ plans.                
                

            
                “Young people are probably one of the groups that’s going to come out the worst on this,” Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told the Los Angeles Times. “They’re going to pay more in the short term because they’re going to have to go out and buy health insurance. And they’re going to pay more in the long term.”                
                

            
                Despite our naiveté, I was impressed by the steps Obama is taking to include college students in the discussion.                
                

            
                According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 17 percent of college students do not have insurance. Some universities, currently 22 percent, including the University of Maryland, have enacted rules requiring mandatory health insurance for all incoming freshman-- a fact Obama discussed in his speech. And by including the provision that college students’ coverage will extended beyond graduation, he has shown that he is committed to improving our situation.                
                

            
                But it was obvious that students and other guests at today’s rally weren’t interested in seeing a health care speech, rather, they were more interested in positioning themselves for that elusive presidential handshake."

Sen. Rand Paul's 'Read the Bills Act' - Is it really too much to ask members of Congress to read legislation before they vote on it?,"The median family income for a family of four in the United States these days is approximately $56,500. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate earn $179,000 annually. Each chamber’s leadership makes even more: $193,400. For this kind of money, taxpayers -- who pay these salaries -- might expect their elected representative to do their jobs.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                They don’t.
                
                


                
            
                Legislators are paid to … well, legislate. Legislating means crafting policy proposals, meeting with constituents, holding legislative hearings, and, ultimately, voting. High school students who come to Washington, D.C., still get copies of that perennial civics favorite, “How A Bill Becomes A Law.” But that brochure never discloses the reality of the American legislative process and how it differs significantly from that cheerful civics description.
                
                


                
            
                That situation is what prompted Senator Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, to again propose legislation, timed just as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a new GOP-sponsored health-care-reform bill, mandating that Senators first read legislation before they vote on it. If you are an elected representative, shouldn’t there be a presumption that before you decide how to vote, you actually know what you’re voting on? It’s not acceptable for members just to be told by their party’s Whip how they should vote as they enter the chamber.
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            One of the more revealing comments in this regard was made by then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who was commenting on the proposed Affordable Care Act. She remarkably said that, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” 
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
            
                The “Read the Bills Act"" was first proposed in 2006. Senator Paul endorsed it in 2010 and proposed similar legislation in June 2012. If enacted, the bill would not only promote greater transparency in government by requiring that bills be posted publicly at least 72 hours before a vote, but it would also most certainly produce legislation that was clearer, more coherent, and much shorter.
                
                


                
            
                The new Senate Republican health care proposal is 142 pages long. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, on June 22 whether he had read the new proposal. Senator Cornyn held up the bound text, said that he hadn’t yet read it, but announced that given its relative brevity, he planned to read the bill that evening. By contrast, the Obama administration’s 2010 Affordable Care Act contained some 2,700 pages, roughly the length of Marcel Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time,” one of the longest novels ever written. How many elected officials read that bill?
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Is it really asking too much of our well-paid public servants in Washington to take the time to read and understand legislation before they vote on it? One of the more revealing comments in this regard was made by then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who was commenting on the proposed Affordable Care Act. She remarkably said that, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” At least she was being candid.
                
                


                
            
                Pelosi’s remark, however, stands in sharp contrast to what Congress expects from others. For example, the 2003 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (intended to protect investors from fraudulent accounting practices) requires that chief executives and chief financial officers of publicly traded companies certify with each quarterly-earnings report that they have read their report and that it is accurate. Failure to do so can result in stiff civil penalties and, under certain circumstances, criminal liability. A health-care bill that impacts nearly 18 percent of the country’s gross domestic product has the potential for creating far more harm than almost any corporate quarterly earnings report imaginable.
                
                


                
            
                So why do so many members of Congress not take the time to read bills before they vote? It’s probably not because they are lazy. These men and women are typically Type A, driven individuals. It’s probably not because they are stupid or have short attention spans. You don’t get to serve in Congress -- at least for very long -- if you are intellectually challenged.
                
                


                
            
                The answer is much simpler: they don’t have enough time. And the one reason they don’t have enough time is because they spend an inordinate amount of their time dialing for dollars to fund their next reelection campaign. Some members of Congress have confessed to spending more than 40 percent of their time raising money. American taxpayers, in effect, are subsidizing nonstop electioneering in a manner that precludes their elected representatives from doing their real jobs.
                
                


                
            
                We need an overhaul of how our Congress works, and we can start by mandating that members certify that they have read legislation before they vote on it. Perhaps a more comprehensive bill, the “Making Congress Work for the American People Act,” (with “Work” having more than one meaning) should be considered – a bill that addresses the multiple dysfunctions of our Congress. This legislation could include: (1) banning all fundraising by members whenever Congress is in session, (2) withholding pay from all members if appropriations bills are not completed on time, (3) posting all legislation publicly at least 72 hours before a vote, (4) using technology to track changes in the legislative drafting process to allow more public scrutiny and accountability, (5) extending the Congressional workweek beyond what has now become a routine three days, and (6) having fewer and shorter Congressional recesses.
                
                


                
            
                Something tells me that members of Congress would read every word of this proposed bill. When traditional American pragmatism and common sense merge with today’s resurgent populism on the left and the right, it is likely that members of Congress will change their ways and start delivering for the American people and not just for themselves.

The Irony of Reconciliation,"Democrats’ response to Republican objections to using reconciliation to pass health care reform should be clear: enjoy the deja vu. After all, GOP objectors could not be more fundamentally hypocritical.

According to the Brookings Institution, reconciliation bills were passed by Congress 22 times between 1980 and 2008. Republicans controlled the Senate for 18 of those years (1981-1987, 1995-2007) and controlled the House for 14 (1995-2007). Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Acts in 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1990 were all passed by split majorities, and all brought major changes to federal expenditures, including both spending outlays and reductions. All were signed by the President—first Ronald Reagan, then George H.W. Bush.

Even when party control was divided between the houses of Congress as well as between the executive and legislative branches of government, reconciliation was seen as a way to demonstrate progress to the American people. When asked under what circumstances the GOP would work with a Democratic chief executive, Republican leaders often cite their leadership on welfare reform during the contentious 1990s. Called the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996, welfare reform was enacted via -- you guessed it -- reconciliation by a GOP-led Congress and signed into law by President Clinton.

There were also three GOP-initiated uses of reconciliation during the two terms of President George W. Bush—in 2001, 2003 and 2005. None, sadly, were revenue- or budget-neutral. Indeed, since the bills brought a tax windfall to the top 1% of American income earners yet were not accompanied by cuts in spending, the reconciliation-generated laws boosted federal debt by nearly $1 trillion.

The GOP argument against using reconciliation for health care reform is that medicine, insurance and the American people’s health is too important, too monumental, to be left to a 51-seat Senate majority. But were the federal deficits of the 1980s not monumental? Was welfare reform, which altered the lives of tens of millions of Americans, not monumental?

No, what we really have is the Republican minority making hay out of a straw issue. They would have a lot more credibility if they honestly told the American people that they support reconciliation when they favor bills and do not support it when they don't. At least they would therefore be straightforward in their hypocrisy.

Meanwhile, the irony of reconciliation itself is that little is actually reconciled between the political parties -- beyond the usual prescription of bitterness, agitation and obstructionism that leaves the American people furious at government and worse off than before. The GOP and the Tea Party members can distort polls however they wish; they can subdivide their ranks (what with the likes of William Bennett and Mark Levin voicing concerns about Glenn Beck's speech to the CPAC convention) to their heart's content. With the right-wing eager to make gains in the midterm elections, perhaps it's unreasonable to expect the GOP to own up to its past on reconciliation.

But history -- unlike political parties -- will not lie.                                            ADVERTISEMENT

"Don't Celebrate Too Much, Republicans, Get to Work","Republicans are set to take control of the House today in a much needed change of power that comes to at least one of our legislative branches. But the celebration on the right will be short lived. They’ll need to immediately get to work making good on the promises they made.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                First and foremost: repealing Obamacare. But it will be a delicate dance. And like many shows that involve dancing these days, a couple of wrong steps and Republicans could get voted off.                
                

            
                While liberals scream bloody murder about this vote being “strictly symbolic” and it ""going nowhere"" (because of a Democratically controlled Senate that will never bring the repeal of Obamacare to the floor and a president in the White House packing a powerful veto pen) the GOP ran on a platform of eliminating this costly and massive new entitlement. They must keep their word. And, a majority of Americans still favor repeal of the health care law, so they are correct to vote to overturn it.                
                

            
                Since its passage, the health care law has been ridden with nothing but problems (like increased premiums, to take one example) a prediction that was made by critics made long before the bill was signed into law.                 
                

            
                The benefits from Obamacare don’t kick in till 2014, but the costs – but financial and otherwise—are causing pain already. This gives those on the political right plenty of reasons to revisit the bill. Plus, Rep. Daryl Issa is planning hearings on the costs associated with Obamacare and hopefully, the process. This is a good idea. For example, what deals went down between the White House, big Pharma and the unions to get their special carve outs? Was political support promised? And what about policy proposals like end of life care (aka: “death panels”) that most assuredly the government favors as a cost containment mechanism. What is the truth to their legitimacy? We have a right to know.                
                

            
                While repeal of Obamacare is good, the GOP must be prepared to offer a replacement bill. It should be one that includes a provision that allows patients to buy insurance across state lines, includes tort reform to curb sky-high malpractice costs, and AHAs (associated health plans) so businesses can buy more cost effective health care.                 
                

            
                The plan that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) offered during the health care summit at the White House was a great start. It should be their template for real, sensible reform.                
                

            
                While Republicans have an opportunity to use health care reform as an opposition tool, they must also be careful to not let the same fate that struck the Democrats repeat itself: being so obsessed with heath care while jobs is the number one issue to most Americans. The GOP cannot afford to look as distracted as the Democrats did while unemployment lines grew and grew. Taming big, costly, in-your-face government is a great message, but the economy must be first and foremost.                
                

            
                The political reality is that the next two years may be a public relations fight between parties. It's one that will hinge on how the economy performs, and who ends up on the top of the Republican ticket.                 
                

            
                Remember, if the GOP really wants to repeal Obamacare, it must return the White House to Republican hands. In the meantime, it's up to House Republicans to return to their core values by passing sensible legislation that will embarras Democrats, stand firm on serious spending cuts (despite the political pain) and present a clear cut case for why Democrats’ goal of big, gangster government is a loser. If they fail, they’ll be the ones earning that title.

              Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Mitch McConnell, in public, says he wants to pass a health care reform plan that repeals ObamaCare. Remember, McConnell says he wants to scrap ObamaCare “root and branch.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But behind the scenes, McConnell has been working over liberal senators to assure them his plan will not actually scrap the Medicaid expansion and that he will undermine Senator Ted Cruz’s amendment to provide individual freedom in health care choices.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              McConnell, again and again, stacks the deck against conservatives, setting them up to be the fall guy for his own failures.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The president’s various nominees are on the slow walk through McConnell’s Senate, where the filibuster no longer applies.

              ObamaCare repeal is just about dead, even though it cannot be filibustered either.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              Tax reform is dead on arrival.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The entirety of the GOP agenda is stuck in the Senate where Mitch McConnell seems intent to let it all die on the vine while blaming conservatives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It is time for the Senate GOP to replace Mitch McConnell so that President Trump can actually get some of his legislative policies advanced. It is not conservatives who are the obstacle, but the Senate leader himself.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Mr. President, instead of considering a challenge to Jeff Flake, it might be time to send McConnell to the pasture.

The Madness of King Barack,"On December 16, 1773, several dozen colonists in Boston, angered by King George’s financially ruinous tea tax, took action into their own hands. Dressed as Mohawk Indians, they snuck onto 3 British tea ships and dumped over 300 chests of tea into Boston Harbor. That revolt was said to have sparked the American Revolution.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Last night, the state of Massachusetts was the site of yet another revolt, only this time it was Attorney General Martha Coakley, the Democratic Party, and President Obama, health care and health care reform that were thrown into the drink, following the stunning election of Republican Scott Brown to the U.S. Senate.                
                

            
                Yet on the eve of the election, the White House suggested to Politico’s Mike Allen that they would not moderate the president’s policies, but in a fit of madness akin to King George’s, would double down and strike a more combative tone.                
                

            
                I have a feeling that over the next few days, the White House will want to talk to Mike Allen and amend their remarks.                
                

            
                As evidenced by the quotes listed below, aside from DCCC chairman Chris Van Hollen’s “blame Bush” comment, most of the President’s loyalists aren’t so anxious for the call to arms:                
                

            
                ""Regardless of the outcome ... this should be a gigantic wake-up call to the Democratic Party - that we're not connecting with the needs, the aspirations and the desires of real people right now.""

""President George W. Bush and House Republicans drove our economy into a ditch and tried to run away from the accident.""
- Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland)                
                

            
                “Suspend further votes on health care legislation until Senator-elect Brown is seated.”
-Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.)                
                

            
                ""It’s not the end of the world. Look, we can come back to healthcare. It wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world to step back and say, look, we’re going to pivot to do a jobs thing. We’re going to try to include some healthcare pieces in it.""
-Rep. Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.)                
                

            
                “I have no interest in sugar coating what happened in Massachusetts. There is a lot of anxiety in the country right now. Americans are understandably impatient. The truth is Democrats understand the economic anger voters feel, that’s in large part why we did well in 2006 and 2008.
-Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Chmn., DSCC                
                

            
                In response to the tea party protest, King George passed the ‘Coercive Acts,’ which was every bit as punishing as it sounds. Will King Barack respond to the election of Scott Brown in Massachusetts with moderation and scrap health care or with madness and shove a coercive bill down America’s collective throats?

              While there is far more to be done, President Trump has the right idea on health care reform.  The low hanging fruit is strategic deregulation, specifically rolling back the ACA-imposed requirements on health insurance that not only directly raised insurance premiums but furthered the inappropriate construct that insurance should minimize out-of-pocket payment for all medical care.  When insurance covers nearly everything, patients have little incentive to consider price of care, so doctors and hospitals don’t need to compete on price. The consequences are the overuse of health care and unrestrained costs.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The president’s directive will allow more insurance choices for millions of people who don’t want to buy bloated coverage filled with mandates for care they do not value and will not use. Part of this is the opportunity to buy insurance from other states and without the burden of ObamaCare’s “essential benefits” that increased premiums by almost 10 percent, and many of the 2,270 state coverage mandates for everything from acupuncture to marriage therapy. This will generate cheaper insurance.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Even more importantly, less comprehensive coverage and more widespread availability of high deductible plans will expose patients to paying directly for care. By doing so, patients will incorporate price into health care decisions, a lever critical to reducing the price of medical care itself. And the price of medical care is the major determinant of insurance premiums, the major factor in government health expenditures, and the major obstacle to health care.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Could people consider price for medical care? Yes - almost 60 percent of all expenditures by privately insured adults under age 65 is for elective outpatient care, and these are amenable to price-conscious purchasing.  Even for the top one percent of spenders who spend for more than 25 percent of all health spending, a full 45 percent is for outpatient care. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Additionally, the president noted the goal of expanding and deregulating tax-sheltered accounts. Employer provided HRAs (Health Reimbursement Arrangement) and independent HSAs (Health Saings Account) motivate patients to consider price, because account holders keep the money they don’t spend. These accounts are better than tax deductions, because they incentivize saving. Spending of patients with high deductible health plans paired with HSAs decreased at least 15 percent annually in a March 2015 study. When people have savings to protect in HSAs, the cost of care comes down without harmful impact on health. To maximize downward pressure on prices, HSAs should be also be available to seniors on Medicare, the most frequent users of health care. Raising maximum contributions, permitting tax-sheltered rollovers to surviving family members, and allowing HSA payments for the expenses of the holder’s elderly parents would also be significant deregulatory steps.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For patients to effectively seek out the best value for their money, more reforms must also occur.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              First, the visibility of information that patients require for assessing value must be radically improved.  We know that price transparency encourages price comparisons by patients for outpatient care like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outpatient surgery.  Doctors and hospitals would certainly post prices and qualifications once they are competing for price-conscious patients empowered with control of the money.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Second, the supply of medical care must also be strategically increased.  We need to remove anti-competitive scope-of-practice limits on nurse practitioners and physician assistants, because they provide effective primary care that is 30 to 40 percent cheaper than that provided by doctors.  Additionally, about two-thirds of the 2025 projected doctor shortage of 124,000 will be in specialists, yet medical societies have maintained protectionist training program limits that restrict competition. Meanwhile, medical schools have prevented any increase in graduation numbers for almost 40 years. These longstanding anti-consumer practices should at least be opened to public scrutiny.  Simultaneously, archaic obstacles to competition among medical care providers must be eliminated, like state certificate-of-need requirements for installing competitive medical technology.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Third, introduce the right incentives into the tax code and eliminate the harmful, counterproductive incentives of  the current tax code. Today’s unlimited income exclusion from taxes for employer-provided health benefits encouraged higher demand for care, regardless of cost, while distorting insurance into covering almost all services. Likewise, artificially propping up high insurance premiums for bloated coverage that minimizes out-of-pocket payment via subsidies or tax credits prevents patients from caring about price. This reduces incentives for doctors to compete on price.  Any new tax reform should cap health care deductions and limit eligibility to catastrophic premiums and HSA contributions to incentivize patients to consider prices.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We know that focusing on increasing the number of people with health insurance by expanding government programs and subsidizing premiums is an ill-conceived approach that caused skyrocketing insurance premiums, fewer insurance options, and markedly fewer doctors accepting the insurance.  We also know that countries with single payer health care hold down costs by limiting the use of health care, with the expected long waits and worse medical outcomes, particularly for the poor and middle class who cannot circumvent those systems. Instead, America’s reforms should focus on reducing the price of medical care itself without restricting its use or creating obstacles to new drugs and technology.  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The key is to incentivize and equip consumers to consider price; strategically increase the supply of medical care to stimulate competition; and introduce the right incentives into the tax code. This is the best pathway to broaden access to high quality care for all Americans.

Jennifer Korn: The Truth About Immigration Reform,"In a radio interview Tuesday, Vice President Biden said, “he and the President are breaking their necks trying to get immigration reform”. Someone will need to let the Vice-President know that what President Obama in fact broke, was his promise to Hispanics on immigration reform and is once again using the issue to pander to our community.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In the modern era, two presidents have tackled immigration reform. They were Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush—both conservatives. Plenty of liberal presidents have come and gone, but failed to champion immigration reform. Consider Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama – nada! In fact, to make matters worse, President Obama leveraged the issue in 2008 to win over Hispanics. But then, once elected, he broke his promise, shattering the dreams of many hardworking immigrants.                
                

            
                While working in the White House for President George W. Bush, I saw first-hand his unwavering commitment to achieving a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform and his leadership in the pursuit of it, even when it was politically unpopular with some members of his own party. In contrast, President Obama did not even try to work with leaders from both parties to fix our broken immigration system despite the fact that he enjoyed the benefits of working with a Democrat-controlled Congress during his first two years in the White House.                
                

            
                President Bush’s marching orders were clear. We held weekly meetings with a bipartisan coalition of groups from various sectors, including the business, agriculture, civil rights, and religious communities. We listened, collected their input, and shared our ideas with them. President Bush sent two of his Cabinet Secretaries to Capitol Hill to help draft legislation; and he was the only president ever to deliver a national address on immigration from the Oval Office. Now that is commitment.                
                

            
                President Obama often says that he is ”committed to immigration reform,” but saying those words repeatedly don’t make it so. Let. Me. Be. Clear: President Obama has not drafted any immigration reform legislation. When he says those words, what he really means is ”I am committed to it, so Congress now you go and do it.” That is not leadership; and that does not get important issues moving in Congress.                
                

            
                Immigration reform is a complicated issue; as such, it requires both leadership and commitment from the Executive. The President’s excuse for his inaction is that no Republicans would vote for his plan. What plan? You cannot vote on legislation that does not exist. News flash: speeches alone don’t cut it.                
                

            
                Remember when he told us, during a May 2008 interview with Univision’s Jorge Ramos that “…what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I’m promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.”                
                

            
                Well, even though the President had a veto-proof Congress for the first two years of his term  -- more than 700 days with a majority of Democrats in the House and Senate who could have helped him pass immigration reform – he did nothing. Instead, he ignored the dire state of our economy and his promise to reform immigration, pushing through his health care law.                
                

            
                Why did he ignore his promise to our community? At best, we might conclude that he couldn’t get enough votes from his own party. After all, there are Democrats who don’t support immigration reform because unions oppose a guest worker program. At worst, Obama wasn’t committed to getting it done, figuring he could blame the Republicans and demonize them with Hispanics.                
                

            
                Now let’s compare President Obama’s lackadaisical approach to immigration reform with his push for a health care law. He cared so much about health care reform that he helped craft legislation, campaigned for its passage, and negotiated with elected officials to garner their support. Now that is commitment.                
                

            
                Confronted with his broken promise and an impending election, the President decided, just five months before the 2012 presidential elections, to issue an executive order allowing for a temporary, pseudo-DREAM Act. I agree that this unilateral measure is indeed beneficial to the children of undocumented immigrants brought here through no fault of their own. However, if President Obama cared so much about this issue, why didn’t he pass a permanent measure over two years ago when he knew he had the chance? It looks political, it smells political…could it be political?                
                

            
                To top it all off, President Obama has deported more immigrants than any other president in history - 400,000 each year - over 1.4 million people - separating countless families during his presidency.                
                

            
                Now, the president is asking us for four more years with the same promise of post-election immigration reform. In a recent article, the headline reads, “Obama says Latino vote is key to victory, vows immigration reform in 2013.” This deal sounds awfully familiar. Hispanics need to take a closer look at what the president has and has not delivered, and not just what he says.

Will Paul Ryan's Medicare Plan Bring Back Pelosi?,"Well that was quick.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                A month ago all politics in Washington was about the budget deficit and Republicans held the high ground in calling for more budget cuts.                
                

            
                Today all politics in Washington is now focused on Medicare and Democrats hold the high ground in protecting a program seniors don’t want to lose.                
                

            
                Here are 5 ways the political winds have shifted in a flash:                
                

            
                1. This week the Senate rejected a House plan calling for major changes in Medicare. Democrat Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said the Republican reform of the government program amounted to ending Medicare “as we know it.”                
                

            
                Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid chimed in, too, saying that the GOP’s Medicare plan amounts to one that “makes the rich richer and the sick sicker.”                
                

            
                2. And then there was the upset in the special election for New York’s 26th Congressional District. After the Democratic candidate triumphed in the traditional GOP stronghold the Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee weighed in. Democrats and Republicans, he said, had learned three lessons from the special election, “Medicare, Medicare, Medicare.”                
                

            
                But he didn’t stop there. He boldly predicted that Democrats now had a chance to regain the approximately 25 seats they’ll need to take control of the House next year. ""I fundamentally believe the House of Representatives is in play,"" he said.                
                

            
                3. The country’s highest ranking Republican, House Speaker John Boehner, admitted publicly that the loss in a heavily GOP district in upstate New York was partly “had to do with Medicare.”                
                

            
                4. Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn walked out of budget negotiations because he wanted bigger cuts in Medicare spending. That means budget talks are stalled over Medicare. The issue now is that cuts to Medicare will define budget talks. That puts Democrats in the favorable , charmed role of starring as of champions for Medicare.                
                

            
                5. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign has imploded among fellow Republicans over his criticism of the Ryan plan as “radical” and social engineering.                
                

            
                Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty says the Ryan plan is okay but he will offer a different plan to the voters.
The Republican faithful on Capitol Hill are telling me that they simply have a “message problem” with Medicare. They say they want to do a better job reminding voters about long-standing concerns over big government deficit spending.
They want to point out that Democrats have no plan for dealing with financial problems that will one day bankrupt Medicare.                
                

            
                Republicans are fooling only themselves if they believe they can get away from the fact that 235 House Republicans voted to pass the Ryan plan in April. They are forgetting their success in using the Democrats’ vote for health care reform to rout them last fall. The voters that handed them that impressive victory are now the same voters who have now turned against them.                
                

            
                The hard fact is every poll shows the Ryan plan – which turns Medicare into a voucher program and forces senior citizens to negotiate with private insurance companies – is unpopular with people over 65 and their children.
In the 26th Congressional district of New York senior made up 15% of all voters. News reports and polls reveal that those voters, who have fears about cuts to Medicare, made the difference.                
                

            
                Jane Corwin, the Republican who lost the race, tried to reduce Republican support for the Ryan plan to a messaging problem. In the middle of her campaign, after she went on the record in support of the plan, she said this:                
                

            
                ""There have been a lot of lies and distortions about what my position on Medicare is, and it scares seniors quite frankly and I'm shocked and appalled by that,” a frustrated Corwin said. “And I think it's important seniors understand that I'm trying to save the program. I want to protect it for them and for future generations.""                
                

            
                It didn’t work. And it won’t work for Republicans nationwide. -- Even if they accuse Democrats of using ""Medi-Scare"" tactics.                
                

            
                The GOP had better come up with a effective explanation or defense of the Ryan plan before 2012 or the gains they made in 2010 will be erased. Otherwise, it might not be ridiculous to speculate about whether Nancy Pelosi will end up back in the Speaker’s chair.

Bad News for Barack on Tuesday?,"There will be no coat tails on Tuesday for President Obama. In spite of the â€œbarnstormingâ€� the president and vice president have done in New York Congressional District 23 for candidate Bill Owens, in New Jersey for Governor Jon Corzine or in Virginia for candidate Creigh Deeds, Democrats will not score big victories or perhaps any victories at all.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Letâ€™s look at snapshots of Tuesday's three major races:                
                

            
                Virginia: For the past few weeks Attorney General Bob McDonnell has has a double digit lead over State Senator Creigh Deeds. In 2008 Virginia went for Obama currently a Democrat occupies the governor's mansion. The issue on voters' minds is the economy -- first and foremost -- and that will also be a wake up call for the Obama administration. They should be focused on the economy and not on the manufactured ""crisis"" of health care reform.                
                

            
                New Jersey: The fact that New Jersey -- a royal blue state for Democrats -- is as close as it is in tomorrowâ€™s governors race should be very troubling for Democrats. As of this morning, the Republican challenger, U.S. Attorney Chris Christie leads the incumbent Democratic Governor Jon Corzine by 1.5%. Even if the Republican candidate cannot squeak out a win,  the fact that the race is this close, should send shivers up the spine of Democrats now and as they look ahead to 2010. The issue in New Jersey is jobs and the highest real estate taxes in the country.                
                

            
                New York: The New York Special Election to fill the vacant seat of Congressman McHugh is a mess. The District 23 seat in upstate New York has been a safe Republican seat for over a 100 years. We would not even be talking about this race had Congressman McHugh not resigned to join the Obama administration as Secretary of the Army. That is water over the dam.                 
                

            
                The Republicans in District 23 selected Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava to be their candidate to fill the vacancy; she had the support of local, state and national Republican Committees. Then along comes conservative multi-millionaire accountant Doug Hoffman -- who wanted to be a spoiler -- he challenged the socially moderate/liberal positions of the Republican nominee.                 
                

            
                Mr. Hoffman got the attention of nationally recognized Republicans like former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson. All three of these nationally recognized politicians agreed to personally appear with Hoffman and also appear in campaign ads. As a result Hoffman started to make headway in the polls. High profile Republicans, turning on one of their own coupled with the unlimited financial resources of the rich spoiler, spelled the end for the Republican candidate dropped out of the race this past weekend.                 
                

            
                But hold on, because the story gets better. Not only did the Republican Scozzafava drop out but she endorsed the Democrat in the race: Bill Owens.                 
                

            
                Republicans need to get their act together if they are going to be able to exploit the opportunities that are available in 2010 to take back seats in the House and the Senate. Turning on one of their own -- after the primaries and selection processes for candidates has run its course -- will spell disaster for Republicans. For major national party leaders to come into states to campaign against Republicans should be unacceptable. I do not agree with some Republican candidates and office holders but will support them for the good of the party. You cannot sustain a party organization with a â€œevery man for himselfâ€� strategy.                
                

            
                Today, I wrapped up some 10 regional radio interviews for FOX radio affiliates all across the country. The number one issue on the minds of Americans is the economy. It is all about jobs, taxes, the growth of government, spending and the deficit. People are scared and there is a â€œthrow the bums outâ€� mentality that is reminiscent of 1994.

Supreme Court upholds ObamaCare and Americans have lost the right to be left alone,"Editor's note: The National Federation of Independent Business joined with 26 states in the lawsuit against the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The author of this commentary, Karen Harned is the executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Legal Center.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                When President Obama signed the Patients Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly known as ""ObamaCare"" into law in 2010, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) decided that we had to take the fight to the Courts.                  
                

            
                We joined the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the health care law because, for months, we had heard from small business owners who were greatly concerned over the costs, the burdens and the impositions that the PPACA would bring. They believed it threatened their businesses, employees, families, and livelihoods.                 
                

            
                So we fought to the bitter end to keep their fears from playing out.                  
                

            
                Yet this case was about something bigger than health care policy, it was about preserving American liberty from the increasingly powerful hand of the federal government.                  
                

            
                Today marks a sad day in the history of America. With this decision, Americans have lost the right to be left alone, which Justice William O. Douglas once called “the beginning of all freedom.”                 
                

            
                It is painful to recognize that the liberties which our forefathers fought a revolution to secure have been lost. But it is clear that our original constitutional system has been thrown out, and we are left with only the democratic process to preserve our rights. That should be a sobering thought for anyone who values liberty.                
                

            
                The significance of this decision cannot be overstated. Our Founding Fathers were greatly concerned that by giving too much power to the federal government, they would be endangering our liberties. So they sought to restrain the federal government by vesting it with only limited powers. As James Madison said, the powers of the federal government were to be “few and defined.” Yet with this decision, it is clear that the powers of the federal government are no longer limited at all. Our only remaining protections are with those liberties which were explicitly spelled out in the Bill of Rights, and even those are under assault. So today Madison’s vision of the American Republic has been turned on its head: The powers of the federal government are now broad and uncabined, and the freedoms of the people are few and confined.                
                

            
                As Justice Kennedy put it, during oral arguments in March, the individual mandate “changes the relationship of the Federal Government to the individual in a very fundamental way.” We wholeheartedly wish that more weight had been added to that statement in the Court’s opinion. But the die has been cast.                 
                

            
                We must now look forward, with great trepidation, into this brave new world, a world in which the Constitution has been undone, and federal power knows no limit. This is a day that our Founders would never have wanted to see. All that they had fought to secure and preserve has been lost.                
                

            
                But, it is important to realize that at the end of the day this is about real people. We were fighting so that small business owners would not be subject to paternalistic demands to buy a product that they did not want, or need.                 
                

            
                We were fighting so that you and I could choose whether or not to buy broccoli, or cars or gym memberships or solar panels. With this decision, we no longer have the choice.                
                

            
                What will happen next is anyone’s guess. But it seems clear that the political dialogue over health care reforms will continue.                 
                

            
                In any event, we will never give up, and we will never give in. Today we have suffered a terrible setback, but we will press on in our fight to protect small business owners, and to restore our lost Constitution.                
                

            
                On the health care front, the mandates and burdens imposed by the PPACA remain a grave concern for small businesses. Moreover, small business owners are still worried about the costs of health care; so health care reform will remain a top priority for NFIB.                 
                

            
                We have long advocated free-market oriented health care solutions that will benefit all Americans without putting undue strain on our job creators, and we will continue to carry that banner forward until we have achieved workable solutions to these vexing problems.

                As President Obama arrives at the one-year anniversary of his inauguration on Wednesday, his job approval rating has plummeted from the thrill of 68% after his first week in office to the agony of 46%, the lowest level yet recorded in a recent CBS News poll. In tomorrow’s special election for Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat in Massachusetts, according to Public Policy Polling, Democratic candidate Martha Coakley “is actually more popular than Obama—she has a 50% favorable rating while he has a 44% approval rating.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This fall from grace reflects a squaring with reality that has hit the public, but not Obama. He continues to have the audacity to compare himself flatteringly to past presidents, by invoking their words or deeds.                
                

            
                On January 7, speaking of the intelligence and security breakdowns related to the “underwear bomber,” Obama used a slight variation on a phrase made famous by former President Harry Truman. Obama said, “Ultimately the buck stops with me. When the system fails, it’s my responsibility.” Truman had a sign on his desk, “The Buck Stops Here!”                
                

            
                Obama also used Truman’s pledge, “The buck stops with me,” on March 18, 2009 when discussing the outrage over executives from AIG reaping $165-million in bonus pay after a $180-billion taxpayer bailout of the insurer. ""Ultimately I'm responsible,” Obama continued. “I'm the president of the United States. And my goal is to make sure that we never put ourselves in this kind of position again.""                
                

            
                But a year into his presidency, how has the buck stopped with Obama? There’s a total disconnect between what he says and what he does. Israel could teach us to emulate their error-free airport security but Obama’s Mideast envoy is too busy threatening Israel with sanctions. Our president lashes out at bonuses paid to bailed-out company executives, while he hits them up for political contributions. And whatever happened to his first-day-on-the-job promise that, “Transparency and rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency”? How is that consistent with health care reform secretly negotiated by Democrats? (Forget about Obama’s campaign guarantee to show the process on C-Span.) “ObamaCare” is infected with sweetheart deals, ranging from vote buying to giveaways to unions. And how about Obama’s treasury secretary, who was head of the New York Fed when it ordered AIG to hide details of its billions in overpayments to Wall Street firms?                
                

            
                The CBS poll found public fear of another terrorist attack in the next few months is at its highest level in seven years and that the public gives Obama their lowest approval so far on his handling of the economy (41%) and health care reform (36%).                
                

            
                It is hubris for Obama to link himself to the accountability of Harry Truman. Historians declare that Truman was one of the greatest U.S. presidents as a defender of national security. Truman led the country from World War II to a peacetime economy that avoided a recession. It is incredibly nervy for Obama to suggest that he measures up to Truman’s candor and willingness to accept responsibility for himself and his administration.                
                

            
                Yet associating himself with past presidents by recalling their language and accomplishments is nothing new for our president.                
                

            
                Only four months after his inauguration, Obama declared at a Hollywood fundraiser, ""I would put these first four months up against any prior administration since FDR. We didn't ask for the challenges that we face, but we don't shrink from them either.""                
                

            
                Actually he expanded them, to the bursting point. By May 2009, Obama had rammed through his $787-billion “economic stimulus” that doubled the nation’s debt and failed to stem the loss of 4.2-million jobs by year-end (the most since 1940). His bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and foreclosed homeowners were underway and have since become financial fiascoes. He in fact nationalized General Motors, Chrysler and AIG and turned his focus to nationalized health care.
In those first four months, his Homeland Security Secretary redefined terrorism as “man-made disasters.” His Secretary of State told reporters that the Obama Administration has stopped using the phrase “war on terror.” He insisted that the Guantanamo Bay prison housing terrorists be closed “as soon as possible.” He declared war—on the CIA by releasing Justice Department memorandums from 2002 and 2005 describing interrogation techniques, authorized for use by the CIA against detainees in secret detention facilities, which he ordered closed.

Four months into his term, Obama also embarked on a worldwide “apology tour,” saying America had been, as he put it, arrogant, “dismissive and even divisive.” He bowed to the King of Saudi Arabia and greeted Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez with a broad smile and a “soul brother” handshake.                
                

            
                As we approach the anniversary of the president's inauguration, if he is going to properly compare himself to any other U.S. president in words and deeds, he should pick Jimmy Carter, whose infamous “malaise” speech described a “crisis of confidence,” and “a fundamental threat to American democracy” which ominously sounds like America today.                
                

            
                Carter said, “The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America. We've always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own.                
                

            
                “Our people are losing that faith, not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy. The symptoms of this crisis of the American spirit are all around us. For the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years.                
                

            
                “The gap between our citizens and our government has never been so wide.”                
                

            
                Another president that Obama likes to compare himself to is Abraham Lincoln. But the quote attributed to Lincoln that best applies to Obama a year into his presidency is: “You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.”

"Health care bill passes in House, Trump and GOP finally come together","GOP members of the House finally climbed aboard the Trump Train. 
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                It’s about time. 
                
                


                
            
                Putting aside their posturing and pontificating, Republicans at long last produced a win for the Trump White House and for Americans, passing a bill to replace ObamaCare. This was a central promise of the past several years; they needed to get it done.
                
                


                
            
                It wasn’t easy, but as Joe Biden might say, “This is a big f—ing deal!”
                
                


                
            
                The earlier failure to pass the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was a serious setback for the Trump White House, portraying the president and his aides as ill prepared to manage the affairs of the nation. 
                
                


                
            
                Voters were incredulous that after seven years of railing about the deficiencies of ObamaCare, Republicans didn’t have a shared vision for what should replace it. 
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                The inability to muster votes on the first bill exposed long-simmering disputes within the Republican party – disputes barely muted by Trump’s astonishing victory in November.
                
                


                
            
                Thursday’s successful vote is a major victory for President Trump. House members have credited the president for sticking with the fight, and the punditry is astonished that the AHCA, declared dead just a few weeks ago, actually passed. 
                
                


                
            
                Trump wheedled and cajoled, invited objectors from across the political spectrum in for an Oval Office chat, encouraged compromises and won over recalcitrant members of his own party. This is what we expect from Trump; this is the Art of the Deal.
                
                


                
            
                It is also a needed much-needed victory for the House leadership. Trump supporters are impatient with the lack of legislative progress since the election, perhaps unrealistic in their expectations. The spending bill passed this week by Congress, which failed to reflect numerous conservative priorities, enraged many on the right. Repealing ObamaCare will mollify some of those critics.
                
                


                
            
                Not only is the vote a win for health care reform; it is also a win for tax reform. The repeal of the taxes that supported the Affordable Care Act will save Americans one trillion dollars over the coming decade. That savings makes further tax cuts much easier to pass, since the reduced rates will be applied to a lower tax base. As the GOP struggles to produce a tax bill resulting in revenue neutrality, that trillion will loom large.
                
                


                
            
                Thursday’s narrow victory is of course not the end of the story. The Senate will now get a whack at the bill that will replace ObamaCare; that expected row will usher in more hand-wringing from the left. 
                
                


                
            
                Democrats cleverly put the GOP on the defensive early on in this fight, portraying President Obama’s legacy plan as the Holy Grail of health care solutions. Even as it continues to fail across the country.
                
                


                
            
                Much has been written of the shortcomings of ObamaCare, focusing in particular on the soaring premiums and rising deductibles that will only worsen this year. The truth is that a sizeable share of the population can afford health care insurance under the current plan, but not health care.
                
                


                
            
                The central failure of ObamaCare is that it does not allow insurers to charge more for customers that will require higher expenditures. Women, for instance, who require higher medical expenditures, pay the same as men under ObamaCare. Also, people with so-called “pre-existing conditions” pay the same as all others. Simply put, this is not insurance, it is welfare.
                
                


                
            
                Providing affordable insurance to all Americans – even those who are sick -- is now expected. The question is how to do that while keeping private insurers in the game. That is the intent of the modifications made to Paul Ryan’s bill, including an extra $8 billion provided to cover high-risk pools for those people with pre-existing conditions.
                
                


                
            
                The vote comes before the Congressional Budget Office has had a chance to score it. Democrats will jump on the eventual CBO report, which will most likely project that some people will lose coverage. The GOP bill will be portrayed by Democrats as heartless and mean-spirited. 
                
                


                
            
                What will not be reported by the New York Times or CNN is how many Americans have stopped going to the doctor because their ObamaCare deductible is just too high. 
                
                


                
            
                Or how many parts of the country no longer have an insurance exchange available.
                
                


                
            
                 Just in the last few weeks several companies have pulled out of Iowa, citing losses, threatening to leave that state with no individual plans. Virginia, too, is bleeding plans, as are many other states. 
                
                


                
            
                ObamaCare is simply not working; it is indefensible.
                
                


                
            
                This fight is not over. Democrats do not want to see President Obama’s principle achievement ditched. The GOP has to manage the conversation, and explain how the new bill will help middle-class Americans. They should be ready to go with ads that feature working Americans unable to pay their doctor bills, even as they are covered by ObamaCare, or Obamasnare, as it might be portrayed for millions trapped in their costly plans.
                
                


                
            
                Nancy Pelosi has accused Republicans of wanting to destroy health care and take protections away from millions., all the while providing massive tax breaks for plutocrats. 
                
                


                
            
                Republicans must drown out such extreme voices, remind Americans that ObamaCare is failing, and move forward with the Trump agenda. 
                
                


                
            
                That’s what they were elected to do.

Obama = Failure,"AP
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                America is at war, militarily and politically. The current situation we finds ourselves in with our commander-in-chief reminds me of a May 2007 article called “A Failure In Generalship,” in which author, Lt. Col. Paul Yingling, writes “Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz noted that passion, probability and policy each play their role in war.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Let me repeat. Our nation is at war, militarily and politically—and that’s where passion, probability and policy are so important for the president. As commander-in-chief President Obama is our top general and he also serves as the political “general” of the Democratic Party. By Yingling’s standards, Obama’s attempts at leadership so far are a study in failure: a failure in generalship.                
                

            
                Yingling, who served two tours in Iraq, another in Bosnia and a fourth in Operation Desert Storm, writes, “The greatest error the statesman can make is to commit his nation to a great conflict without mobilizing popular passions to a level commensurate with the stakes of the conflict.”                
                

            
                More than a year into his presidency, Obama has made that error on a number of “great conflicts” involving national and economic security. The toll it is taking is reflected in a new CNN poll in which 52 percent of Americans say the president doesn’t deserve reelection in 2012.
Near the end of January, a Rasmussen poll reported that only “thirty-eight percent of voters say the United States and its allies are winning the war on terror. Numbers that bleak haven’t been recorded in consecutive surveys since the middle of 2007.” A new military offensive in Afghanistan could improve that assessment, but what is especially galling the public is how the Obama administration is treating captured terrorists. In a Quinnipiac University poll, “American voters say 59-35 percent that 9/11 terrorism suspects should be tried in military courts rather than in civilian courts.” After the arrest of the “Christmas Day bomber”—who was read his Miranda rights, assigned a lawyer, and then stopped talking—fifty-eight percent of American voters in a Rasmussen poll said waterboarding and other torture techniques should be used on the suspect to get information: another rebuke to what Obama supports.                
                

            
                A recent Gallup poll found that, “sixty percent of Americans say President Barack Obama has not spent enough time on economic problems.” But putting that in perspective, a Rasmussen poll a few weeks ago determined that “fifty-eight percent of voters also believed the government has too much influence over the economy.” A scant nine percent believed that Obama’s proposed three-year freeze on discretionary government spending “would reduce the deficit a lot.” And fifty-eight percent “opposed the president’s health care reform bill in Congress.”                
                

            
                Yingling continues, “To prevail, generals must provide policymakers and the public with a correct estimation of strategic probabilities. The general is responsible for estimating the likelihood of success in applying force to achieve the aims of policy. The general describes both the means necessary for the successful prosecution of war and the ways in which the nation will employ those means.”                
                

            
                Once again, so far Obama is a study in failure: a failure in generalship. A recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll stated that, “only 35 percent [of Americans] say they’re confident the president has the right set of goals and policies, and 54 percent believe he has accomplished ‘very little’ or ‘only some’ of his first-year office goals.” A Marist College survey of registered voters has Obama at forty-four percent job approval, the lowest of his presidency.                
                

            
                Yingling writes that, “However much it is influenced by passion and probability, war is ultimately an instrument of policy and its conduct is the responsibility of policymakers.”                
                

            
                This is Obama’s challenge today. He is aggressively selling his supposedly new policy prescriptions to win the wars for economic recovery and against terrorism. But most of them resemble policies he came into office peddling, and the American people are not buying them.

Obama has three years left in his term and the political and military wars he is fighting will change considerably in their outcomes and scope. Will he discover new ways to build alliances, outflank enemies and achieve victories?                
                

            
                One day it’s down for Obama when moderate Democratic Senator Evan Bayh says he won’t run for reelection, and the next day it’s up for Obama when the Taliban’s top military commander is reported captured in Pakistan.                
                

            
                Whether the president can improve on his current record of failure will depend on three variables that we should closely watch: passion, probability and policy.

"Be the Change, Mr. President","Make no mistake, I am still in the Obama court as one of the president's supporters but he needs to “be the change” like the campaign posters said in 2008. He needs to jump out of the Washington D.C. box and do something vastly different. Here is some quick advice from the liberal peanut gallery.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                1. Don’t pay too much attention to the Washington political establishment. Conventional wisdom says a president should not get too over exposed or risk looking non-presidential. Well, the time has come for unconventional wisdom. You should get on Twitter, Mr. President and let people know, a few times a day, what you are thinking.                
                

            
                2. Talk to the people who brought you to the dance. Get on the radio and many local television stations. President Bush met with talk show hosts in off the record sessions in the Oval Office, but he considered talk radio beneath him. Start talking and don’t worry about what kind of media is beneath the Presidency. Talk and be heard.                
                

            
                3. Give Fireside Chats a la President Roosevelt. Explain health care. Don’t do it in one speech or in a press conference, do it every couple of weeks. Do it on You Tube. Just do it.                
                

            
                4. Take on the budget and be willing to alienate the political establishment. Be willing to lose the next election by saying what's unpopular but true. Say the emperor has no clothes when it comes to our long-term deficit. Be the Ross Perot of the political establishment and say that the third rail of American politics -- Social Security and Medicare -- are going to put us at 300% of GDP by 2050, which means the Chinese will come and repossess our homes and our car.                
                

            
                5. Stop thinking that this is the 2008 campaign. Bring everyone in to meetings and forget who supported Hillary Clinton. Make sure the staff opens their doors to everyone. Be inclusive of ideas and people.                
                

            
                6. Make a list of all the things that the left and right don’t want to hear but in your experience as president you know are true. Then write a book, shout it from the Oval office and tell America the truth.                
                

            
                I do not believe that the Massachusetts special Senate election was a referendum on the Obama presidency but it is already being perceived that way. Perception is everything and in the start of his second year the president can change the perception. Be the Change, Mr. President.

5 Thoughts On the Baucus Bill,"The Senate Finance Committee is poised to vote today on Chairman Max Baucus' health care plan.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                If one had to bet, one would bet that the Democrats are likely, in the end, to ""get something."" Public option? Probably not. Universal coverage? Definitely not. ""Bending the curve"" on costs? Definitely not. But that's OK, because ""muddling through"" is always a good option in a democratic society. The joke floating around Washington is that if a piece of paper bearing only the words, ""Health Care Reform Act of 2009"" floated onto Barack Obama's desk, he would happily sign it and take credit for it: mission accomplished.                
                

            
                But the question is, why has it been so hard for the Democrats? After all, there's a Democratic president who campaigned on health care reform and who won in the biggest landslide for a Democrat in more than four decades. And, not only that, the Democrats have huge majorities in both houses of Congress.                
                

            
                So why the difficulty? I can think of five reasons, which are full of implications for this bill as it struggles to come to life in the years ahead.                
                

            
                #1. Obama Has Already Shot His Fiscal Wad                
                

            
                The first reason is the simplest: Obama shot his fiscal wad on Wall Street bailouts, auto takeovers, and stimulus packages. As Obama said when speaking about the nation's fiscal situation on May 22, ""Well, we are out of money now.""                 
                

            
                And as I wrote in June for U.S. News & World Report:                 
                

            
                When confronted with a choice between health care for the poor and the near-poor on the one hand, and the continued overstuffing of the overclass on the other hand, Obama made a decisive choice: He chose the overclass. He put rich people first.                
                

            
                It's a first-class-first process ably described by the economist Mancur Olson, and any number of economists way to Olson's left--the rich belly up to the food table ahead of everyone else, eat everything they can till they are done, and then the middle class and the poor are left to fight over the crumbs.                
                

            
                #2. Obamacare Is Actually Welfare In Disguise                
                

            
                The second reason for the difficulty is the public perception that the current plan is a welfare plan in disguise. The common jibe among Republicans is that Obamacare will degrade coverage for 250 million or so Americans so that it can function as a voter-registration plan for 30 or 40 million Americans. Benjamin Barber-type “Strong Democracy” is popular enough -- if you are inspiring the broad middle to take greater control of their own lives in an Andrew Jacksonian sense -- but if the thrust of contemporary liberalism proves to be just a veil ill-concealing yet another welfare program, well, the middle class is unlikely to like it. As the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan long lamented, in recent decades, the national Democrats have seemed mostly incapable of thinking of a plan for helping the middle working class, as opposed to the poor or some other avant-garde group. (Or the rich, see reason #1 above.)                
                

            
                #3. Big Doubts About the Government's Ability to Run Health Care                
                

            
                The third reason is the manifest failure of government to prove its competence. A century ago, Max Weber could write, with a straight face, that the reason for the rise of bureaucracy was its ""technical superiority."" Times have changed. Today's federal government is not exactly bureaucratic, of course. Policymaking has been substantially outsourced to judges, lawyers, and outside activists--and contractors seem to be doing a lot of the in-house work. But by any name, or in any form, the business of the federal government does not smell sweet to most Americans.                 
                

            
                When today's liberals say that ""health care management"" is the answer, with them, of course, doing the managing, some Americans think ""death panels,"" and plenty more are skeptical that any kind of government management can work.                
                

            
                #4. Welfare-state Liberalism vs. Multiculturalism                
                

            
                The fourth reason is the breakdown in the mutuality that is needed for a welfarist, communitarian ethos to flourish in a nation. That breakdown was incapsulated in ""The Heckle Heard 'Round The World,"" that is, Rep. Joe Wilson's ""You Lie!"" catcall against President Obama when Obama said, in his September 9 speech to Congress, ""There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants. This, too, is false — the reforms I’m proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally."" Whereupon Wilson erupted.                
                

            
                Let's step back from the theatrics of that incident and think about the basics of the plot: A white Southerner rudely calls out an African-American for saying that illegals -- most of whom are Hispanic--would not be covered. Whereupon Wilson apologizes, but more profoundly, the Senate Finance Committee takes extra measures to make sure illegals aren't covered, thereupon lending credence to Wilson's shouted charge.                
                

            
                The point here is not to defend Wilson or his manners. Instead, the point is that the Democrats, trying to manage their rainbow coalition, feel electorally vulnerable on the question of whether or not their health care plan will cover illegals -- and with good reason. Everyone knows that they want to cover illegals, as a matter of social justice, and everyone who thinks about public health realizes that some provision needs to be made so that nobody is walking around coughing up tuberculosis on the streets. Like any other contagious disease, TB is completely agnostic about legal vs. illegal.                
                

            
                The broader issue crunching down on the Democrats is welfare-state liberalism vs. multiculturalism. As Harvard's Robert Putnam has noted, along with many others, the communitarian ethos that upholds the welfare state is based substantially on ethnic trust and national commonality, and those bonds of affection and unity have a way of breaking down amidst multiculturalism. Welfare states thrive in homogenous countries, they are smaller and less expansive in heterogenous countries- - and as for really heterogenous countries, well, they have a way of becoming ex-countries, viz. the USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and so on.                
                

            
                #5. Americans Want CURES Not ""Reforms""                
                

            
                The fifth reason for the Democrat's difficulty is the basic flaw in the intellectual model: ""health insurance reform"" is not the goal of most Americans. What the American people really want is cures. You don't go to the doctor because you can, because the government has given you some card entitling you to low-tech care. Nor do you go to the doctor to show off the intellectual ingenuity of your health care savings account. Instead, you go to the doctor to get better. Ask yourself: Where in the Obama pitch is there any discussion of actually curing anything? (One doesn't hear much ""cure talk"" among Republicans, either, but they, being the minority, aren't the issue right now. In the next Congress, or the one after that, they might regain the majority; we can revisit them then.)                
                

            
                The story of 2009 is the apotheosis of the left-liberal idea--inflected by ""Club of Rome""-ish environmentalism and residual enthusiasm for barefoot doctors--that we have enough health, or maybe even too much health. So don't worry about the creation of health; in fact, the creation of new medicines needs to be restrained, in the name of ""cost control. The main imperative is the redistribution of health, not the creation of health.                
                

            
                At Serious Medicine Strategy we think that redistributionist ethos is bad politics and even worse for medicine, but the Democrats now have their moment.

"It’s time to lead, GOP","Now Playing                            McConnell: Tonight we begin race to turn this country around                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Last September, Nancy Pelosi warned Americans that a Republican Senate majority would mean that ""civilization as we know it would be in jeopardy."" We can only hope the Congresswoman is putting the finishing touches on her doomsday bunker, because it’s official -- the Republican Party holds the keys to the Senate for the first time since 2007.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The question now becomes, what are they going to do with them? A dual majority gives the Republican Party a tremendous opportunity to lead, but also a responsibility to regain America’s faith in the legislative process by passing good policy and functioning properly.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                But despite the long road of work that lies ahead, there are some things worth celebrating immediately:                 
                

            
                -  Harry Reid can no longer block fiscally responsible policy reforms from reaching the Senate floor.                 
                

            
                - Barack Obama can no longer legislate from the White House while the Senate sits idly by, rubber stamping his unilateral political agenda.                
                

            
                But after the confetti settles, it’s time for the GOP to get to work. Unfortunately, their hand-picked candidates failed to articulate their policy priorities from the campaign trail, and instead relied on a campaign platform that can be best summed up as “I’m not Barack Obama.”                 
                

            
                But “I’m not Barack Obama” is most certainly not the compelling legislative agenda that Republicans so desperately need.  And it’s no secret at this point that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are not the leaders who will lead Republicans towards a positive pro-reform platform with real policy solutions.                  
                

            
                The real policy solutions are going to come from the “Ideas Wing” of the GOP in the next House and Senate, the new generation of principled and energetic leadership that came in with the classes of ’10, ’12 and ’14.                
                

            
                Watch for newly-elected Ben Sasse to spearhead health care reform legislation that puts patients first and lowers costs. Senator Mike Lee will become a guiding think-tank for the GOP from his new leadership position on the Senate Steering Committee. Members of the Liberty Caucus like Justin Amash and Thomas Massie will continue to drive issues like Internet freedom and civil liberties in the House.                
                

            
                Republican leadership has the opportunity to put failed programs on the table for elimination, return to regular order, put these ideas on the president’s desk and force him to explain why he opposes good policy.                
                

            
                If a Republican-led House and Senate can work together to send real reforms to the White House, they will set the stage for a successful 2016 presidential battle. The American people will finally have a good idea of what the GOP stands for, and see who has really been creating gridlock in Washington when Obama sends them back.                
                

            
                Simply opposing the president without alternative policy solutions is not going to cut it anymore. If the GOP can unite around an inclusive liberty agenda in 2016 and engage -- rather than alienate -- their grassroots base, they’ll win big just like they should have in 2012.                
                

            
                I believe in the new generation of leadership in the GOP, and the growing coalition of small-l libertarians who will join them in the next Congress. Enjoy the victory, finish your drinks, but on Wednesday morning, it’s time to lead.

Demonizing the Insurance Industry Is Not the Answer,"In a last ditch effort to cram their health care reform package through Congress, Democrats have ramped up their demonization of private health insurers. They blame an alleged lack of competition in health insurance for all sorts of ills – from higher premiums to insurers denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions or dropping people who get sick.

According to the White House blog last week: ""the insurers’ monopoly is so strong that they can continue to jack up rates as much as they like."" In The New York Times on Friday, Paul Krugman attacks what he calls the ""vileness"" of profit driven insurance companies. These arguments are echoed in Congress. In an ostensible effort to promote competition, the House recently passed legislation to exclude health insurance from the partial anti-trust exemption for the “business of insurance.” The 39 percent premium increase by Anthem Blue Cross for its individual (non-group) policyholders in California is continually touted as evidence of this monopoly power.

But what are the facts of this alleged monopoly power? Despite claims that it produces huge profits, health insurers’ profits generally average 3-5 percent of premiums. During the first nine months of 2009, profit margins were just 2.4 percent.

In his health care address to Congress last fall, Mr. Obama claimed:                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                ""Unfortunately, in 34 states, 75% of the insurance market is controlled by five or fewer companies. In Alabama, just one company controls almost 90% of the market. Without competition, the price of insurance goes up and the quality goes down."" Likewise, on February 23, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs cited an American Medical Association study showing: “that 94 percent of the U.S. health insurance markets were highly concentrated.""

Yet, both the president's and AMA’s numbers are misleading as they look at less than half of the insurance market. About 55 percent of those insured receive their insurance from a “self-insured” employer, where the employer acts as the insurer, rather than from a traditional insurance company. These ""self-insured"" employers often hire other firms, including insurance companies, to help administer the plans (they handle the paperwork and form networks with doctors and hospitals). While employees often naturally think that the insurance company named on their insurance cards is providing the coverage, employers determine the details of coverage – from benefits to what premium the employee contributes – and they are responsible for putting aside money to cover employee medical costs.

The self-insured market consists of thousands of employers acting as insurance providers and competing for workers based on the salary they pay and the benefits they offer. Over 900 companies handle the administration of self-insured plans, with fees typically running three to eight percent of the total cost of insurance, depending on the employer’s size.

To see the difference this makes, take the president's worst-case example of Alabama. The largest insurance company, Blue Cross/ Blue Shield of Alabama, accounts for 83 percent of the “fully insured” market, as opposed to self-insured employer plans. The fully insured market is therefore highly concentrated. But 57 percent of those insured in Alabama get their coverage through thousands of employer self-funded plans. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Alabama thus has only 36 percent of the total insurance market. The next largest insurance company in the state, Health Choice, has just 5 percent of the fully insured market, or 2.2 percent of the entire market.

Thus, it would be hard for Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Alabama to engage in price gouging, even if it wanted to, as many customers could turn to other insurers or more often, self-insure. In addition, the company is a non-profit entity, and its “profits” typically equal about 1 percent of its premiums.                
                

            
                Or take the president’s claim that in the 34 most concentrated states, five or fewer companies control 75 percent of the insurance market. Given that self-insured firms cover over half of the people insured in those states, the total market share for the largest five insurers would average closer to 30 percent than 75 percent.

Allowing competition across state borders would be helpful, but the benefit has nothing to do with monopoly power -- it would allow more efficient insurance companies to expand. Many companies self-insure precisely to avoid state regulations that raise costs. Self-insurance is not regulated by the states but only comes under what has been, up to now, less restrictive federal rules.

As for the current anti-trust exemption for insurance companies, it likely promotes pro-competitive activity. Small insurers and employers use data on medical claims collected from many employers and health insurers to project the cost of providing health benefits. Small operations particularly benefit from sharing date because they do not have enough policyholders or employees to accurately forecast costs. While it is uncertain whether the existing anti-trust exemption is necessary to permit these activities, repealing it might lead to some data sharing activities being challenged, raising costs and leading small operations to stop providing coverage.                
                

            
                So, if insurance monopolies aren’t responsible for the higher premiums, what is? Regulation is a significant part of the problem. Take the 39 percent increase in insurance premiums from California’s Anthem Blue Cross. That state’s regulations make some people who buy insurance heavily subsidize others in the individual insurance market. Young people pay more than what it costs to insure them and older people pay less. The same discrimination occurs broadly between healthy and not so healthy people. What this government-imposed pricing has meant is that many healthier people decided to stop buying health insurance, leaving fewer people to subsidize the high cost, riskier policies and raising everyone's rates.                
                

            
                A survey conducted jointly by the Kaiser Family Foundation, ABC News and USA Today, released in October 2006, found that 93 percent of insured Americans who had recently suffered a serious illness were satisfied with their health care. The survey questions in this poll were also asked of uninsured Americans, and Harris/Decima TeleVox asked them of Canadians covered by their government system. Uninsured Americans, not surprisingly, were not as satisfied as people who have insurance. Nonetheless, 70 percent of the uninsured who indicated their level of satisfaction said they were either ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied"" with their health care, and only 17.5 percent said they were ""very dissatisfied."" Canadians are much less happy with their health care compared to insured Americans and just slightly more satisfied than uninsured Americans.                
                

            
                Few industries have as many competitors as health insurance. Despite President Obama’s distorted data, monopoly power isn’t the problem. Government mandates are the problem. Health insurance will only become more expensive if Obamacare becomes law.

KARL ROVE: Saying 'I Told Him So' On the Way Out the Door In Obama's Washington,"Two small episodes Saturday night and Monday morning were deeply revealing about the culture of official Washington now.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Keith Koffler wrote about the first Sunday for “White House Dossier.” Atlantic Media — publisher of The Atlantic, National Journal, and Government Executive and which describes itself as “among the most influential media outlets in America” — hosted a going-away party for presidential senior adviser David Axelrod. It was held at the home of his former White House colleague, Linda Douglass, a reporter for ABC News before joining the administration.

The party drew President Barack Obama, Cabinet officials, White House aides and a passel of first-tier journalists, including (according to Koffler): Major Garrett of National Journal, John Harwood of the New York Times, Jake Tapper of ABC News and Chuck Todd of NBC News.

Could anyone imagine what would have been said about the inappropriateness of a similar event hosted by a news organization like Congressional Quarterly as a going-away party for a senior aide from a Republican White House?

But no, when it’s the Obama White House, it’s apparently just another cozy evening for the White House press corps and its subject.

Then there was story by Glenn Thrush in Politico based on an exit interview with Axelrod, colleagues and friends. In it, Axelrod (or his allies) say he “initially opposed Obama’s plan to push full-speed ahead with health care reform,” intimating it was a mistake to do so.                
                

            
                Axelrod also felt Obama rejected his advice to stay on the high road during the 2010 campaign, “fretting to friends that the midterms were putting too much ‘torque’ on Obama’s core image.”                 
                

            
                After being beaten at the polls, the president returned back to listening to Axelrod and is “increasingly turning back to [a] vision of an elevated politics as 2012 approaches.” If he keeps that tone, “Axelrod thinks Obama’s recent rebound is sustainable,” Politico went on.                
                

            
                Fortunately for President Obama who would otherwise have forgotten his campaign promises, Axelrod “ensured, at every step of the way in the White House, that the president stayed true to what he talked about” in 2008, though Politico reports,“ Axelrod’s political advice was often brushed aside in the name of legislative sausage-making, much to his frustration.”                
                

            
                For example, Politico reveals it was Axelrod who wanted to ban all earmarks at the administration’s start, “but was quickly overridden.” It took until this year’s State of the Union for the president to finally wake to the proper course of action and say he “would veto any spending bill that contained earmarks.”                
                

            
                Axelrod also “counseled Obama to crack down on bonuses given to executives at TARP-recipient banks” in early 2009. Not listening to his advisor resulted in “a political disaster” for the president that could have been avoided.                
                

            
                And so on.                
                

            
                Did Mr. Axelrod or the others who participated in the Politico story think they were doing President Obama any favors? It weakens the president to say that if only he had listened more to a departing adviser on issues and politics that he’d be in better shape. It’s self-serving and disloyal and apparently not unheard of. After all, similar stories also abound surrounding the departures of other aides like Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orzag and Chief of Staff Rahm Emmanuel, a standard practice for Team Obama.

Obama’s 'Indefensible' Health Care Plan,"Late in the evening on April 1, the Obama administration filed their official appeal with the 11th Circuit asking the court to overturn federal District Judge Roger Vinson’s pivotal decision declaring the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                They called the decision by federal Judge Roger Vinson “indefensible” and are obviously trying to convince the appeals court that Vinson’s decision is an anomaly that flies against established legal precedent. But are they overcompensating with somewhat dramatic accusations against a respected federal judge’s decision because they realize their arguments in defense of the health care law’s constitutionality are losing steam?                
                

            
                Whether the administration wants to admit it or not, when 26 states, and NFIB, the nation’s largest small business advocacy group, join forces in a lawsuit against a federal law, and a federal district judge rules in their favor, the lawsuit has merit and deserves to be taken seriously.                
                

            
                Constitutional experts from both political parties along with several other district court judges have reached different conclusions over whether or not the individual mandate, or minimum coverage provision, requiring citizens to purchase government approved health insurance, is constitutional. And no one can definitely say how the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately rule on this issue.                
                

            
                What we know for sure, is that by passing the individual mandate, and compelling citizens to purchase a private product, Congress crossed a line that has not been crossed before. For the first time, the federal government is trying to manipulate their power to regulate interstate commerce to encompass forcing citizens to purchase products that they may not want or need.                
                

            
                Does our constitution give Congress the authority to compel citizens to purchase government approved goods and services against their will? Is Congress’ commerce power so broad that it permits the federal government to punish its citizens with a monetary penalty if citizens decide they do not want to purchase the product Congress has deemed to be mandatory? No matter what spin the government tries to put on this case this is the critical issue that needs to be answered by the court.                
                

            
                NFIB joined the lawsuit along with the states because our members, small-business owners nationwide, strongly believe that the constitution does not grant Congress this type of authority over how citizens choose to manage their independent lives. They recognize this is a slippery slope and do not want the federal government in the business of determining what private products or services citizens must purchase.                
                

            
                Proponents of the health care law, along with the administration, have tried to alleviate these fears by arguing that the health insurance market is unique and this uniqueness will somehow prevent Congress from passing similar legislation requiring individuals to purchase other products. But small-business owners, the states, the public, Judge Vinson in Florida and federal district Judge Henry Hudson in Virginia aren’t buying this. If Congress can require citizens to purchase government approved products in the name of health care reform, then there is no legal backstop preventing Congress from regulating citizens to buy other products in the name of any other worthy cause.                
                

            
                A court finding that Congress doesn’t have this authority will not tie Congress’ hands in terms of legislating future health care reforms. The government is correct in arguing that Congress has the authority derived from the Commerce Clause to regulate health insurance companies.                 
                

            
                No one but the administration’s legal team seems to think this is the issue. But regulating insurance companies and the products they sell to willing consumers is not what the individual mandate is all about. It’s about forcing unwilling citizens to purchase insurance products in order to reduce costs for insurance companies and their voluntary customers. These are distinct issues. And they cannot be melded together, from a constitutional stand point, on the grounds that entering into the health care market in one’s lifetime and needing to pay for the services received is inevitable. Many uninsured individuals can and will pay for the health-care services that they will receive, and they cannot be conscripted into the insurance market simply because others will fail to do so.                
                

            
                Congress has the power to regulate the insurance industry; they’ve done so for years. In passing PPACA, they chose to reach further and are now trying to regulate an individual’s personal decision not to participate in the insurance market. This is unprecedented and threatens to undermine any constitutional limits on Congress’ commerce power that exist today.                
                

            
                Congress knew this when they passed the bill, and President Obama knew it when he signed it into law. They also purposively passed the Act without a severability clause and have consistently argued that the individual mandate is integral to how this Act should operate. Yet the administration tries to caveat this argument by claiming that if (and only if) the court finds the mandate to be unconstitutional, then the rest of the provisions of the Act could stand on their own. Rings a bit duplicitous doesn’t it?                
                

            
                Despite what the government may want the 11th Circuit to believe, rejecting the government’s arguments and determining that the entire law is unconstitutional is anything but indefensible. NFIB, and the 26 states that have joined this lawsuit, look forward to proving this as our case proceeds.

ObamaCare is already a success,"Just in time for the two-year anniversary of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on the law’s constitutionality this week.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This is a political column. So let’s leave the litigation and questions of constitutionality to the lawyers.                
                

            
                In my world of people and politics there are two relevant issues. First, does the law provide better medical care for Americans? And is it reducing the cost of health care?                
                

            
                While the new law will not be fully implemented until 2014, the parts that have been enacted show that the indisputable, factual answer to both questions is “yes.” But at the moment, the facts do not seem to matter in the court of public opinion. Republican opposition remains as solid today as the day the act was signed into law.                
                

            
                Overall, a March 11 Bloomberg poll found that 37 percent of Americans say it should be repealed, 46 percent want to wait to see how it works and 11 percent think it should be left just the way it is.                
                

            
                The Wall Street Journal reported last week that 50.5 percent of all Americans oppose the law. That is almost exactly the same level of opposition as there was in 2010. One aspect of that opposition that needs to be highlighted is that more than 20 percent of Americans are opposed because they want the law to do more. Specifically, they want it to include a public option for insurance coverage to put more pressure on insurance companies to lower their rates and requirements for coverage.                
                

            
                Still, according to the Journal’s in-depth reporting, the act’s biggest failure so far concerns a temporary plan to offer coverage to uninsured people before the full law takes effect in 2014. Costly premiums and tight rules for enrollment have led to fewer people than expected signing up. And some states have run out of money for the plan where people have signed up.                
                

            
                Another problem cited by critics is that thousands of companies have found it difficult to get insurance, especially for part-time workers, under new rules limiting the ability of insurers to set ceilings for annual claims and payments.                
                

            
                That’s it. Those two small areas are identified as the law’s big problems. That is the heart of the criticism.                
                

            
                There are other valid criticisms out there, but all of it amounts to nothing compared to the law’s success.                
                

            
                Already, the Obama health care reform has succeeded in preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parent’s health insurance until they turn 26. And many other parts of the law have begun to improve the lives of millions of Americans.                
                

            
                For example, it already requires insurance companies to provide coverage for preventive services such as immunization, screenings and counseling services. In 2011, almost 33 million Medicare beneficiaries and 54 million Americans with private insurance used these services for free. Starting this summer, millions of women will be able to have free mammograms and health counseling.                
                

            
                The Act also closed the costly prescription drug coverage gap in Medicare Part D, more commonly known as the “doughnut hole.” Four million seniors and disabled citizens have saved an estimated $3.2 billion on prescription drugs. More savings are ahead as the law becomes fully implemented.                
                

            
                Americans enrolled in Medicare Advantage — or “Medicare Part C” — have had their premiums lowered by 16 percent since 2010, giving seniors access to inexpensive, quality health care.                
                

            
                Also, due to new enforcement powers given to the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare claims were stopped in 2011. This constitutes the single largest sum ever recovered in a single year from individuals and companies attempting to defraud the American taxpayer.                
                

            
                The bottom line is the reforms are leading to higher-quality care and increasing consumer protection while bending the cost curve of health care.                
                

            
                Back in 2009, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Congress must pass health care reform so the American people can find out what is in it. This was an unfortunate statement. It led GOP critics to say Democrats want the public to buy the metaphorical “Pig in Poke.”                
                

            
                But based on what the nation has now seen of the law, the pig is looking like a blue-ribbon winner, a good deal for seniors and the middle class. The only question is whether a good idea can survive bad-mouthing from GOP politicians and hard-right politics on the Supreme Court.

Change Comes To the White House?,"The appointments of Gene Sperling as the director of the National Economic Counci and Bill Daley as new Chief of Staff ratify what many have been speculating – the Obama administration is undergoing a decisive and radical change in approach.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Make no mistake, Bill Daley has never been a supporter of the kind of policies President Obama pursued last year. And indeed, in a December 2009 Washington Post Oped, he counseled the administration and the Democratic leadership against moving too far to the left and against overreaching, writing: “either we plot a more moderate, centrist course or risk electoral disaster not just in the upcoming midterms but in many elections to come.”                
                

            
                Daley has long been a supporter business – both as Secretary of Commerce in the Clinton Administration and as a senior executive at JP Morgan. Moreover, he well understands how to bring a perspective on business and finance to a Administration that has been frequently tone deaf.                
                

            
                Daley saw firsthand what President Clinton was able to accomplish during the mid-nineties – both in terms of balancing the budget and reducing the size and scope of government – and can be expected to follow a similar approach.                
                

            
                Look for the State of the Union Address to be the initial focal point of the re-positioning for the administration, followed by the February 7th speech to the Chamber of Commerce.                
                

            
                Indeed, it can be expected that President Obama will announce some serious new business-friendly incentive programs to help stimulate job creation at a time when the Administration has recognized – albeit belatedly – that it needs to change its focus to jobs and the economy.                
                

            
                Gene Sperling, one of the principle architects of the recent tax-cut deal with the Republicans, is a fellow Clinton Administration alumnus from the era of Newt Gingrich -- when similar deals were negotiated with the Republicans.                
                

            
                Sperling understands one fundamental fact. The Democrats need to embrace fiscal discipline if they are to have any chance of winning the 2012 election.                
                

            
                That being said, Sperling also recognizes that if the Democrats do embrace fiscal discipline and promote a social welfare policy that expands rather than retracts the social safety net, they are almost certain to win the battle of public opinion for Independents – especially at a time when the Republicans have become committed to engaging in the same kind of overreaching that the Republicans did in the mid-nineties and arguably that President Obama and the Democratic leadership did during his first two years in office.
Of course this analysis is necessarily tentative.                
                

            
                But with House Republicans scheduling a vote on health care reform allowing no amendments after having excoriated the Democrats for doing the same thing, promising to reduce spending by 100 billion dollars without offering a plan to do this, and passing rules that allow future tax cuts to be enacted without offsetting spending reduction – effectively indicating that they are exempt from deficit reduction – there is substantial evidence over the past week that the Republicans are pursuing policies that are arguably at variance with what they promised.                
                

            
                But with an electorate that is more conservative than it was even two or four years ago and certainly more so than it was during the mid-nineties, as well as a population that is trending away from the northeast and towards the south and southwest --President Obama’s prospects for 2012 have become more and more daunting.                
                

            
                In light of these ideological and population trends that decidedly benefit the GOP, it is all the more important that the president and Democratic leadership need to move decisively back to the center.

JUAN WILLIAMS: What Obama Needs to Do In Tucson,"President Obama has to lose his cool, professorial approach when he speaks to the American family today.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Right now he is being pressured by the likes of Jonathan Alter and others on the left to use his speech in Tucson to castigate far-right vitriol on talk radio and cable news. That strategy would take the president into another of our daily political fights and lower his stature as our national family’s leader during a time of grief.                
                

            
                That is not to advise the president to ignore the heightened polarization in this political age.
There is no getting away from the bitterness that surrounded Congresswoman Gifford's last race in Arizona’s eighth congressional district. -- It would be weak for Obama to fail to understand or acknowledge that there are hard, bitter sentiments on immigration, gun control and fierce anti-government rhetoric in the southern border area of Arizona right now.                 
                

            
                It is important to acknowledge that Rep. Giffords joined the president in taking a stand on health care reform that resulted in attacks on her and that included the military language and martial imagery that is now in dispute.                
                

            
                But the president has to be the leader of everyone in the family. He must acknowledge that expressing valid points of disagreement, including full-throated dissent, is part of the great American tradition. We cannot silence people, even people on the other side of the family table, without losing our stripes.                
                

            
                The president can acknowledge differences around that family table, but he also has to make it clear that there is no one who is not grieving the loss of a 9-year-old girl who wanted to learn about her country’s political process. He has to acknowledge that there is no one in the family who is not praying for Giffords and her family. He has to express admiration for a courageous judge who at every turned worked to keep us safe as a nation ruled by law – not violence and anarchy.                
                

            
                In a Fox News interview with Bill Hemmer, former Bush speechwriter and Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson said there is a proper way for Obama to address the issue of tolerance in the wake of Saturday’s shootings, but cautioned that over-politicizing it would be a serious mistake.                
                

            
                “If you take what is a human virtue, praising a human virtue and try to make it into a political argument, this looks like you are exploiting a tragedy, rather than rising to the moment.”                
                

            
                President Clinton counseled the nation to embrace their anger after the Oklahoma City bombing, but to channel it away from hate and into a search for justice.                 
                

            
                President Reagan spoke to America’ school children after a school teacher died in the Challenger explosion, reassuring them that space exploration remained a national goal and celebrating the American family's tradition of brave explorers.                 
                

            
                In a similar way, President Bush gave what most regard as his most memorable speech at the National Cathedral after 9/11. It was there that he too spoke about the American family's kindness, American love and American perseverance in the face of adversity.                
                

            
                As he prepares to give his speech today in Tucson, it is up to Obama to speak for us as one family and not to fall victim to invitations to further divide, chastise, lecture or worst of all, politicize. His job is to go beyond healing. America is looking for more of what he offered hours after the attack on Saturday: the ability to inspire us and to move beyond this terrible moment as one family.

              Even as Congress debates whether to overhaul the nation’s health care system or to wait for ObamaCare to fail, few lawmakers are talking about the hidden health care crisis many Americans with health insurance are already facing: denied coverage.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While much attention has been paid to rising premiums and pre-existing conditions, a growing number of insured Americans with chronic or persistent conditions—up to 53 million—risk being denied coverage for medications, tests and procedures to treat their illness. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I was recently commissioned to conduct a nationwide poll of insured Americans by the Doctor-Patient Rights Project (DPRP), a new health care advocacy coalition. The results were alarming and disheartening.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            When insurance companies—not doctors—become the arbiters of patient health, no one should be surprised that cost concerns are prioritized. Yet even with losses from ObamaCare mandates, health insurance companies’ net income rose to $13.1 billion in 2016, up 46 percent from the year before.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              Not only did it find that coverage denials for treatment of chronic conditions were widespread and common, the results suggest that those most in need of quality health care—patients treating serious chronic or persistent diseases—are most frequently denied treatment coverage by their insurers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Ironically, these denials worsen the conditions for many patients and create an even larger health care expense either for the insurance provider or for the publicly-funded entitlement programs that are intended to serve those the private insurance system leaves behind.  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While the debate over health care reform has focused largely on increasing the number of people covered by insurance, it has ignored the burden on taxpayers that occurs when insurance providers withhold treatments to consumers who have paid for coverage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              DPRP’s poll found that more than 53 million Americans—nearly one in four with chronic or persistent illnesses—may lack access to essential treatments because their provider denies coverage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Many of the denied consumers DPRP surveyed were denied multiple times and most had to wait more than a month before their insurer responded to their request for coverage of a prescribed treatment. While they waited, nearly a third said their condition worsened.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              When insurance companies—not doctors—become the arbiters of patient health, no one should be surprised that cost concerns are prioritized. Yet even with losses from ObamaCare mandates, health insurance companies’ net income rose to $13.1 billion in 2016, up 46 percent from the year before.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Health insurers managed to sustain their profits by increasing rates, restricting provider networks and limiting plan benefits.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              One tactic, for example, called “therapeutic substitution” but known more commonly as “non-medical switching” allows insurance companies to direct pharmacists to dispense a cheaper, alternative drug in lieu of the medication the doctor prescribed. In many states, it is perfectly legal for pharmacists to make the switch without notifying the patient or the prescribing doctor beforehand.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Another cost-saving tactic insurers use is step therapies, or “fail first” policies, which require patients with a particular condition to take a less expensive medication and document its ineffectiveness before the insurer will pay for the more expensive drug treatment the doctor has prescribed.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In some cases, patients have waited years and been made to take five or six different drugs before gaining access to the recommended medication.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As more consumers experience coverage denials, it is unsurprising that they are rejecting—by wide margins—insurance company interference in treatment decisions.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              DPRP’s poll found that 91 percent of consumers believe insurance providers should not have the final say in medical decision-making and should play either a secondary role or no role at all in making treatment decisions, the largest consensus the survey uncovered.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Even if Republicans are successful at repealing ObamaCare’s individual and employer mandates and reducing federal subsidies, it will do little to address the health care concerns of many Americans who have coverage, but have no guarantee it will be there when they need it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              From a simple economic perspective, consumers who are denied the coverage they have purchased, and whose conditions deteriorate as a result, become greater burdens on their health plans or on the taxpayer-funded health care safety net.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Consequently, Congressional efforts to reform the nation’s health care system have little chance of succeeding until legislators address the hidden health care crisis plaguing those who are ostensibly already covered.

JUAN WILLIAMS: ObamaCare vs. the GOP -- Score One for the White House,"When it comes to health care reform it is amazing how times change – how polls change – how politics stays the same.
A year ago today , when President Obama signed his national health care plan into law the polls showed most American opposed to it. The bitterness born of phony charges of “death panels,” angry seniors complaining about possible cuts in Medicare benefits and Tea Party marchers screaming at members of Congress had much of the nation in a tizzy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Now public opinion on the bill has taken on a sunny outlook. More Americans have a favorable view of the bill than have an unfavorable view. According to a Gallup poll earlier this month, 46% of Americans think it was a “good thing” while 40% think it was a “bad thing” with 10% undecided.                
                

            
                But as I mentioned, while the polling on Obama’s health care reform may have changed in the last year, the politics have not changed.                
                

            
                The lack of credible Republican alternatives for fixing a broken health care system that was driving big business and families into financial trouble has not changed. When asked what they do would instead, the GOP responds with the same tired, discredited talking points they used one year ago.                
                

            
                They still talk about the need for tort reform even though medical malpractice insurance premiums account for less than one percent of all health care costs. They still talk about the need for competition across state lines even though this would create a veritable race to the bottom as insurance companies are sure to move to the states with the least regulation so they can provide the lowest quality of coverage at the cheapest price.                
                

            
                The GOP has also derided the law as unconstitutional because it effectively forces people to buy health insurance ignoring the fact that government makes everyone pay taxes, issues everyone a Social Security card, and has been forcing people to buy auto insurance for decades. Republican state Attornies General have their knickers in a knot over this and their lawsuits will likely end up in the Supreme Court. The only way the court rules against the new health care plan is if the vote is along purely partisan lines and that will be a bigger tragedy for the court than for the rest of the nation.                
                

            
                The bigger issue on the table at the moment is that House Republicans have not passed a single alternative health care reform bill since they have been in charge but they have passed bills to repeal and defund the law. All of these bills, however, are dead on arrival in the Senate making the whole exercise futile and symbolic.                
                

            
                At a meeting of the nation’s governors last month, President Obama called the GOP’s bluff on health care. He challenged GOP governors -- like South Carolina’s Nikki Haley and New Jersey’s Chris Christie who have echoed party line complaints against what they call “ObamaCare” -- to come up with their own health care plans that meet the goals of the Affordable Care Act.                
                

            
                He challenged the governors, saying, ""I am not open to re-fighting the battles of the last two years, or undoing the progress that we’ve made. But I am willing to work with anyone — anybody in this room, Democrat or Republican, governors or member of Congress — to make this law even better; to make care even better; to make it more affordable and fix what needs fixing.""                
                

            
                That includes not driving up the deficit. So the president opened the door to the states, as what he called the laboratories of democracy, putting their own ideas on the table for reducing costs, increasing access and improving quality.                
                

            
                Since then, the silence has been deafening and the American people are beginning to see that the GOP really doesn’t have any alternative ideas on health care that fit the bill.                
                

            
                Keep in mind that many of the most consequential parts of the Obama health law will not take effect until 2012, 2013 and 2014. Keep in mind that several companies have had to request waivers to continue coverage for low-income workers. The health care bill is still a work in progress. The jury will be out until at least 2014 on the public reaction to the full implementation of the law. But a year ago the critics predicted the sky was about to fall and lack of public support for health care reform would doom President Obama. It didn’t. Obama’s latest approval numbers are about 50 percent and health care is nowhere near a dominant, doom issue.                
                

            
                For the sake of the Republican presidential nominee who will have to debate Obama on health care during the 2012 campaign next year, they had better come up with some. Oh, wait, Mitt Romney did just that when he was governor of Massachusetts. And now he is having to distance himself from his signature accomplishment because the official Republican stance remains to use that issue as a political truncheon to beat up the President.                
                

            
                Well, maybe now Obama can get some medical help.

"BERNARD GOLDBERG: Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the Race Card and President Smith","Let’s count the number of people who think Donald Trump is a racist. On second thought, let’s not. We’ll be here all day. But a short list includes Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, David Letterman, Bob Schieffer, some guy named Ed Schultz who screams a lot on MSNBC, and Chris Mathews who says Trump is appealing to “right-wing rubes” who “just don’t like him [Obama] because he’s black.”                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Even Seth Meyers, the ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian who hosted the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday night, took a jab at The Donald, who was in the audience. ""Trump said recently that he has a great relationship with the blacks,"" Meyers told the crowd.                
                

            
                ""But unless the Blacks are a family of white people, I'll bet he's mistaken.""                
                

            
                Yes, they’re all liberals and liberals tend to see racism all over the place. It’s one of the things that make them feel morally superior to everyone who doesn’t see racism all over the place. It’s one of the ways liberals tell black people, “We’re the good white people. So please don’t blame us for the past.”                
                

            
                The ammo Trump handed his critics started with his fascination with Barack Obama’s birth certificate. At the Correspondents' dinner, Mr. Obama, comedian-in-chief for the evening, returned the fire. ""Donald Trump is here tonight,"" the president said. ""Now I know that he's taken some flak lately, but no one is prouder to put this birth certifcate to rest than The Donald. Now he can get to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing.""                
                

            
                Big laughs from the journalists and their guests.                
                

            
                But some others who had The Donald in their cross-hairs weren't laughing -- not after Trump said that Mr. Obama should get “off his basketball court or whatever he is doing at the time” and pressure OPEC to lower gas prices. And not when he wondered out loud whether Barack Obama got crummy grades at Columbia and still managed, somehow, to get into Harvard Law. Can you say affirmative action?                
                

            
                On ""The View,"" Joy Behar said, “It’s very racist. He can’t fathom that a black man could be that smart. That’s what’s behind this.”                
                

            
                Whoopi Goldberg said, “I’m getting tired of trying to find reasons not to think of stuff as being racist. Being black, when you say, ‘You know, this is racist,’ 9,000 people say, ‘Oh, no, you’re just playing the race card!’ Well, you know what? I’m playing the damn card now!”                
                

            
                Bob Schieffer of CBS News said, “That’s just code for saying he got into law school because he’s black. This is an ugly strain of racism that’s running through this whole thing.”                
                

            
                David Letterman said, “It’s all fun, it’s all a circus, it’s all a rodeo, until it starts to smack of racism. And then it’s no longer fun.”                
                

            
                Ed Shultz kept it short and sweet: “I think Donald Trump is a racist.”                
                

            
                Let’s see if I have this right: It’s racist if Donald Trump questions Barack Obama’s academic credentials, if he wonders what kind of grades he got in college — but it was perfectly okay for liberals to make fun of President Bush because of his so-so grades at Yale. Really?                
                

            
                Of course it’s not just what Donald Trump said about Mr. Obama’s grades. The fact is if you say just about anything negative about President Obama there’s a good chance you’re going to be called a racist. Against his stimulus bill? You’re probably a racist. Against ObamaCare. Yup, you’re a racist. And it started even before he was elected.                
                

            
                Back in 2008, when Mr. Obama was running for president, Jacob Weisberg wrote a piece for Slate, the online magazine, which ran under this headline: If Obama Loses Racism is the only reason McCain might beat him                
                

            
                Are there some racists out there who hate Barack Obama simply because he’s black. Sadly, yes. Are the birthers, especially the ones who still don’t believe Barack Obama was born in the United States, unbearably stupid. Yes again.                 
                

            
                In a country of more than 300 million people, there are going to be some stupid bigots in the crowd. But the haters don’t begin to represent all, or most, or even a significant percentage of the president’s critics. The nuts and the haters play at the fringe.                
                

            
                And whatever one may think of Donald Trump, he is no racist. His many New York liberal friends would have spotted it years ago if he was, and would have dropped him like the proverbial bad habit.                
                

            
                Yet, even smart liberals apparently can’t fathom that it might be Mr.Obama’s liberal policies that Donald Trump and the vast majority of conservatives don’t like, not the color of his skin. So let’s make it easy for my liberal friends. Let’s play pretend.                
                

            
                Let’s pretend that two years ago voters elected America’s first black president. Except this one is a Republican and as conservative as Rush Limbaugh. Let’s call him President Smith.                
                

            
                President Smith is against raising taxes on the wealthy. He’s against massive health care reform that forces everyone who can afford it to buy an insurance policy. He’s against going on a world tour apologizing for America’s supposed sins. He’s for lowering taxes on individuals and businesses. He’s for cutting federal spending to get control of both the short term deficit and the long term national debt. He thinks citizens should have the right to own a gun and he’s against any federal money going to pay for abortions – or NPR.                
                

            
                Okay, here’s the question: Are we supposed to think that Donald Trump or any other critic of President Obama would condemn our pretend President Smith because he’s an African-American? I don’t think so. Not even if he had a Muslim-sounding first and middle name. Not even if his father was born in Kenya. Not even if he had questionable grades way back in college and liked to play basketball. My guess is the overwhelming percentage of conservatives would be thrilled that they finally, at long last, had a true-blue conservative back in the White House and couldn’t care less if he was black.                
                

            
                And who would be criticizing our make-believe President Smith for his hard right positions. Not Donald Trump. Liberals would, that’s who.                
                

            
                Does that make them racists? After all, Mr. Smith is black?

5 reasons ObamaCare is already good for you,"This week, the nine Justices of the Supreme Court have been listening to oral arguments about the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                According to polls, 56% of Americans favor repealing the health care reform law. Then again, a decision on fundamental rights and constitutionality should not be a popularity contest. What’s more, according another poll, 1 in 7 Americans believes the Supreme Court has already repealed the Affordable Care Act. So much for polling.                 
                

            
                How’s about, instead, we look at some facts:

1. Millions of Americans have already benefited from ObamaCare

In 2011, an estimated 86 million Americans used provisions in the Affordable Care Act to get preventative care through their insurance plans, care that insurance companies previously subjected to co-pays or deductibles but now must provide for free. Over 2.5 million seniors have saved an estimated $1.5 billion thanks to prescription drug discounts included in health care reform.                 
                

            
                At least 2.5 million young people now can stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26. And 4 million small businesses can now claim a tax deduction for providing health insurance to their employees, which so far over a quarter-million small businesses have claimed, providing insurance for 2 million workers.

2. The law won’t fully take effect until 2014

It’s amazing all the pre-emptive attacks on a law that, for the most part, hasn’t gone into effect yet. You can check out this timeline of the various provisions of the Affordable Care Act and when they will take effect.                 
                

            
                The controversial “individual mandate” at the center of the Supreme Court arguments this week doesn’t kick in until 2014. What this means is that the cost containment provisions in the Affordable Care Act haven’t gone into effect yet either, and meanwhile critics are attacking the law based largely on hypothetical future predictions.                 
                

            
                In fact, on Monday, the Supreme Court considered whether interest groups or individuals can file suit against a provision in the law that hasn’t even been enforced yet.                
                

            
                3. The individual mandate was originally a Republican idea.

Recently, President Obama’s senior adviser David Plouffe called Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney “the godfather of the individual mandate.” At a GOP primary debate in 2011, Romney said, “We got the idea of an individual mandate…from [Newt Gingrich], and [Newt] got it from the Heritage Foundation.”                 
                

            
                In fact, the idea of requiring businesses or individuals to provide and pay for health insurance traces at least as far back as Richard Nixon, who in 1974 proposed a mandate that “every employer would be required to offer all full-time employees the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan,” the insurance plan Nixon was pushing.                 
                

            
                In 1989, Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation shifted the conservative frame from an employer mandate to an individual mandate, writing:                
                

            
                If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance. If we find that he has spent his money on other things rather than insurance, we may be angry but we will not deny him services—even if that means more prudent citizens end up paying the tab…. A mandate on households certainly would force those with adequate means to obtain insurance protection, which would end the problem of middle-class “free riders” on society’s sense of obligation.                
                

            
                Incidentally, Butler has recently tried to renounce his invention of the individual mandate, but it appears to me that his reasoning reads something like, “I was for it when it was a Republican idea and am against it now that Democrats embraced it.”                
                

            
                4. The Congressional Budget Office recently cut health care reform’s cost estimates.

Conservatives have relied on apples-to-oranges accounting gimmicks to suggest the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently doubled the cost estimates for the Affordable Care Act.                 
                

            
                In fact, the CBO adjusted its estimates to say the Affordable Care Act will cost less than originally projected. Moreover, the CBO has said that repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit by $210 billion.                
                

            
                5. Something had to be done about health care

The fact is, almost three-quarters of Americans saw health care reform as an urgent priority in the fall of 2009.                 
                

            
                President Obama had a plan.                 
                

            
                Republicans did not.                 
                

            
                Still today, the president is trying to adapt and confirm the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to meet the needs of all Americans while keeping costs down. Republicans are simply putting forward another budget that slashes Medicare and middle class benefits while giving more tax breaks to the rich.                 
                

            
                At the end of the day, while Americans are still on the fence about the Affordable Care Act as a blanket concept, when asked about particular remedies that the law includes, the public is overwhelmingly supportive.                 
                

            
                This suggests that the president has a messaging problem, not a policy problem --- whereas the Republicans simply lack any substantive alternative, let alone a popular one.                
                

            
                All of the above suggests that the current fight over health care reform has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act and everything to do with the president who signed it.                 
                

            
                Never mind the fact that the law already shows promising and valuable impact even before it’s fully in effect. Never mind the fact that cost estimates are dropping and, starting in 2014, the law will contain overall health care costs that are crippling our household budgets.                 
                

            
                Never mind the fact that the central component of the law was a Republican idea. Conservative ideologues are willing to sacrifice much-needed health care reform and the well-being of millions of Americans who don’t have health insurance or are being denied care because of pre-existing conditions, lifetime caps on spending or other injustices -- all for the sick goal of undermining President Obama.

Fortunately, about a third of the country -- moderate and swing voters -- haven’t made up their mind and are ready to listen to the president, who needs to a better job in the 2012 campaign of defining the benefits of his health care reform. But especially when faced with the alternative -- a Republcan Party increasingly concerned only with the health and well-being of the 1% -- voters will back the president and their own best interest to have health and prosperity for all Americans.

How Obama Can Avoid Crashing and Burning On Health Care,"President Obama's health care reform effort has lost air speed and altitude. Democratic passengers aboard the aircraft are yelling ""Pull up! Pull up!"" as the oxygen masks fall. They better breathe deep -- regaining a safe flying elevation is going to be difficult.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                By now it is clear that a ""public option"" doesn't have the votes to pass in the Senate. -- The administration all but said point blank last weekend that if it didn't have the votes, they'd throw it overboard in favor of getting something, anything, passed.                
                

            
                That prompted howls from people who a) seriously believe it's the best solution and b) have staked their legislative lives on it. It's hard to tell if the far left is serious about ""sitting out the next election"" as one of the union group claimed this week. Regardless, pent up frustrations are boiling over and lots of people are being scalded -- including the president himself, judging by his approval numbers. They are all on the same flight path as the health care effort.                
                

            
                This situation reminds me of the immigration reform effort President Bush attempted in his second term. It wasn't the Democrats who blocked that effort -- Republican infighting did it for them. While the GOP has vigorously defended its position and pointed out the holes in the reform plan as written, what's really brought this down is that the Democrats can't agree with one another on what they are for and they can't answer basic questions about how much it will cost and whether they'll really be able to keep the coverage they like and the doctor they trust.                
                

            
                So what can the administration do now? I still believe the president could do something dramatic and regain the upperhand. For example, he could say something like this...                
                

            
                ""I campaigned on a platform of changing the way Washington does business. What we have seen this summer is not change -- it is business as usual. And it's not getting us anywhere.                
                

            
                ""If it's true that we all believe we need reform to improve the health care system -- and despite partisan attacks from both sides, I believe that most people do want to achieve changes that will help provide coverage for more people and reduce costs -- then I am willing to ask Congress to tear up the current bill and to work with me to rewrite one that will accomplish our goals.                
                

            
                ""I am asking the Democratic and Republican leadership to meet with me on September 15 -- where we will work all day if we have to -- to agree on a set of guiding principles and redlines that would be used to draft a new bill. This process would be transparent, and I am committed to answering the questions Americans will have in the greatest detail possible. I believe that regrouping in this way we will be able to show that we can change Washington -- yes we can.""                
                

            
                Ok, so I'd drop that last phrase, but I was in the groove. I don't know anyone who wouldn't admire the president for this type of bold action. And even if it ultimately didn't succeed, it's better than it's better than crashing and burning.

"Don't Be Fooled, Democrats Want Funding for Abortion to Be Part of Health Care Reform","During his speech to Congress on September 9, 2009, President Obama radically departed from his former promises to Planned Parenthood when he stated: “under our [health care reform] plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.” He did not explain how this would be accomplished when, at the time that he gave that speech, none of the five versions of health care reform legislation on Capitol Hill prohibited federal funding of abortion -- and two expressly included it.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Nearly three months later, abortion funding remains one of the most hotly debated issues in health care reform, largely because President Obama has not followed through on his promise to ensure that abortion funding is not in the bill. In fact, he offered no opinions on specific abortion-related amendments until the Stupak-Pitts amendment was added to H.R. 3962 on the House Floor.                 
                

            
                Now, however, he has echoed the mantra of the abortion lobby and pro-abortion members of Congress, stating, “there needs to be some more work before we get to the point where we're not changing the status quo.”                
                

            
                In reality, pro-life members of Congress carefully crafted the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, added to H.R. 3962 with the support of 64 democrats, to mirror the Hyde Amendment which has applied to programs funded through the Labor, Health and Human Services (LHHS) Appropriations Bill since 1976. In contrast, the pro-abortion “Capps amendment,” a version of which is currently in the Senate bill, expressly provides for federal funding of abortion and private insurance plans that cover abortion, flouting over 30 years of federal policy.                
                

            
                The fact that the Stupak-Pitts amendment, not the Capps amendment, maintains existing law can be established from studying the Hyde Amendment and similar laws that apply to other programs.
The Hyde Amendment prohibits federal funds that are appropriated through the LHHS appropriations bill from being used to pay for abortion and prevents federal funds from being used to subsidize health care plans that offer abortion coverage.                
                

            
                In other words, programs like Medicaid cannot directly pay for abortions or subsidize private plans that include abortion coverage. The Stupak Amendment applies exactly the same principles to the new programs created by H.R. 3962. Just as Medicaid dollars cannot be used to subsidize private insurance plans that cover abortions, neither can the new affordability credits created by health care reform.                
                

            
                Other government programs apply these principles to federal funds as well. The Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program has a longstanding restriction on abortion funding and coverage. The current law provides: “No funds appropriated by this Act shall be available to pay for an abortion, or the administrative expenses in connection with any health plan under the Federal employees health benefits program which provides any benefits or coverage for abortions.”                
                

            
                Importantly, even as President Obama and the Democratic Congressional leadership are professing their desire to maintain the status quo, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out the Fiscal Year 2010 Financial Services Appropriations Bill (S. 1432) without the provision restricting abortion coverage in the FEHB Program.                
                

            
                Perhaps that is why Democrats do not want the Stupak-Pitts Amendment to be part of health care reform – it contradicts their grand plan to change the law on federal funding for abortion.
A simple survey of other changes and proposed changes to abortion-related laws during the first year of Obama’s presidency and the 111th Congress supports this theory – President Obama repealed the Mexico City policy and there is movement in the Senate to codify that repeal; Congress rejected the “Wicker Amendment” to prevent federal funding of the U.N. Population Fund which has an admittedly pro-abortion agenda; the House passed the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act without the “Dornan Amendment” to prevent all Congressionally appropriated funds from paying for elective abortions in Washington, D.C. and the list goes on.                
                

            
                Do we really trust President Obama and the Democratic Congressional leadership to safeguard the “status quo” on federal funding of abortion? Their actions so far in this Congress more than suggest that they are right on board with the pro-abortion lobby’s plan to mainstream abortion as health care, entitled to federal subsidization like any other surgical procedure. The vast majority of Americans disagree. That is why members of Congress who professes to oppose taxpayer funded abortion must insist that the Stupak-Pitts language remains in the final health care reform bill, and reject any disingenuous “compromises” offered by their pro-abortion colleagues.

"Jobs Up, Unemployment Down -- The Numbers Prove U.S. Economy Is Finally Picking Up Steam","Friday, the Labor Department reported the economy added 216,000 jobs in March. After adding 194,000 jobs in February, this indicates the economy is finally accomplishing momentum. First quarter growth will likely be a bit higher than 3 percent.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Unemployment ticked a notch lower to 8.8 percent on the strength of jobs growth. Unlike past months, this improvement could not be attributed to adults leaving the labor force of emigration.                
                

            
                These gains are in sharp contrast to weaker gains the previous 13 months, and largely resulted from stronger, potentially self-sustaining private sector jobs growth.                
                

            
                As measured by GDP, the economic recovery began in July 2009; however, the economy did not begin adding jobs until January 2010, and gained only 76,000 jobs a month through January 2011. Too many of those jobs gains were created by stimulus spending, temporary business services, and health care and social services, which are heavily subsidized by federal and state governments. Job gains in the core private sector—private employment less temporary business services, and health care social services and temporary business services--averaged only 47,000 a month.                
                

            
                Core private sector jobs are so important, because those have the potential to set off a virtuous cycle of hiring, consumer spending and more hiring. In March and February, this barometer of private sector vitality gained 157,000 and 183,000 new positions, respectively. Similarly strong core private sector gains will be needed to continue adding 200,000 or more new jobs each month going forward.                
                

            
                The jobs drought may finally be over but important challenges remain.                
                

            
                Gains in the range of 200,000 a month are not enough to push unemployment down to acceptable levels. Continued dependence on foreign oil, the growing trade deficit with China, and health care and tax policies that penalize the location of businesses in the United States are responsible for slower jobs creation than has been accomplished during past recoveries and that could still be achieved.                
                

            
                The economy must add 13 million private sector jobs over the next three years—360,000 each month—to bring unemployment down to 6 percent. Core private sector jobs must increase at least 300,000 a month to accomplish that goal.                
                

            
                The economy is expanding at a 3 percent annual rate and this is barely enough to hold unemployment steady, because the working age population increases 1 percent a year, and productivity advances about 2 percent. Growth in the range of 4 to 5 percent is needed and possible to get unemployment down to 6 percent over the next several years.                
                

            
                Coming out of a deep recession, growth of 4 to 5 percent a year is certainly possible. However, continued dependence on high priced foreign oil, the growing trade deficit with China, and health care and tax policies that penalize the location of businesses in the United States are responsible for slower jobs creation than has been accomplished during past recoveries and that could still be achieved.                
                

            
                Simply put, more jobs could be created by drilling for more domestic oil now, which would keep money here that American drivers send to the Middle East; taxing dollar-yuan conversion to offset China’s undervalued currency and 35 percent subsidy on its exports; genuine health care reform that lowers drug, insurance administration and tort burdens rather than subsidizing a system that costs 50 percent more than private systems in Germany and elsewhere; and replacing the corporate income tax and elements of the personal income and social security tax with a value-added tax.

Obama's Medicaid Provisions Are an Albatross to Economic Recovery,"Republicans are aiming to defund parts of the Obama health plan that don’t take effect until 2014, but some of the legislation’s most ruinous provisions are hurting states right now.

Medicaid provisions tucked into the president’s health care legislation are busting state budgets. These measures are becoming a key obstacle to lowering our high unemployment rate.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The Obama team has backed itself into a corner when it comes to Medicaid’s financing. They pinned a good portion of the president’s health care legislation -- and his promise to cover more of the chronically uninsured -- on a dramatic expansion in the Medicaid rolls.                
                

            
                Now, the Obama administration is unwilling to give states the flexibility that they need in order to cut Medicaid eligibility and downsize their Medicaid programs. But this is the only way that states can preserve benefits for the neediest recipients and avert budget disasters.                
                

            
                The administration’s obstinacy was made clear last week when Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sent a letter to states telling them to pound sand when it came to modifying their Medicaid programs. She laid out a list of “suggestions” states can employ to reduce their Medicaid spending. But absent was what the states really need -- freedom from Washington to administer the Medicaid program as the governors see fit.                
                

            
                The secretary’s ""suggestions"" were mostly old ideas plucked from past failures. These include measures such as scaling back optional services like adult dental care and encouraging use of generic medicines. Most of these are small items. Many have already been implemented. Given the magnitude of the states’ budget woes; these measures amount to weak tea.                
                

            
                This month, Jan Brewer of Arizona became the first governor to request what most of the states really need -- a waiver from HHS freeing the states from an Obamacare provision known as the maintenance of effort requirements. This is a mandate that forces states to maintain their current Medicaid rolls until 2014 for adults and 2019 for children. If the states trim programs, they end up forfeiting all of Medicaid’s federal matching funds.                
                

            
                The Obama team doesn’t want to see Medicaid shrunk as a matter of liberal principles. But their inflexibility is also a function of their fiscal prudence at the expense of the states. The problem is that Obamacare is written in a way that puts people who are new to Medicaid in 2014 entirely on the federal tab. So anyone dropped from the program now would return in 2014, only this time the federal government would pick up the entire cost of their care instead of splitting it with the states. In other words, the administration faces a stark choice when it comes to Medicaid: Either blow up the state budgets, or bust the federal tab.                
                

            
                Absent flexibility on the “maintenance of effort” requirements, states are going to be forced to embrace ultimately losing measures such as imposing sharp cuts to what they pay providers. This will force doctors out of the Medicaid program, making access even more difficult for recipients. It will push Medicaid still further down the road of being an empty benefit that leaves recipients with a list of covered services but no places to get care from.                
                

            
                Medicaid’s budget problems will only worsen since Congress is unlikely to extend the higher federal Medicaid contribution beyond its June 30 expiration. This bolus of stimulus funding from 2010 allowed states to gorge on federal Medicaid dollars. Now that trough has run out.                
                

            
                In the end, states are going to be forced to cut other state programs to preserve their expanded Medicaid rolls. State workers are going to feel the brunt of this hardship. They will see their jobs “downsized” to pay for wrecked state Medicaid programs at the very time that the Obama team is trying to reverse the economy’s sagging employment figures.                
                

            
                Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, says state austerity measures alone may add as much as 0.25 percentage point to the unemployment rate this year. This could make the difference between ending 2011 with unemployment above or below 9 percent, and 8 percent by the end of 2012. The state workforce reductions, according to Zandi, could top 600,000 jobs in the fiscal year that starts July 1.                
                

            
                State labor forces are bloated, but smart government reform -- not stopgap measures to plug Medicaid -- should drive streamlining. Some political analysts say that the president’s chances for re-election turn, in part, on his getting unemployment below 8 percent by the 2012 election cycle. Health care reform was supposed to be the president’s signature achievement. The political irony is that it has become an albatross to any economic recovery.

Not a New Deal But a BAD Deal,"OK, after you blow through the first stimulus package, what should the next attempt at economic recovery look like? The now-notorious Joe Biden says that the president and his advisers ""misread"" the economy. But actually, that's not quite right: What you see depends on where you look. The Obama administration did fine by Goldman Sachs over the last six months; the Wall Street firm-- home to so many past, present, and future Treasury officials-- announced profits of $3.4 billion for the second quarter. So the Upper East Side of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn. are doing just fine. But elsewhere, nationwide, unemployment has shot up to 9.5 percent. Whoever thought that a liberal Democratic president would worry more about Wall Street than Main Street?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Now Warren Buffett, a strong Obama supporter, compares the stimulus package enacted in February to ""Viagra"" and ""candy,"" predicting that unemployment will hit 11 percent.                
                

            
                These gloomy points were further underscored by Mortimer Zuckerman, the real estate/media mogul, whose a editorial last week for The Wall Street Journal appeared under the ominous headline, ""The Economy Is Even Worse Than You Think.""                
                

            
                Zuckerman cites a grim armada of statistics to bolster his argument, the most telling of which is that the average work week for private-sector employees slipped to just 33 hours, the lowest level since the government began tracking such data 45 years ago. That is, more and more ""employed"" people are really only able to work part time. Meanwhile, hourly compensation is flat, averaging $18.53 an hour in June. So do the math: Declining working hours, multiplied by flat wages, equals declining income--the further erosion of the American Dream.                
                

            
                And in his grim litany, Zuckerman doesn't even mention the ""cap-and-trade"" legislation the Obama administration has already pushed through one house of Congress; that bill would cost the economy millions of jobs.   Fortunately, Alaska governor Sarah Palin addressed that incoming torpedo on the op-ed page of The Washington Post recently; she correctly labels ""cap and tax"" as a way to ""kill responsible domestic energy production or clobber every American consumer with higher prices.""   And of course, to accelerate the wipeout of manufacturing in the Heartland.                
                

            
                So where could new jobs come from? President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers released a cheery report on future employment growth, suggesting that declines in the manufacturing sector should be counterbalanced by increases in the aerospace and pharmaceutical industries.                
                

            
                Oh really?  What happens to the aerospace industry if Obama cuts back on defense spending, as he plans to do, including for the F-22 fighter jet? Consider this headline also from The Washington Post, ""Obama Vows a Veto In Dispute Over F-22s/President Pushing to Close Production Line.""  Not too much hope there.                
                

            
                And what of health care? Not only is health care a desirable good in and of itself, but it is also a natural driver of economic activity, as anyone who lives near a hospital knows.   There are millions of jobs to be found in medicine, from taking care of patients, to inventing cures, to mass-producing medical equipment.                
                

            
                But what if the Obamans succeed in cutting back on health care, in the name of ""controlling costs""?  In the eyes of liberal Democrats, the whole point of putting the government in charge of health care is so that planners in Washington will be able to ""improve"" the system--which, of course, means rationing of one kind or another.   In an article summarizing the White House economic report, The Washington Post's David Cho might have been too polite to say the obvious--that Obamacare will constrict  job growth in the health sector--and so he confines himself to simply noting,  ""The projections do not account for Obama's plan to revamp the U.S. health-care system.""  That is, if Obama gets his way on health care ""reform,"" then rosy scenarios of health-care employment growth will fade to black.                
                

            
                OK, so let's see here: The first stimulus didn't work for anyone except a few favored constituencies. ""Cap and tax,"" if it passes, will strangle the economy; and even if it doesn't pass, the continuing threat of anti-carbon dioxide activism--from litigators, state legislatures, and future Congresses--will cast a dark shadow over future economic activity.   (Ask yourself: Would you build a factory in the same country as Carol Browner?)  And the Obama administration is targeting two economic-driver industries, aerospace and health care, for drastic reductions.                
                

            
                Here's Zuckerman's conclusion:                
                

            
                ""No wonder poll after poll shows a steady erosion of confidence in the stimulus. So what kind of second-act stimulus should we look for? Something that might have a real multiplier effect, not a congressional wish list of pet programs. It is critical that the Obama administration not play politics with the issue. The time to get ready for a serious infrastructure program is now. It's a shame Washington didn't get it right the first time.""                
                

            
                Yes, indeed.  America didn't get a New Deal with Barack Obama, it got a Bad Deal.  But since few wish for a return to the Bush administration, the question is: What do we do next?    What if we want American manufacturing to expand?  What if we want a more robust aerospace industry?  What if we want better medicine?   What if we want ""serious infrastructure,"" as Zuckerman puts it--the kind that creates economic growth?                
                

            
                Obama, in office till at least January 2013--and in charge of Congress till at least January 2011--will get at least one more chance to address these questions.   If he succeeds, great.  But if he fails, then he and his Teleprompter will have to get out of the way and let someone else do the real work of growing the economy."

5 things we should expect from a Romney administration,"Oct. 13, 2012: Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney speaks in Portsmouth, Ohio. 
	                        
	                        	 (AP)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                For the first time, during the presidential debate on October 3 tens of millions of Americans went beyond the sound bites and attack ads and saw Gov. Romney as a candidate and as a person. Until then, others defined Romney. At the debate, he defined himself.  Passionate. Compassionate. Smart. Knowledgeable. A leader. Presidential.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                So what would a Romney presidency look like?                
                

            
                As a Romney supporter, I already have a good idea of what to expect from a President Romney. But like many voters who either already support Romney or are considering Romney, I want to hear more specifics over the course of the presidential debates scheduled for this month.                 
                

            
                Watch the second presidential debate LIVE on Fox News Channel and FoxNews.com beginning at 8:55 pm ET.                
                

            
                Specifically, here is what I want to hear from Romney:                
                

            
                1. How will Romney lead by example?                
                

            
                The former Massachusetts governor is known for being frugal in his everyday life. He does his own laundry and irons his own shirts. He should carry those habits into the White House. Specifically, during the debates he should tell Americans that as we prepare to sacrifice for the next generation, he will lead by example. This isn't a way to cut the deficit. Rather, it's to show that by cutting back on the perks of the presidency -- taxpayer funded vacations, unlimited travel options, big inaugural parties -- that a President Romney appreciates that we're all in this together                
                

            
                2. How will Romney end trillion-dollar deficits?                
                

            
                President Obama promised to cut the deficit in half in four years. But far from halving the deficit, Obama has more than doubled it.                 
                

            
                Romney is a budget hawk and a voracious consumer of data.  He has the training and expertise to explain to Americans how he will do what his predecessor could not.                 
                

            
                During the next two debates, he should give concrete examples of what he would do to pull the country back from the fiscal cliff. He can pore over the inspector general reports from the numerous federal agencies that are always documenting waste and abuse. For example, in 2011 an inspector general's report suggested that one minor policy change would save Medicare over a billion dollars annually  on the costs for just one drug. This is the type of concrete examples voters need to hear.                
                

            
                3. How will Romney keep his promises?                
                

            
                As governor of Massachusetts, Romney had his staff document every campaign promise so that voters could hold him to account. A President Romney should offer the same thing, only he should offer to put his campaign promises on the White House web site where they would be open, transparent, and there would be nowhere to hide. Romney should offer this during the debates, while also pointing out how the media has failed to hold Obama to account for his broken promises. Which could lead to the line: ""I'll do the job the media hasn't done in four years.""                
                

            
                4. Other than the deficit and the economy, what are Romney's top priorities and how will he tackle them?                
                

            
                Voters know that whoever is president next year, he will have to do something about the economy and spending. Those issues will be covered during the debates. But what else would top a Romney administration to-do list? For Obama, it was health care reform. This is an opportunity for Romney to really step outside the box and present a bold agenda to voters: is it immigration reform; Social Security/Medicare reform; or a foreign policy initiative?                
                

            
                5. Explain why an administration lasts four years, not eight.                
                

            
                Obama now argues that he needs another four years to complete his agenda and see results. This opens an opportunity for Romney to remind voters that if a president can't get results in four years, then he shouldn't be given another four years. Romney should make a deal with Americans during the debate: He should present a metric (GDP, employment, etc.) and promise that if he does not meet that metric, then he will not run for reelection. Romney wants to be president to fix things. And a president can fix things in four years.                
                

            
                Our nation faces serious challenges that our political leaders have ignored. Romney's biggest challenge as president will be convincing Americans that we all must share in sacrifice for the next generation. He needs to start persuading us on Tuesday night.

                My business takes me out of the country very often. I was in Mexico last week and listened to the radio and TV when President Obama was talking to young people at the Museum of Anthropology. He was well received by them and I wondered whether he appealed to them as he did to the young people in the United States five long years ago. The broad smile, the inspirational speech, the beautiful setting, all seemed to be just right to deliver a hopeful message.                                             ADVERTISEMENT

                So it was ironic to see him there for a wonderful photo op while trouble was brewing in DC —big trouble. I could be just as critical and cynical as the next guy, but that is not what this is about. I am profoundly troubled by all that is happening under this president’s watch. More than the scandals are the tragic consequences of what has transpired by either negligence, dereliction of duty, or outright malfeasance.                
                

            
                Whether we are talking about the Benghazi tragedy, which appears to be a cover up; the IRS targeting of conservative groups and those who apparently oppose this president; or the massive subpoena of AP phone records and the public handling by this administration, especially by the White House, it is cause to give us all a huge pause. I won’t even go into the lies we were told about the health care reform and the implementation fundraising controversy surrounding Secretary Sibelius.                
                

            
                It is beyond comprehension how this administration has gone so astray. It pains me to even think that we are at the verge of losing the foundation of our existence as a country. The principles on which our country was founded are in danger of being destroyed. More than anything else I am in shock. Yes, there is outrage out there as there should be, and not just from Republicans. Yet what I feel is a considerable sense of sadness.                
                

            
                Finally the press is being awaken as to what has slowly crept up, but only because it finally hit them directly. The media, the greatest apologists for President Obama, have finally realized that their own creation has come back to haunt them. The mere thought that our federal government would threaten one of the most fundamental freedoms –the freedom of the press– should have a chilling effect on the way we look at this president.

                Unhappily it reminds me of the renowned First they came… poem by Pastor Martin Niemöller. First, they went after their opponent; the media not only stayed silent but also enabled them; then they went after their opponent’s supporters via the IRS and the media stood by, but now they are going after the media and that is the most dangerous.                 
                

            
                There are places in this earth where that happens, where it is the way it is. But here in the United States we should not stand idly by; as a matter of fact we should all defend that freedom with our own voices. Too many have died to give us that freedom. It is our sacred duty to defend it, or there will be no one to speak for us.

Obama Needs A Pro-Growth Care Package,"US President Barack Obama speaks on healthcare during a visit to the Children's National Medical Center in Washington on July 20, 2009.        AFP PHOTO/Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                When President Obama decided to make health-care reform his number one domestic priority, he did so knowing that one critical element of this decades-long debate has changed; namely that we are in the midst of the worst economic recession and job market since the Great Depression.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Unfortunately, the critical issues of health-care R&D, job creation and the need for pro-growth strategies as a prerequisite to generating revenue, combating rising sector inflation and contributing to America's economic recovery have largely gone unaddressed. Instead, the administration's focus is on what role, if any, the federal government should play in insuring Americans without coverage. House Democrats introduced legislation with an unprecedented $1.5 trillion price tag last week including a ""public option"" to compete with private plans, paid for by taxing wealthy Americans and imposing penalties on small businesses with payrolls of $250,000 or higher that don't provide health insurance to their employees.                
                

            
                Douglas Elmendorf, director of the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, said about draft legislation, ""We do not see the sort of fundamental changes that would be necessary to reduce the trajectory of federal health spending by a significant amount. And on the contrary, the legislation significantly expands the federal responsibility for health care costs.""                
                

            
                When combined with crippling job forecasts, the stakes couldn't be higher. Without a bi-partisan compromise, he risks a political and economic catastrophe that will threaten his larger domestic agenda and drive away the very investment communities that fund life-saving innovations and treatments.                 
                

            
                President Obama needs to bring all sides together by prioritizing three equally important objectives:                
                

            
                First, making economic growth the centerpiece of a bi-partisan reform package. Unfortunately, Democrats are giving the impression that quantity supersedes quality. By contrast, they could score points on the economy, alleviate growing fears over ""government-run health care"" and help solidify a bi-partisan compromise by tabling the radioactive options - higher taxes, cuts to Medicare, etc. -that will only exacerbate our nation's already precarious economic situation. As President Obama made clear in his speech earlier this year to the American Medical Association, ""this is a test of whether we -Democrats and Republicans alike - are serious about holding the line on new spending and restoring fiscal discipline.""                
                

            
                Second, encouraging private capital investment that will not only drive growth, but help cut costs, restore fiscal discipline and fight chronic diseases. Representative Rangel's (D-New York) idea of increasing taxes during a period of economic softness is a job-killing strategy; instead, we need incentives that give businesses the confidence necessary to both create jobs and invest in next-generation drugs.                
                

            
                Case in point is the debate over establishing an approval pathway for follow-on biologics, the generic version of drugs developed biologically. Policymakers remain divided over the period of data exclusivity during which a follow-on patent applicant could not rely on the innovator's data for approval. The White House, now at odds with Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), favors a seven-year period. Kennedy recently helped push through a 12-year exclusivity period in the Senate Health Committee, consistent with what many economists believe is not only the minimum necessary to help innovators capture a sufficient return, but will encourage long-term investment in a sector that contributed $88.5 billion to the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2006 alone. A seven-year time period, economists contend, will only dry up investment at a time when it is badly needed.                
                

            
                Third, proposing new policies that take the focus off of public vs. private and prioritize small businesses. The notion of giving small business owners a much-needed payroll tax holiday and providing other meaningful incentives to help them achieve the ultimate goal of covering more Americans has surprisingly taken a backseat role. So has the need to bring our nation's health-care system into the 21st Century through greater investment in information technology, arguably one of the most non-partisan and pro-growth elements of the health-care debate.                
                

            
                Even a bi-partisan idea put forth by former Senate Majority Leaders Tom Daschle, Howard Baker and Bob Dole that would create state and regional health insurance exchanges, which have the potential to give individuals and small business owners greater purchasing power, has been pushed to the back of the shelf.                
                

            
                ""If you want to stop this thing dead in its tracks, or dead on arrival, in my view you put the public plan in it,"" Dole said in announcing the idea.                
                

            
                We shouldn't have to make a Hobson's choice. While Congress may decide to raise taxes to increase the number of insured Americans, without a pro-growth agreement it will ultimately fail all of our citizens by further adding to our nation's unemployment woes and eroding the high quality of medical care necessary to ensure that we create jobs and remain competitive in the global marketplace. Stated simply, Democrats and moderate Republicans running for re-election next year cannot afford to accomplish anything less.

President Obama and the State of Our Future,"Those who are ideologically predisposed to criticize President Obama contort themselves to overlook inconvenient facts.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The fact is that, under President Obama’s leadership, we have seen 22 straight months of private sector job growth.                 
                

            
                While Republicans are accusing the President of being a job killer, the fact is that President Obama has created 3.2 million new private sector jobs. More private sector jobs were created in 2011 in America than any year since 2005.

Oddly, Mitt Romney wants to claim credit for a hundred thousand jobs that were created after his Bain investment (and not count the many more jobs he killed but Republicans refuse to be honest about President Obama’s record of creating jobs and, slowly but surely, bringing our economy back from the brink.

Facts don’t lie, folks.

And so, in tonight’s State of the Union Address, our president will accurately lay out the steps he has taken to help our economy recover and the additional steps he plans to take going forward.                 
                

            
                This is what presidents, Republicans and Democrats, have done at such addresses for generations.                 
                

            
                But Republicans, realizing that stubborn and dishonest attacks on Obama’s policy ideas are backfiring on their own party, will make a desperate attempt to portray the president as “campaigning” during the State of the Union. Somehow, what was defensible under George W. Bush is borderline treasonous under Barack Obama.

The fact is that half of voters -- and, importantly, more than half of self-identified independents -- believe that Republicans in Congress are intentionally sabotaging our economy to hurt President Obama’s re-election prospects.

Another poll asked voters which statement they agree with more: “President Obama is making a good faith effort to deal with the country’s economic problems, but the Republicans in Congress are playing politics by blocking his proposals and programs.” Or this: “President Obama has not provided leadership on the economy, and he is just blaming the Republicans in Congress as an excuse for not doing his job.”                 
                

            
                Not only do the majority of voters agree with the first statement over the second, but the difference is more pronounced among moderate and independent voters. Independents favor the first statement by a 54 to 40 margin. Moderates favor the first statement by a 57 to 37 margin. 

In other words, if the majority of Americans believe that President Obama is trying to lead our economy and our nation forward but Republicans are putting politics ahead of patriotism and actively sabotaging our economy, the president is absolutely right to deliver a strong, bold and sharp-elbowed State of the Union Address that calls out Congressional Republicans for blocking every bipartisan idea that crosses their desks and stubbornly refusing to compromise for the good of the nation.                 
                

            
                Frankly, if the president did not deliver such a firm rebuke tonight, that would be a clear failure of leadership.

Republicans will continue to throw every imaginable criticism plus the kitchen sink at our president. Republicans will call Obama “the food stamp president” -- a racially-tinged charge that ignores the fact that food stamp enrollment was twice as high under President George W. Bush.                 
                

            
                Republicans will accuse Obama’s health care reform law of destroying the economy -- even though jobs are rebounding and most of the law won’t take effect until 2014.                 
                

            
                Republicans will say regulation under Obama is stifling the private sector -- even though, in a key report, small business owners across the United States said it was a lack of consumer demand and not regulations that are hurting their business.                 
                

            
                Republicans will keep attacking Obama for raising taxes -- even though not only has he lowered taxes for 99% of Americans but it’s been Republicans who have blocked vital tax breaks for the middle class.

These baseless smears may fire up a small fringe of the anti-Obama Republican base, but the fact of the matter is most Americans care about results and character. V                
                

            
                oters can tell the difference between a president who is making progress turning the economy around and being honest about the obstacles he’s facing versus desperate presidential contenders who want to sling nothing but mud to distract from their decades of failed leadership that put our country in this crisis.

Of course, as we recover from an historic recession with millions of Americans still unemployed or struggling to get by, no one can say that the state of our union is as strong as it should be or needs to be. But it is getting stronger.                 
                

            
                The plan the president will outline tonight will make our nation stronger, instead of turning us back to the dark ages of Republican class warfare and an economy that only works for the 1%, building an American economy for the future on the foundation of American manufacturing and energy innovation, training American workers for good jobs and reinvesting in the values of fair opportunity that built our great nation.                 
                

            
                I'm not saying the president is perfect nor that I or anyone will agree with everything he says tonight, as in the past. But fundamentally, these are good ideas that, frankly, conservatives in Congress would readily support if they came from a Republican president.                
                

            
                For once, it would be nice for Republicans to honestly listen to what President Obama has to say, using their patriotic hearts not their political brains -- offering feedback based on facts and principles, not personal smears and partisanship.                 
                

            
                But either way, make no mistake about it, the majority of American people have been listening carefully to the President all along -- and liking what they hear.

Now They're Blaming Bush for Obama's Campaign Strategy,"Over the weekend, a pair of political pundits – National Journal’s Charlie Cook and the New York Times’ John Harwood -- engaged in some historical revisionism, suggesting President Obama’s emerging campaign strategy was (more or less) a carbon copy of President George W. Bush’s 2004 re-election bid.

Like a lot of revisionist history, there was a surface appeal to their theories. But alas, neither writer got it right. Mr. Bush is not to blame for Mr. Obama’s dash to the far left wing of his party. Mr. Obama is.

Let’s begin with the noted prognosticator and electoral commentator extraordinaire Charlie Cook, who suggested that when “independent voters…viewed Bush with skepticism,” the 2004 reelection “began focusing more on expanding its base than on throwing huge amounts of resources at independent and undecided voters.” Mr. Obama, he opined, is merely doing this year what Mr. Bush did eight years ago.

Uh, no.

If Mr. Bush won re-election by focusing on the Republican Party’s base, exactly how is it that he won 23% more votes than he received in 2000?                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                By focusing on the GOP base, did Mr. Bush (a) nearly erase the gender gap; (b) carry the highest percentage of Hispanic voters for a Republican since exit polls began tracking Latinos; (c) increase his share of the African-American vote by 22%; (d) boost his support among union households by 4 points; and (e) do better among Jewish voters than any Republican since Ronald Reagan swept 49 states in 1984?

Mr. Cook asserts all those gains occurred because the Bush campaign focused on its base rather than throw “huge amounts of resources” at swing voters. That’s news to me.

Mr. Cook described only one leg of the Bush tactical approach. Of course we took steps to energize the Republican base; any incumbent does. But the 2004 Bush re-election also focused a huge amount of attention on persuading independents and swiping “soft” Democrats. The former succeeded so well that Mr. Bush won 48% among independents and 11% of Democrats while Mr. Kerry carried 49% of independents and only 6% of Republicans.

Much of the Bush re-election’s massive volunteer effort was aimed at persuading non-Republicans to support Bush. So was its advertising, including an extensive under-the-radar effort on African-American radio stations that helped, for example, double Mr. Bush’s support among Black voters in Ohio.

Mr. Cook concedes that a “base-only” strategy has its weaknesses and risks, requiring a candidate to place all his political eggs in one political basket. That’s why Mr. Bush’s re-election would have rejected a “base-only” strategy in a nanosecond as politically insane.

Last weekend’s other revisionist journalist is the New York Times’ John Harwood. He, too, suggested Mr. Obama is parroting Mr. Bush’s 2004 strategy, writing that in 2004, “George W. Bush exploited social and national security issues to offset his economic vulnerabilities.”

But what “economic vulnerabilities” does Mr. Harwood have in mind? The average unemployment rate in 2003 was 6% and for 2004, 5.5% (compared to 9.1% today). According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the economy grew 4.7% in 2003 and 6.4% in 2004.                 
                

            
                In the last two quarters, by comparison, the economy has grown at 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent. The 2004 election, in fact, took place in the midst of an unprecedented period of uninterrupted job growth. Mr. Obama is stressing social issues because he wants to downplay the economic ones.

In addition, it wasn’t Mr. Bush who injected social issues – namely gay marriage – into the 2004 campaign. It was instead the Massachusetts Superior Judicial Court with its November 2003 decision legalizing gay marriage in the Bay State. That is what altered the status quo and forced conservatives to react.                 
                

            
                The Massachusetts decision set off a grass roots reaction throughout the country that eventually led 11 states to pass traditional marriage measures by referendum in November 2004.                 
                

            
                It’s also worth noting that the then-president and his 2004 Democratic opponent both supported the traditional definition of marriage, as did Mr. Obama in his 2008 contest.

Third, Mr. Bush had little choice in making national security the focal point of his 2004 campaign. The Democratic opposition already had made it so: it was the number one issue in the 2003 lead-up to their primaries, propelling the little known governor of Vermont to frontrunner status (until his campaign imploded in Iowa).

To suggest Mr. Bush focused on Iraq and the War on Terror to compensate for the economy is laughable. With unemployment low and GDP growth robust, Democrats didn’t want to make the election about the economy. The war was an issue because the Democrats wanted to fight the campaign over it. And Mr. Bush was happy to oblige. We knew he could defeat Senator Kerry on multiple political fronts.

Mr. Harwood did hit the mark on an important aspect of Mr. Obama’s current strategy: the president has suffered an enormous decline among college graduates, independents and young people (his job approval rating among the last group has dropped 30 points since his inaugural).                 
                

            
                But President Obama is pursuing a strategy that is completely at odds with, not similar to, the one pursued by President Bush. And these appeals to class warfare, demands for higher taxes, and slashing attacks on his political opponents are unlikely to get these voters back, no matter where Mr. Obama stands on social issues. These groups were among those most powerfully drawn to the young Illinois senator’s pledge to change Washington by being the president “not of red states or blue states but the United States.”

The latest Obama strategy, though, is to seek to divide Americans in every possible way, including by class and sexual orientation. And so Mr. Obama takes great delight in excoriating “millionaires and billionaires” for their “corporate jets.”                 
                

            
                This weekend he attacked Republicans for not denouncing a couple of people sitting in a debate audience who booed a question on repealing ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" (they did not boo the gay soldier). This is a pitiful (and fruitless) effort to draw attention away from the disastrous effects of his stimulus program, alarm over his spending patterns and deficits, and the huge opposition to his signature achievement, health care reform.

To date Mr. Obama’s re-election strategy is, if anything, an anti-Bush strategy. If an unpaid intern had suggested we do what the Obama campaign is doing, he’d have been demoted. But thankfully no one on the ’04 Bush campaign was that stupid.
