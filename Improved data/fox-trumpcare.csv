Democrat (and ex-CIA): Bogus leaks and what to believe. How to vet your news like an agent,"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s warning about anonymous media reports rightfully calls our attention to a growing crisis: Americans are being overwhelmed by a waterfall of highly questionable leaks about the drama in Washington, D.C.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                Some of the gossip is fairly predictable, like the jockeying of power between White House staffers or dueling Congressmen.
                
                


                
            
                But Rosenstein’s worry is focused on another, more dangerous trend: the unsanctioned release of sensitive or classified information by a group of shadowy sources. 
                
                


                
            
                As a former CIA officer, I share Rosenstein’s concern because I worked with these same types of informants. In the world of espionage, we called them “volunteers.” In short, these people tracked down intelligence officers to peddle information.
                
                


                
            
                In the vast majority of cases, volunteers turned out to be the equivalent of human garbage. On rare occasion, however, they held credible intelligence that altered the course of history.
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Unless the media identifies a source and is honest about their motivations and biases, subsequent reporting is the equivalent of cheap celebrity gossip. Maybe a little truth, but a whole lot of lies.
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
            
                The challenge, then, was to vet each source to decide whether they were a heap of trash or pot of gold. In espionage – as with journalism – officers used a five-step process to sort it all out:
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Identity: First, spies conducted the equivalent of a background check on the volunteer. Can we confirm their job, title, and related work functions? Can they prove their identity?
                
                


                
            
                Unfortunately, the American people have no way to determine if any of the media’s anonymous sources have undergone this basic check. Instead, we have to rely on the integrity of reporters.
                
                


                
            
                Access:  Next, spies worked to confirm a volunteer’s access to the information they’re providing. Do they have reason to have it? Is their access direct (personal) or indirect (through others)? If they’re using subsources, these unnamed figures have to be vetted as well.
                
                


                
            
                Frustratingly, the American people have no window into whether the media has addressed this critical step and, if so, to what degree of professionalism.
                
                


                
            
                Motivations: Spies have to understand why a volunteer is offering their information. If someone is bitter about a job loss, for instance, they might pass along falsehoods or “cherry pick” intelligence in order to get revenge against a boss.
                
                


                
            
                Indeed, most volunteers are motivated by one of four things: revenge, ego, money, or partisanship. For example, NSA’s most recent leaker R. Leigh Winner fits the pattern of partisanship while former FBI Director James Comey’s leak may be explained – in part – by revenge.
                
                


                
            
                Of course, just because volunteers have dubious motivations doesn’t mean we ignore their information. Rather, the media must highlight a source’s likely bias so that viewers and readers might draw their own conclusions.
                
                


                
            
                Sadly, no media outlets have publically taken these steps in recent months.
                
                


                
            
                Corroboration: In the world of espionage, a volunteer’s claims have to be checked against 1) other sources that 2) don’t know of each other’s actions yet 3) share the same information. Relying on single-sourced intelligence is dangerous. That’s largely what drove the disastrous invasion of Iraq in 2003.
                
                


                
            
                Here again, the media has yet to demonstrate that they’ve corroborated any of the information they’ve published. Of course, they’ve promised that they’ve done so but there’s simply no proof. Instead, we have to rely on the honesty and integrity of journalists.
                
                


                
            
                And that brings up the final step in asking whether recently leaked reporting is credible.
                
                


                
            
                Bias: In the world of espionage, officials have to consider whether the officer vetting the volunteer might be biased. In other words, it’s possible that the officer wants the volunteer and their information to be true even if it’s not.
                
                


                
            
                Why? Officers sometimes think they can get a promotion, receive a bonus, or be honored with an award if they find a great volunteer.
                
                


                
            
                At Langley, this rarely occurs. In America’s media, however, it’s depressingly common.
                
                


                
            
                Turn on any TV station or read any article and you’re bound to consume not just facts but also the political agendas of media owners and editors. For instance, data show that The New York Times and Washington Post have a greater bias than Fox News.
                
                


                
            
                Or consider the 2016 election where journalists directed 96 percent of their political giving to my party’s nominee – Hillary Clinton.
                
                


                
            
                While I might like that as a Democrat, I hate it as an American. We need to battle over our political differences through honest debate, not biased journalism.
                
                


                
            
                All of this leaves the average person with a great challenge: What should we believe in the media, especially when it comes to the Trump / Russia allegations? And who should we believe?
                
                


                
            
                Here’s what I’d recommend.
                
                


                
            
                First, Rosenstein is right. Exercise caution when reading stories with anonymous sources and leaked information. Unless the media identifies a source and is honest about their motivations and biases, subsequent reporting is the equivalent of cheap celebrity gossip.
                
                


                
            
                Maybe a little truth, but a whole lot of lies.
                
                


                
            
                Second, be patient with the FBI investigation. The Bureau’s Special Agents are aggressively and fairly investigating the Trump allegations. We should have results by early fall.
                
                


                
            
                When we do, have faith in what we learn. If Trump or his associates are guilty of improprieties, America will demand justice. If Trump is cleared, we will take this drama to where it belongs. The ballot box.
                
                


                
            
                Finally, focus on the news that’s getting less attention but is equally important, like TrumpCare. If you don’t like what you’re seeing in Washington, tell the Democrats to come up with a better plan. Demand something like Our American Oath, which is a vision for the country that I helped draft with pragmatic Democrats and Republicans.
                
                


                
            
                Bottom line: No matter what you read or hear – from Trump or the New York Times – consume your news with a critical eye. It’s our job as citizens to ask tough questions and demand more honest answers.
                
                


                
            
                If we don’t get it, let them hear you. Cancel your subscription. Turn off the TV.
                
                


                
            
                And if it’s a deceitful politician spreading lies, vote them out.

Andrew Tisch: An aging and Alzheimer’s tsunami is about to hit us. Here's what needs to happen right now,"Now Playing                            House Republicans in talks on new health care plan                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Despite the collapse of Republicans’ ObamaCare repeal effort, the health care issue isn’t going away.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The current health care debate in Washington is fundamentally one over who pays. However, it won’t matter whether Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers or individuals pick up the tab, if the most urgent challenge in health care is left out of the next debate in Congress.                
                

            
                In 2010, there were 11.4 million Americans over the age of 80, and by 2050, there will be over 32 million. That growth is a testament to the power of modern medicine and a cause for celebration, except for one problem: One in two people who reach their 80s will get Alzheimer’s, and the American health care system isn’t even remotely equipped to deal with the coming surge.                
                

            
                Leaders in Washington need to start having adult conversations about this rapidly greying population. Otherwise, we’ll all be bankrupt.                
                

            
                The annual cost to care for people with Alzheimer’s and other dementias is already $226 billion, with Medicare and Medicaid picking up 68 percent of the costs.                
                

            
                If recent trends continue, the annual cost of Alzheimer’s could reach $1 trillion, in current dollars, by midcentury, costing Medicare and Medicaid almost $700 billion; approximately one fifth of the federal government’s current budget.                
                

            
                There are two main things Washington should do to deal with this crisis: Drastically increase the amount of federal money going to Alzheimer’s research and give Americans more control over end of life decisions.                
                

            
                When it comes to increasing funding, if ever there was a case of spending a little bit of money now to save a lot later, this is it.                
                

            
                Disease research of all kinds is worthy and important. But Alzheimer’s stands apart for the destruction it wreaks on families and finances.                 
                

            
                Five million Americans currently have Alzheimer’s, and the disease’s impact spreads far beyond those who have it. Every person with Alzheimer’s requires three people—children, spouses, friends and health care workers—to serve as caregivers. This can be a full-time job and enact a significant toll on the caregivers themselves.                
                

            
                Although the National Institutes of Health (NIH) allocated almost $1 billion to Alzheimer’s research last year, funding still lags well behind what researchers need and what other diseases already receive.                
                

            
                The five treatments that are available today only treat symptoms—rather than preventing, slowing or reversing the disease.                 
                

            
                Dr. Greg Petsko of Weill Cornell Medical College believes a significant boost in research funding could lead to breakthroughs in the years ahead.                 
                

            
                “We’ve learned more about Alzheimer’s in the last few years than in the previous few decades combined. But turning this insight into treatments requires more funding for more studies, and researchers tend to go where the money is. If NIH doubled research funding for Alzheimer’s tomorrow, it would kick the whole machinery of grant making and academic and pharmaceutical company research into a higher gear.”                
                

            
                Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of a dozen senators wrote a letter to President Trump imploring him to increase funding for Alzheimer’s research.                 
                

            
                Unfortunately, the president’s budget proposes a staggering 18 percent cut to the NIH budget as part of a broader effort to slash discretionary spending. But there is nothing discretionary about increasing Alzheimer’s research. This is a national and moral imperative.                
                

            
                But more funding alone won’t do it. In order to properly address this crisis, we also need to rethink how much freedom we give individuals over their own end of life decisions: Americans must be empowered to decide when and where quantity and quality of life are most important.                
                

            
                We all know someone with a horror story of a loved one subjected to painful, unwanted and unnecessary treatments in his or her dying days. Many of them are Alzheimer’s patients. It costs people their dignity and is a driver of why one out of every four Medicare dollars—more than $125 billion—is spent in the last year of life.                
                

            
                There is no easy solution to this challenge, but practical and humane answers are available. One proposal from Mount Sinai Health System President Ken Davis would require every new Medicare enrollee to have an advance directive—a written statement of a person’s wishes regarding medical treatment—to ensure their choices are respected if they become unable to communicate them to a doctor.                
                

            
                Last year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authorized patient reimbursement for end of life counseling, including advance directives, but most Americans still don’t have one.                
                

            
                No matter what happens to ObamaCare or TrumpCare or whatever devil-may-care bill emerges from Congress, a potential cure for Alzheimer’s should not go undiscovered for lack of a few billion dollars in a four trillion-dollar annual budget.                 
                

            
                An aging and Alzheimer’s tsunami is about to hit the U.S. health care system and Washington needs to do its part to help Americans prepare.                
                

            
                You can’t say we didn’t see it coming.

'Celebrity Apprentice' vs. 'The Biggest Loser(s)': Washington edition,"Now Playing                            How did Trump change the game for future elections?                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                It’s happening right before our eyes. President Trump is busy changing the direction of America, while Democrats worry about the color of the curtains in the White House.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Remarkably, politics today is like a reality television show. President Trump is “Celebrity Apprentice.” The career Washington politicians are “the Biggest Losers.”                
                

            
                Like the ""Apprentice” Trump is new to Washington and the ways of government. But he’s a quick learner and one of the most brilliant businessmen in world history. At one point a quarter of a century ago, Trump was billions of dollars in debt to the biggest banks in the world. For all intents and purposes Trump was bankrupt and finished.                
                

            
                The arrogant bankers thought they had him right where they wanted him. But Trump defeated the banks -- and pulled a rabbit out of a hat. He came back from death’s door. Today he is worth an estimated $4 billion plus -- with almost no debt. Houdini couldn’t have pulled off a better trick.                
                

            
                “The Celebrity Apprentice” knows how to win a tough reality competition. The D.C. liberal politicians are making the same mistake -- writing Trump off prematurely. The difference this time is…                
                

            
                Bankers are a thousand times smarter than career Washington politicians.                
                

            
                The politicians in Washington are “the Biggest Losers.” They have no idea what they’re up against. They are so hysterical over President Trump that they’ve convinced themselves that they’re winning. Only days ago a leading Democrat said Trump is already a “lame duck president.”                
                

            
                I’ll bet the bankers thought that, too.                
                

            
                Meanwhile Trump is quietly going about destroying liberals and liberal policies. It’s happening every single day and the liberal politicians and biased-liberal mainstream media are too blind, deaf, and mostly dumb to notice.                
                

            
                In only the last week, while liberals sat around gloating over the “failure” of the ObamaCare repeal…Trump changed the direction of America. Trump is busy erasing Obama like he never existed.                
                

            
                And wait, ObamaCare’s repeal is coming too. What happened to TrumpCare was a short-term blip. Trump is relentless. I should know. I wrote the national bestseller “The Power of RELENTLESS.” Trump is the poster boy for relentless. More on that in a minute.                
                

            
                First let’s review what Trump has accomplished in only a week.                
                

            
                 -- Trump approved the Keystone Pipeline that Obama fought against for eight long years, then killed outright. Like Freddie Krueger in “Nightmare on Elm Street” Keystone is back from the dead.                
                

            
                 -- Trump rolled back Obama’s entire climate change agenda and killed the war on coal. Coal was dead, and now it’s not.                 
                

            
                Like I said, Trump is erasing Obama like he was never there.                
                

            
                 - Trump and AG Jeff Sessions announced the defunding of Sanctuary Cities. Finally, we have a president who believes in the rule of law. Finally, we have a president who believes in the U.S. Constitution. Finally, we have a president who takes action. Finally, we have a president who follows through on his campaign promises. Trump really will cut off funding to cities that protect illegal aliens and refuse to obey the laws of the land.                 
                

            
                It’s a new country, folks. Call it “Trumpland.”                
                

            
                -  Trump forced an Israel-hater at the United Nations who authored a report calling Israel an “apartheid state” to resign. Obama would have given her an award. Trump said ""YOU'RE FIRED.""                 
                

            
                 - Trump signed legislation killing BLM (Bureau of Land Management --  where all the liberal big government control freaks live) rules for federal government control of over 40 million acres of federal lands. Trump has the back of ranchers, farmers, property owners. The power is back in the hands of the states, not Gestapo-like agents of the federal government.                
                

            
                - Trump put his son-in-law Jared Kushner in charge of a SWAT team of business executives with the job of streamlining government, overhauling the federal bureaucracy and killing regulations that hinder business.                
                

            
                 - Trump signed two new Executive Orders on trade policy leveling the playing field for American workers. Trump just did something no other politician has ever done -- he did exactly what he promised on the campaign trail.                
                

            
                -  Don’t look now, but Trump is taking bids on the building of “THE WALL.” Liberals believed Trump's wall was just a slick campaign slogan. It’s really happening. Over 500 companies have signed up to make bids to build the infamous wall -- and over a dozen are Hispanic-owned.                
                

            
                -  And then Trump shocked the world by directing a missile attack on Syria's air bases after Syria used chemical weapons on their own people. Trump drew the line in the sand that Obama never did in eight years. Trump punished the bad guys and sent a powerful message to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. ""There is a new sheriff in town. Don't mess with America!""                
                

            
                -  Finally, my educated guess is Trump is also creating Executive Orders right now, behind the scenes, that slowly starve and strangle ObamaCare without any Congressional vote. Wanna bet?                 
                

            
                But in the end, it won't matter. Because I’m betting President Trump will convince Congress to pass the ObamaCare repeal…soon. Trump didn’t lose that battle. Liberals celebrated way too soon.                
                

            
                Businessmen like Trump never fail. They just learn from an initial failure, pick themselves back up and figure out how to win the battle.                
                

            
                Smart businessmen are relentless. They run circles around politicians.                
                

            
                Trump’s political opposition in Congress is made up of a bunch of clueless career politicians. They have no balls. They've never risked a dime of their own money. They play only with OPM (other people's money). They have no idea how to play a game of ""chicken"" against Trump, a man who has risked billions of his own money. Trump will eat them for breakfast.                
                

            
                ObamaCare is as good as dead. Liberals just don’t know it yet.                
                

            
                And Trump will be one step closer to erasing Obama's legacy like he never existed.                
                

            
                With President Trump in charge, politics is like the greatest show on earth. It’s like a battle of  ""Celebrity Apprentice” vs. “the Biggest Losers.”

              No one wants to repeal ObamaCare more than I do.  As a career physician, there are few in Congress who have as much firsthand experience on all sides of the health care debate as I do.  I’ve voted for repeal.  I’ve sponsored my own Repeal and Replace plans.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But I’ve also led the fight to stop and block “ObamaCare Lite” plans offered in both houses of Congress this year.  These have been plans that have spent nearly as much money as ObamaCare, that left most of the taxes and regulations in place, and basically failed to honor our promise of repeal.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Unfortunately, they’re back again, and I must add to the list of ObamaCare Lite plans to oppose the new Graham/Cassidy bill that was introduced last week in the Senate.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              In all ways, this bill is also ObamaCare Lite.  In no way is it repeal the way we promised.  I will oppose this bill as I did the other fake repeal bills, and I urge those who want repeal to do so, as well.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Make no mistake – Graham/Cassidy keeps ObamaCare funding and regulations in place.  Oh, it rearranges the furniture a bit, changes some names, and otherwise masks what is really going on – a redistribution of ObamaCare taxes and a new Republican entitlement program, funded nearly as extravagantly as ObamaCare.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Their sales pitch is, “If you like your ObamaCare, you can keep it.”  That’s nice, but I don’t like it, I don’t want to keep it, and I don’t want to keep paying for it.  
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              Graham/Cassidy doesn’t repeal a single ObamaCare insurance regulation.  All of the Title 1 rules, the Essential Health Benefit rules, all of them - they’re still in place here.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              States may grovel on bended knee for some relief to the federal government, with no guarantee of success and no permanent solution beyond the current administration.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I believe the president and HHS Secretary would WANT to do the right thing on state waivers, but I’ve already spent the better part of the year arguing with an army of bureaucrats and lawyers in the administration trying to get them to do something President Trump and I AGREE should be done - loosening up the rules on joining group plans.  This would be a huge change for Americans and a big fix for our system – yet they can’t get it done.  The idea disappears into the Swamp.  I’m afraid even the minor waivers of regulations envisioned here would do the same.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This bill is also set to spend us further into debt.  Even the bill’s authors and proponents, using what I’m sure are rosy numbers, admit that their ObamaCare Lite bill will spend 90 percent of what we currently spend on ObamaCare.  Other estimates are closer to 95 percent.  Either way, did anyone go out to vote so we could repeal only 5 or 10 percent of ObamaCare?  I didn’t.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Graham/Cassidy won’t fix our health care problems, and it will become a permanent drain on the treasury - one that is already $20 trillion in debt, with a $700 billion deficit next year.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Repeal of ObamaCare, if we did it “root and branch” as some suggested in their campaigns, would have saved over a trillion dollars in spending over 10 years.  Instead, we are left trying to save crumbs while leaving the system largely intact.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I won’t do it.  I know many of my colleagues are getting desperate to say they “did something,” and I can sympathize with that.  They figure most people aren’t paying attention, and the press conference where they said they did something would carry them through the elections next year.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But I’m worried.  I’m worried about what happens when premiums continue to go up double digits (and they will).  I’m worried about what happens when the system continues its downward spiral, but this time it is “GOP/TrumpCare” that gets blamed.  And they will.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I’m looking ahead past the next election, to the day of reckoning when the bills are due, and we are out of money, because we did the wrong thing for the wrong reasons.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Graham/Cassidy keeps a trillion dollars in taxes and spending and redistributes it.  And, somehow, people are looking to call this “federalism.”  I wish it were, but that’s just not the case.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Their sales pitch is, “If you like your ObamaCare, you can keep it.”  That’s nice, but I don’t like it, I don’t want to keep it, and I don’t want to keep paying for it.  So how about we all keep our word and get rid of it?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To my colleagues, I say, “No thanks.”  This bill is no better than the last attempt and should receive no more support.  It should not pass.  I’ll vote no, and I’ll fight to stop the newest ObamaCare Lite plan.

                The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                How can President Trump and the GOP Congress escape the political damage from their failed pledge to produce a better healthcare plan than ObamaCare — one that covers more people, offers more choice and is cheaper?                
                

            
                If Congress can’t pass the current flawed Republican plan, Trump told leading conservative groups last week, he has a Plan B. It is to keep badmouthing the Affordable Care Act as a “disaster” and then blame Democrats when ObamaCare collapses.                
                

            
                He is going to need a Plan C because there is a big problem with Plan B.                
                

            
                If the Affordable Care Act ever fails, it will be because of Republicans.                
                

            
                It was Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who drained money from “risk corridors” created to protect insurance companies from losing money.                 
                

            
                And Republicans in 19 states refused to expand Medicaid, keeping about 4 million eligible Americans away from health insurance offered by ObamaCare.                
                

            
                It was Trump who cancelled advertising aimed at bringing more people into the program. Congressional Republicans also made a point of scaring away sports teams and celebrities ready to join in public service campaigns to tell people about the benefits of getting health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).                
                

            
                Who can forget all the scary claims coming from Congressional Republicans and candidate Trump about skyrocketing premiums under ObamaCare? They sounded the alarm without saying that most people in ObamaCare had nothing to fear because of federal subsidies. They also did not mention that premiums would have been higher without ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Despite the Republican effort, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected enrollment in ObamaCare would jump from 10 million in 2017 to 13 million in the next ten years.                 
                

            
                Actual enrollment for ObamaCare 2017, despite the non-stop GOP chorus predicting its death, came in at 9.2 million, about 500,000 less than in 2016. “Open enrollment was a success, and it would have been even higher without the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress enrollment,” Leslie Dach, director of the Protect Our Care Coalition, told CNBC in February.

"Marc Siegel, MD: Beyond ObamaCare -- My hopes for patients and real, affordable care","Now Playing                            Siegel: Here's where Sen. Paul is on wrong health care bill                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                House Republicans introduced two bills this week to repeal and replace ObamaCare. They include tax credits to replace subsidies, phasing out the Medicaid expansion, grants to the states and more state control, increasing the scope of health savings accounts and, happily, the end of the dysfunctional individual and employer mandates. More choice, less federal regulation.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Meanwhile, with no visible changes yet in offices like mine, patients continue to come for care and we doctors continue to provide it.                 
                

            
                We hope for a less insurance-heavy future because we know your coverage provides a promise we often can’t fulfill. That’s the key: Health insurance is not health care, just as auto insurance is not an automatic ticket to car repair.                
                

            
                Politicians for decades have blurred this distinction and used it to justify expanding the insurance market without necessarily caring for more people in a better way. Remember, this is the same federal government that lamely delivers our mail while Fedex and UPS run circles around it.                
                

            
                Practicing doctors know the truth: Health insurance doesn’t or can’t distinguish between problems (chest pain, fever, blackout) that require an office visit and those (colds, sprains, fatigue) that don’t.                 
                

            
                This is a main reason that health care costs escalate out of control: Necessary coverage for a pre-existing condition such as diabetes or even cancer covers not only insulin and chemotherapy, but a muscle spasm or sniffle that the same patient doesn’t need to see me for.                
                

            
                Fear of illness and death drive the market, and patients try to get as much coverage as they can to protect themselves against an overblown sense of risk. Politicians have fanned the flames of this fear to justify regulations and mandates, while insurers use it to justify rising premiums.                
                

            
                ObamaCare didn’t cause this problem, but it has made it worse, joining Medicare as a driver of the insurance market. The Affordable Care Act has added regulations and higher deductibles that have affected employer health coverage (for 175 million people) as well as the individual market (around 30 million) it was intended for. One of my patients fainted and was rushed to the hospital last month (luckily, he was OK), only to be hit with a $1,000 deductible that wasn’t in his company’s policy before this year.                
                

            
                Doctors everywhere will be glad to see the individual and employer mandates go. They are unethical and based on a false premise. Health care may be a right, but health insurance doesn’t guarantee it, since we doctors aren’t compelled to see every insured patient who comes our way and provide every service.                
                

            
                Surgeons, for example, are much slower to operate on patients with multiple medical problems for fear of complications. ObamaCare’s architects argued that screening tests like colonoscopies and mammograms and sexually transmitted disease labs lead to early diagnoses and treatments that save on health care costs. But even if this is true, it is more cost-effective for the government to provide these services directly, or to reimburse insurance companies to provide them, than it is to pile them into an essential benefits package under ObamaCare that everyone pays for in their premiums.                
                

            
                 Young, healthy people need emergency health coverage, not high-premium, high-deductible policies. Since 5 percent of the population uses 50 percent of our health services, the individual mandate is on a path toward socialized medicine.                
                

            
                For the worried well, with narrow networks of doctors (a Blue Cross study in 2016 revealed that more than half the state exchanges feed narrow networks) and rising deductibles (the average Bronze plan’s deductible rose over $12,000 last year) blocking usual use (a patient is often afraid to see me at all until her deductible is met, and then she comes in all the time, unnecessarily, once it is), the current doctor’s office is a dysfunctional place of pleas for pre-approvals and reimbursements, nights spent bleary-eyed over computer documentation and too-short decision-making discussions with patients.                
                

            
                No matter what the new health care bill ultimately looks like, it must include catastrophic options that were absent from the ACA. Since federal law prohibits emergency rooms from turning patients away, a baseline catastrophic coverage makes sense. Beyond this, public health is a reasonable justification for providing vaccines free of charge, as well as treatments in an epidemic or disaster.                
                

            
                But basic day-to-day control of health care decisions can be returned to the doctor’s office, where free-market solutions are better suited to innovative biotech personalized treatments of the present and especially the future.                
                

            
                In a TrumpCare future, patients will offer their credit card instead of their insurance card, and they’ll be met with a smile. It will be at least three times cheaper for the government to subsidize those with pre-existing conditions in high-risk state pools rather than the current subsidies for two thirds of people signing up at the state exchanges. National exchanges will introduce more competition and drive down prices. Catastrophic policies paid for at least partly by tax credits (between $2,000 and $4,000 per year per individual earning up to $75,000 in the current House bill), coupled with health savings accounts, will improve price transparency and enable us to guide our patients to more cost-effective choices. Instead of a prohibitive red light turning to green once the deductible has been met, there will be a frugal yellow light on the road to all my patients’ decisions.

                In December last year, The People’s Republic of Vermont, the only state that sends a self-described socialist to the U.S. Senate, rejected a proposal from Democrats for a single payer health care system, because it was just too expensive.

                They had ignored a basic economic principle: socialism doesn’t work because, to paraphrase Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s “Iron Lady,” you always run out of other people’s money.

                Donald Trump apparently missed that class at business school.                
                

            
                Sunday on “60 Minutes,” he made it clear that he supports the government takeover of health care and wants to give free care to every American.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Donald Trump is not a conservative. If he has a political philosophy at all, it is plutocratic hypocrisy. He inherited a fortune, used American capitalism to turn that into mega-wealth and now lectures everyone else that we need the government to take care of us.
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                He announced he will “…take care of everybody…” promising that “…the government’s gonna pay for it.”                
                

            
                Putting aside the implications of ""TrumpCare"" for our taxes, economic growth and the national debt, the implications for conservatism are deadly.                
                

            
                The Republican presidential primary is being dominated by someone who agrees with Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton about the defining domestic policy issue of our time.                
                

            
                The problem is this: Donald Trump is not a conservative. If he has a political philosophy at all, it is plutocratic hypocrisy. He inherited a fortune, used American capitalism to turn that into mega-wealth and now lectures everyone else that we need the government to take care of us.                
                

            
                The danger is, if he persuades Americans that government controlled health care is acceptable, he will have opened the door for a nanny state and made the Republican Party irrelevant.                
                

            
                It would hand the Left a rationale for interference in every aspect of our lives. If government pays for your health care, they will claim it should have a say in your lifestyle: whether you smoke or drink, your salt and sugar intake, how you exercise and even whether you own a firearm. It would be former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s big gulp campaign -- supersized.                
                

            
                Since our country’s founding, the bulwark against socialism’s empty promises and this kind of state control, has been the good sense of the American people and the steel spines of conservatives.                
                

            
                Yet almost eight years of the Obama presidency and the passage of ObamaCare has put that defense in jeopardy. Not because Democrats are suddenly winning the argument, but because Republicans have stopped fighting.                
                

            
                The Washington establishment is telling us that we must accept a ‘post-ObamaCare reality,' that the government should ensure coverage for every American.                
                

            
                Now the establishment is enabling Donald Trump with their silence and making him think his position is acceptable.                
                

            
                Even conservative senators like Ted Cruz are complicit. He has distinguished himself by praising Trump’s positions and clinging to his events, in the hope of picking up his votes when he eventually fades.                
                

            
                He and others are putting short term political expedience above principle.                
                

            
                Perhaps this explains why I am the only presidential candidate to have published an alternative to ObamaCare. The reason no one else has done it is because they have no intention of actually repealing and replacing the law.                
                

            
                But if they won’t do it, I will.                
                

            
                My plan removes the individual and employer mandates, lowers costs through price transparency for consumers and allows providers to compete in open markets.                
                

            
                It rescinds every single word of ObamaCare and replaces it with a free-market alternative.                
                

            
                It represents a return to the principles of liberty and self-reliance for which conservatism has long stood.                
                

            
                Health care policy on the Right determines whether we will simply be cheaper Democrats, offering a cost-effective version of their world view, or whether we represent a truly alternative vision for the future.                
                

            
                If we capitulate on this issue, we lose our rationale as a political force. This is conservatism’s last redoubt. Health care is our Alamo.                
                

            
                It will either be the gateway through which the forces of corruption and socialism ride, or it will become emblematic of the conservative revolution which takes back our country.                
                

            
                Texans like to tell the tale of Colonel Travis drawing a line in the sand before the battle. He asked his men to choose to defend something worth fighting for, or flee.                
                

            
                Today, I’m offering Republicans the same choice. The good senator from the great state of Texas can be conservatism’s modern day Moses Rose and quietly sneak out the back door, or he can denounce Donald Trump and stand with conservatives.                
                

            
                In turn, conservative voters have a responsibility to declare that anyone who supports single payer health care has no place in our movement.                
                

            
                Make no mistake, this is no side issue.                
                

            
                The road to liberalism’s false utopia is built on territory ceded by conservatives. To halt its advance, we must embrace our own principles and nominate a candidate who is intellectually and morally capable of standing their ground.                
                

            
                It is time for Republicans to pick a side of the line. It is time for conservatives to say that the circus is over. It is time to Dump Trump.
