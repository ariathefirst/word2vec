"Distinguished persons of the week: Have you no sense of decency, sir?","Amidst the scandals, the abjectly stupid cheering for a trade war, the putrid management that has resulted in personnel churn in the White House and the nonstop lying, President Trump, we might forget, is a lousy human being. Cruel, petty, boastful and disloyal — not to mention cowardly — he embodies none of the characteristics we would associate with heroism. Simply put, he is the opposite of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who even his political critics concede is an America hero — brave, loyal, self-effacing and intolerant of bullies. As he battles brain cancer, McCain once again shows courage, evidencing not a drop of self-pity. It was therefore entirely appropriate that it was McCain’s wife and daughter who skewered Trump this past week. They firmly and effectively eviscerated Trump for his mean-spirited reference to McCain at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference gathering. Trump had bemoaned the GOP’s defeat on health care, mocking the thumbs-down sign John McCain gave in opposing a Trumpcare bill. The crowd booed. Appearing on “The View,” Meghan McCain called out Trump, saying Trump’s stunt was “incredibly hurtful especially after I’ve had this conversation with him on the phone to have this moment of booing at CPAC, which is supposed to be the mothership of conservatism and the Republican Party, and to sort of see booing at this specific moment in time is incredibly hurtful.” Cindy McCain added, “More importantly, for my own feeling, we need more compassion. She continued, “We need more empathy. We need more togetherness … we don’t need more bullying, and I’m tired of it.” So are we all, Mrs. McCain. The McCain women remind us that we should not allow the public displays of meanness to go unaddressed, just as we should not countenance Trump’s lying. If we are to retain our decency as a people and instill in children disdain for bullies and compassion for those they target, we must rebuke the bullies. Is this a small matter? Perhaps. Trump’s conduct in this regard has no constitutional or policy relevance. However, Trump’s derision of an American hero battling cancer was one more sign of declining civility in our society, which already was fraying before Trump’s arrival. One of the many failings of elected Republicans is their failure to hold Trump accountable for debasing the office of the presidency and our public debate. In failing to address his conduct as well as his constitutional and policy affronts, they make themselves look weak and classless. So for standing up for not only their dad/husband but also for kindness and decency, we can say, well done Meghan and Cindy.

"The Health 202: New HHS head faces pressure from Republicans, too","THE PROGNOSIS A scathing letter from a member of his own party awaited Alex Azar as he became Health and Human Services secretary this week, one of many piled-up tasks he faces at an agency that has lacked a leader for the past four months. Since October, HHS has fallen sadly short of its duties to comply with document and information requests from Congress, House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) wrote to Azar. HHS has shown a pattern of “nonresponsiveness and wanton disregard” for the committee’s responsibility to oversee the executive branch, according to Gowdy’s letter, dated Jan. 29. “Despite the committee’s effort to accommodate HHS’ legitimate interests, the department has missed mutually-agreed deadlines, produced meager and incomplete sets of information (much of which is available publicly) and taken a posture of nonchalance with respect to the committee’s requests,” wrote Gowdy, who announced this week he won't seek reelection. House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) says he will not seek reelection. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) In fact, HHS has gotten so bad at responding to requests from Gowdy's committee that it seems like its legislative affairs department “has fallen into a state of permanent disrepair,” Gowdy wrote, listing six specific examples of information his committee requested from the department to which he didn't receive a full response. The charges are just one indication of the massive job that awaits Azar at HHS, a sprawling agency at the center of some of the most pressing and controversial issues of the day. It’ll be his job to guide the agency through all sorts of new waters, from Medicaid waivers giving states new latitude, to revisions to Medicare payment changes, to Obamacare rule changes – just to name a few. The good news for Azar is that his reception inside his new department has been decidedly positive, both within HHS and from outside observers. The warm welcome is a sharp contrast from to the feelings surrounding the new secretary's predecessor, former congressman Tom Price (R-Ga.), who resigned in disgrace last fall over his use of private jets. “I like Tom, but politicians sometimes are not the ideal people to be running big departments,” Tom Miller, a health-care fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told me, adding that Azar is a “smart lawyer” who doesn’t do things that “blow up” in his face. Unlike Price, Azar already has several years at HHS under his belt, where he worked before moving to major drug manufacturer Eli Lilly. He also has a law degree and is described by former colleagues as someone who is less political and more pragmatic in his approach. On Tuesday, Azar held an agencywide staff meeting that was webcast. There’s talk that he is trying to connect with top health-care lawmakers on Capitol Hill; staff for Sen. Patty Murray (Wash.), who serves as the ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, confirmed Azar has been in touch to set up a meeting with the senator. Reporters also have some hope that media relations with HHS might improve in the Azar era. Although most reporters will tell you the Obama administration was hardly perfect when it came to communicating with the press, things got even worse under Price and after his departure. HHS regularly invites only media it perceives as friendly to phone calls with agency officials; two recent examples were when the agency announced a new religious freedom division and when it issued guidance laying out how states could impose new work requirements on Medicaid recipients. Azar has only been secretary for five days, so it’s still not clear how he’ll reshape HHS. But even some Democrats – six of whom voted to confirm him in the Senate – believe he will have a positive impact. “I think he’s incredibly competent,” Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) recently told Politico. “I don’t share a lot of his philosophy, but I think he understands — as someone who has been at the administration — the importance of the rule of law and compliance.” Acting CDC Director Anne Schuchat. (AP Photo/Molly Riley) AHH: Many CDC employees are overjoyed their acting director is back in charge, after the resignation Wednesday of Brenda Fitzgerald stemming from conflicts over her financial interests (including revelations that Fitzgerald bought shares in a tobacco company after she took the helm), The Post's Lena H. Sun reports. When they got the notice the principal deputy director, Anne Schuchat, who has nearly three decades of CDC experience, would be taking over (again) as acting director, employees were happy to hear the news. “Yes! There is palpable relief that she’s back in charge,” said one analyst. “You’d have joyous celebration if they made her permanent director.” Early Thursday, Schuchat sent a “Dear Colleagues” email to staff thanking them for their work. “It is an honor to provide leadership for our nation’s premier public health agency, and all of you, in this role. Please know that I take this responsibility very seriously and care tremendously about our continued excellence and strength,” she wrote. By Thursday afternoon, 40 comments had been posted anonymously on the CDC internal announcement board applauding her return and suggesting that her HHS bosses should just make her the permanent director. (The only other announcement with more comments asked employees whether they work while sick.) “HHS needs to make the obvious and easy decision to appoint Dr. Schuchat as CDC’s director permanently,” one person wrote. “Dr. Schuchat — thank goodness you’re back. You’re amazing, thank you. I echo — Dr. Schuchat for director,” added another poster. Funding Congress appropriated back in 2014, prompted by the Ebola epidemic, is running out. (Photo by Michel du Cille/The Washington Post) OOF: The CDC is dramatically cutting back its epidemic prevention activities in 39 out of 49 countries because money is running out, government officials said yesterday. Four years ago, in response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Congress approved a one-time, five-year emergency package to train frontline workers and strengthen laboratory and emergency-response systems. But in September 2019, CDC will run out of the $600 million it was awarded, and the Trump administration has not budgeted additional resources, Lena reports. “Two weeks ago, the CDC began notifying staffers and officials abroad about its plan to downsize these activities, because officials assume there will be no new resources,” a senior government official told Lena. The official said notice is being given to CDC country directors as the very first phase of a transition"
What Trump's economic handiwork will bring in 2018,"Depending on your perspective, the high-fiving and back-slapping at the White House celebrating passage of the Republicans’ tax bill will either be run in GOP celebratory ads next year or used to shame GOP lawmakers who ran up the deficit mostly to benefit wealthy people (especially those among them who invest in real estate) and corporations. Former vice president Joe Biden’s chief economist thinks “there’s something hopeful going on, and that is this: the people are onto them. People know that you don’t really help them by giving corporations big tax breaks. They know the Republicans are doing their donors’ bidding, not their constituents’. They see through the Republicans’ ridiculously cynical pivot to once again worrying about the deficit, but only as a rationale to cut programs people value.” In any case, Trump surely owns it all — the stock market he brags about, the economy he inherited and has tipped further toward the wealthiest Americans, the movement of jobs overseas (which critics say his plan will promote) and Trumpcare (Obamacare was “repealed,” he bragged, in extolling the repeal of the individual mandate). A stock market dip, a return to middling growth, yawning wealth disparity, more jobs shipped overseas or accelerated collapse of the Obamacare exchanges all will be blamed on him. It won’t be the media or the Democrats or recalcitrant GOP moderates (of which there appear to be none) who will be tagged for economic or health-care ills. Ironically, or tragically, Trump and the GOP played the game they decried — ignoring the day-to-day concerns of the “forgotten man and woman,” while lining the pockets of well-connected corporations and pass-through real estate moguls. Like mortgage derivative brokers before the 2008 crash, they are giddy with new riches. They confuse the health of Wall Street with the health of Main Street and fail to see how the financial edifice they constructed could come tumbling down. Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute warns: National debt becomes a more serious problem for the U.S. with each passing year, and is primarily driven by spending on middle-class entitlement programs and interest payments on the debt itself. By adding over $1 trillion in new debt to the $11 trillion already projected to be added over the coming decade, the Republican tax law (whatever its merits, some of which are quite strong) makes this problem worse. So Republicans have not really changed the fortunes of the white working class in dying Rust Belt towns and languishing rural America — although they’ve limited opportunities for future generations. In the myth of the “average” worker, they’ve negated the real suffering of those at the bottom by balancing off gains at the top. This is precisely what fuels the populist revolt against a “rigged” system in which the rich get richer. The Trump GOP in fact rigged the system to the detriment of those who thrilled to its populist propaganda. Republicans made insurance in the individual market more expensive, gave billions back to corporations with no guarantee of better or higher-paying jobs (especially in the country’s interior), forgot about an infrastructure bill and set up new tax dodges for the Trump clan and their Mar-a-Lago partying guests. They have not addressed the mismatch between open jobs and available skilled workers, instead pacifying the base with the notion that rounding up and expelling illegal immigrants will somehow allow them to get well-paying manufacturing jobs. (Don’t try to figure it out; it’s hocus-pocus cooked up by those who cling to the “lump of labor” fallacy.) Meanwhile, the administration has done little to fund anti-addiction programs and, by doubling the standard deduction, has made charitable giving a lot less attractive for Americans. Republicans roll their eyes at the notion that 13 million fewer people will have insurance coverage. So, when the dust settles, will there be more suffering or less after the impact of Trump’s policies are felt? Will the Ohio Rust Belt towns come back, or will they shrivel as their inhabitants literally die off? What would a humane, sound approach have been to addressing the real needs of working-class Americans? Strain has a few ideas: Low rates of work-force participation and sluggish wage growth are also important challenges to confront. Guided by their belief that public policy ought to build ladders of opportunity, conservatives should push to expand earnings subsidies to help pull people into the work force. Relocation assistance targeted on individuals who want to work, have been out of work for some time, and lack the resources to move to a city with a better labor market would also offer them neither a handout nor a cold shoulder, but a hand up. Expanding apprenticeship programs would build skills and raise wages, but would allow the market to determine what skills are taught rather than rely on the judgment of bureaucrats. State and local governments should take steps to reduce commute times, which have become a barrier to employment in many sprawling cities. Zoning regulation in many cities often makes it harder for workers to afford to live near good jobs. And increasingly over the past few decades, occupational licenses have been issued not to protect the health and safety of consumers but rather to protect established businesses. This is a prime target for deregulation. But guess what? There’s less money after the mammoth tax giveaway available to do all that, and GOP hostility toward government (except when rearranging the tax code) makes it generally unwilling to pursue any of these approaches. By limiting state and local tax deductibility, Republicans have made it that much harder for localities to experiment and invest in these sorts of policies. Moreover, in its xenophobic trance, the GOP envisions cutting the number of legal immigrants, thereby depriving the United States of workers needed to pay for entitlements and new sources of entrepreneurship. That won’t help bring thriving industries to the Midwest, no matter how many fear-mongering speeches Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions give. If a rising tide raised all boats, Trump wouldn’t have been elected. Now that he has been and seeks to widen the gap between rich and poor, he’s betting that voters, just like his Trump University customers, can be conned. Somehow I don’t think that’s likely. The 2018 midterms will be enlightening.

Franken's troubles complicate liberal push against tax bill,"The accusations of sexual harassment against Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) have led to an official ethics investigation, to colleagues returning his generous campaign donations, and to calls for his resignation from once-supportive progressives. And it has all happened at the start of a tax-cut fight that Franken was supposed to help lead. The Democrats’ multilevel campaign to stop Republican-backed tax cuts, which has included ad buys, news conferences and activist pressure, was dealt a blow by Franken essentially being forced to take the bench. The senator had taken an increased, unique role in Democratic messaging this year, with a best-selling memoir, frequent use of social media and a new openness to national interviews. “You have to be able to hit back hard, quickly and in a way that works, and he’s uniquely skilled at doing that,” said one Senate Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid. The aide conceded that Franken’s diminishment was a setback but suggested that “there are other senators who are doing their jobs who are just as good at this.” But the aide did not say who. Franken, whose fame as a comedian predated his service in the Senate, capitalized on his name recognition this year to become one of the party’s most effective fundraisers. When he signed a Democratic fundraising email, Franken’s name produced more donations than anyone else in the 48-member Senate caucus, said Democrats with knowledge of their party’s fundraising efforts. On Thursday afternoon, Democratic Sens. Jon Tester (Mont.) and Tammy Baldwin (Wis.) announced that they would give money from Franken’s political action committee to charity. Franken had also been delivering for Democrats with viral videos, teaming up with celebrities (David Letterman) or colleagues (Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren). Last week, a five-minute video Franken and Warren recorded to argue that Republican tax cuts would not lead to chief executives hiring more U.S. workers was viewed more than a million times on Facebook. [Leading Senate Democrats call for ethics investigation into Al Franken] On Thursday, Warren said in a statement that Franken’s behavior in 2006 — broadcaster and model Leeann Tweeden said he “forcibly kissed” and groped her during a USO tour — had been “unacceptable and deeply disappointing,” and agreed with his decision to face an ethics investigation. Franken’s videos stood out, in part, because the coalition of progressives working to defeat the GOP tax-cut legislation has struggled to recover the energy from the fight to save the Affordable Care Act. The town hall meetings of spring and summer have generally petered out; just four Republican members of the House and one senator have scheduled town halls over next week’s pre-Thanksgiving recess. The #NotOnePenny coalition has kept up the pressure anyway, with a small Wednesday rally near the Capitol and in-state lobbying planned for the coming week. The addition of partial ACA repeal to the Senate’s version of the tax bill had helped galvanize activists, they said. “We’re going to find senators and members of Congress who voted for this legislation, and we’re going to hold them accountable — office visits, protests, rallies,” said Tim Hogan, a spokesman for Tax March, a progressive group organizing against the Republican legislation. “The more people talk about the contents of these bills, the harder it gets for Republicans to sell it and to hide from the consequences of their actions.” Franken had been trying to help with that pitch. “Republicans are trying to pass a terrible tax bill that would increase the deficit and cripple the Affordable Care Act,” he said in his final Facebook video before the scandal broke. “It was millions of Americans, including many of you, that made their voices heard and helped kill Trumpcare.” But by the end of Thursday, even some members of the coalition were holding Franken at arm’s length. MoveOn released a statement criticizing him; the group’s Washington director, Ben Wikler, formerly worked for Franken. Justice Democrats, a progressive group that backs primary challengers to incumbent Democrats, called on Franken to resign and be replaced by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.). “We believe Leeann Tweeden’s account and are disappointed in Senator Franken’s actions,” the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a group that had teamed up with Franken before, said in a statement. “Sexual harassment and assault are not joking matters. This behavior isn’t excusable in any context, and we’re glad he’s attempting to take responsibility and show remorse. We hope he commits himself to being part of a necessary culture shift in the halls of Congress, the entertainment industry, and across society.” Ed O’Keefe contributed reporting. "
A deep dive into American families,"The Deseret News and the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University are out with results of a survey on the American family. With 3,000 respondents, the survey provides a wealth of information on everything from cellphone use to drug addiction to political behavior. We’ll look at a few of the findings that have particular insight into hot-button public policy issues and political voting patterns. Views on health care confirm that Republicans have been out of tune with ordinary Americans: Consistent with other surveys, many elements of the Republican plan proved highly unpopular, regardless of income or family medical challenges  . . Few respondents to our survey wanted to give states control over the choice to cover pre-existing conditions, and even fewer wanted to cut federal funding for Medicaid. A little less than half of respondents wanted to eliminate the insurance mandate. The only exception to this unpopular slate of reforms is allowing for a greater variety of plans, though again, we did not offer respondents any detail about what that diversity of insurance offerings might look like. Though the differences tend to be modest, lower income respondents tend to be less supportive of the Republican plan than middle- or upper-income Americans. … Though very few [Hillary] Clinton voters or nonvoters wanted state control over insurance rules, nearly 45 percent of [Donald] Trump voters wanted to empower the states – still not a majority, but much greater support than we find among other respondents. Similarly, about one-third of Trump voters wanted to cut federal funding for Medicaid. This, too, is far short of a majority, but far more than the 4 percent of Clinton voters and 18 percent of nonvoters. Still, because these core elements of the plan did not garner majority support even among Trump supporters, these results may provide some insight as to why the House bill did not ultimately become law. Other elements of the plan were, however, highly popular among Trump voters, including ending the insurance mandate and providing a larger variety of plans. The idea of eliminating the mandate was extremely unpopular among Clinton voters, and nonvoters were evenly split. Finally, clear majorities of all different political perspectives supported the idea of greater diversity in insurance plan offerings. Republicans might want to consider, then, that paying for an already unpopular tax bill with Medicaid cuts would be a political loser. Political watchers have looked at economic conditions and racial views to explain voting patterns in 2016. But there is another critical element that gets less mention: Trump voters are simply less socially connected than are Clinton voters. On the survey we asked a series of questions about whether or not people turned to others for help with things like childcare, child rearing advice, relationship advice, help with finances, taking care of property or transportation. Though this data can be cut in several different ways, for those who reported only one such connection the probability of voting for Trump was higher than for those who reported three or more such connections. … Trump voters appear to be more or less like Clinton Voters in terms of spending Thanksgiving with their immediate families (the same was true of other options like friends or being alone), but they look much more like nonvoters when it comes to spending time with extended family. Neither group is as likely to get together with extended family as are the Democratic voters. The inescapable conclusion is that support for Trump is related to social connectedness. His voters have relatively fewer connections outside of their immediate families, fewer connections to the welfare state and even tend to look more like nonvoters with respect to Thanksgiving plans and extended families. This may explain why Trump voters cared less about policy results than the emotional feeling that Trump was going to understand and take care of the “forgotten man and woman.” When he makes constant references to cultural markers (e.g. Merry Christmas, loathing of liberal media), he is in effect reminding these otherwise disconnected voters that he’s “one of them.” Put differently, the extreme tribalism that characterizes Trump’s politics can be seen as a critical organizing factor for people looking for a sense of belonging. It’s beyond logic and reason, which explains why his core supporters (roughly a third of voters) are unmoved by political outcomes. Finally, it turns out that attitudes on immigration change considerably when the family element gets considered, but not for a whole lot of Trump voters. The pollsters asked “whether or not respondents favor or oppose ‘deporting unauthorized immigrants [even when it separates family members].’ However, we varied whether or not the respondent was shown the text in brackets. Essentially, this question tests how much people favor deportation of immigrants when they are reminded that it may break up families.” The results were mixed: The family reminder drops the percentage who favor the policy [of deportation] by about 18 percentage points and raises opposition by the same amount. Respondents clearly change their opinion when faced with the reminder of how immigration impacts families (at least potentially). …[However] the effects of the experiment are overwhelmed by the electoral choices of the respondents. Some Trump voters are moved by the plight of immigrant families, but by more than three out of four of them still favored deportation when shown the text about separating families. In contrast the number of Clinton voters who favor deportation drops from about three in ten to about one in ten when they see the text. Nonvoters are the most affected by the reminder. About half of them favor the policy when it is shown without context. Adding the text cuts that proportion in half. In short, “family values” to a large degree has faded for Trump voters. Trump’s raging nativism seems a greater motivator for these voters. Maybe Democrats should start embracing — and redefining — the notion of “family values.” There is plenty more for data junkies to pore over. What stands out here is that Trump’s emotional, nativist appeal has hit the sweet spot for his base, although that doesn’t guarantee support for specific policies (e.g. Trumpcare). For all the talk of “values voters” on the right, the main concerns in 2017 are not cultural. The study finds that “more people believe that the most serious problems facing marriages and families are economic, and fewer believe that the challenges are primarily cultural.” The survey reports: “Since 2015, there has been an 11 percentage point increase in the people who say the top problems facing families are economic and a 17-point decrease in the percentage of respondents choosing cultural issues. In particular, the costs of raising a family and high work demands on parents seem to be a greater consideration for more survey respondents in 2017 than they were in 2015.” That certainly seems to be an opening for Democrats to claim the mantle of the party of economic security, the party that reduces stress and strain on American families.

The Daily 202: Trump voters have buyer’s remorse in North Carolina focus group,"Supporters listen as Donald Trump speaks during a rally on the eve of the 2016 election in Raleigh, N.C. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Republican women who voted for President Trump in North Carolina said during a focus group Wednesday night that they are embarrassed by and exasperated with him. -- Annie Anthony, 56, voted for Trump last year because she opposes abortion and did not like how Hillary Clinton handled Benghazi. Now she fears that Trump is marching us toward war with North Korea. She describes the first 10 months of his presidency as “chaotic, stressful and an uphill battle.” “While I thought his ideas appealed to me, since he’s been in there he’s embarrassed me by his behavior,” said Anthony, a divorced college graduate who runs a local nonprofit volunteer center and drives for Uber to make ends meet. “He behaves so unpresidential. The words he uses. The tweeting. I mean, he dresses nice. And Melania is looking good. When he was away (in Asia), he was great at being a president. He’s the showman. But here at home, I can’t imagine how they let him build a country club — let alone be in one. Because adults don’t behave that way. I’ve been surprised that a billionaire would behave the way he has … “I don’t have a problem with him tweeting,” she continued. “I follow him because I want to see what he’s saying myself and not have someone interpret it for me. But I think that his language is unprofessional. He uses words like ‘sad’ and ‘bad.’ That’s first grade language. We’re an intelligent population who elected you. Represent us!” Anthony, a registered Republican, remains hopeful that Congress will soon pass tax cuts, but she’s nervous that they’ll take away the deduction for charitable donations. She’s also worried that, if her health insurance rates continue to go up, she won’t be able to afford to go see the doctor any more. (She makes less than $50,000 a year.) Looking ahead to the midterms, she offered an ominous warning for the GOP: “I think the swamp is still full. I might be voting to drain that swamp some more.” -- Veteran pollster Peter Hart organized the two-hour-and-15-minute session in Wilmington for Emory University. Five independents, four Republicans and three Democrats participated. The Washington Post was invited to observe. Coinciding with Trump’s 300th day in office, the wide-ranging conversation with a cross section of voters in a swing state illuminated why Trump’s job approval rating nationally is at 37 percent in Gallup’s daily tracking poll. In the history of polling, no president has ever had a 57 percent disapproval rating at this stage of his presidency. -- When Hart asked for one word or phrase to describe Trump, the group initially erupted in laughter. Only two of 12 said something positive (“bold” and “fights back”). The others called him incompetent, a baffling fool, childlike, a loose cannon, an immature narcissist and ignorant. Emily Bell, a 32-year-old occupational therapist who voted for Trump, described him as rude and stressful. “I feel like he told people that he had all these big ideas and big plans, and it just seems to kind of roll to something else. It’s like nothing is ever accomplished,” said Bell, who is married and has a postgraduate degree. “I’m going to stay optimistic, but I lean more toward being independent. Really it will come down (in 2020) to who I can trust more.” -- Melissa Hight, a 62-year-old married retiree who has a postgraduate degree and voted for Trump, used the word “antagonistic” to describe him. “I had high hopes, but he just goes about things in a way that gets everybody’s back up against the wall,” she lamented. “He doesn’t facilitate working together. He comes out with these grandiose ideas, and there’s no follow through. It’s a lot of talk. … He hasn’t acted presidential at all. The tweets bother me. They may be enlightening to some people. I’m not a tweeter. But to me, firing off these tweets is just childish. … He should be above that. … I will call a spade a spade because I’m a conservative more than a Republican.” -- Only one of the 12 participants emerged as an unapologetic defender of the president. Cynthia Layton, a 64-year-old nurse, said she loves Trump’s tweets. “I like him because he talks like my neighbor talks to me,” she explained. “I don’t need an elitist person talking down to me. The media does not give an honest opinion. That’s why I turned off cable 10 years ago. I read my sites. I listen to his tweets. … That’s how I hear from him. The media doesn’t tell you what’s going on, so you have to find out what’s going on on your own. … To me, I think his tweets are simply what he honestly feels because he uses white and black language and doesn’t give you all these flowery descriptions about everything. I appreciate that he’s direct and tells it like it is.” -- Hart is a Democrat, but he plays it very straight when he moderates these focus groups and never tries to tip the scales. The sessions he convened before the presidential election always wound up underscoring Hillary Clinton’s weaknesses, for instance. (Check out my write-up of Hart’s August 2016 focus group with swing voters in Milwaukee, which foreshadowed Clinton’s defeat in Wisconsin.) Donald Trump, then president-elect, visited Fayetteville, N.C., last December for a “thank you” rally. (Sara D. Davis/Getty Images) -- Trump carried North Carolina by four points last year. With 15 electoral votes, the Tar Heel State was a hotly contested battleground and will be again in 2020. Barack Obama won here in 2008, and Mitt Romney picked it off in 2012. The economy and health care were the issues that everyone cared about most. Seven of the 12 participants said they think Trump is doing a good job on the economy; 10 said he’s not doing a good job at addressing racial tensions. Asked to name their top concerns, no one mentioned Russian interference or the ongoing investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller. Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who got reelected last year, is leading one of the inquiries into Moscow’s meddling as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. -- Hart had a lightning round in which he asked everyone to say the first word that came to mind when they heard a politician’s name. All 12 used a negative word to describe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Two said spineless. Others said sleazy, insecure, incompetent and narcissistic. About half the group hadn’t heard about Roy Moore. Those who were familiar with the Alabama story called him troubled, a scumbag and disgusting. The sole exception was Layton, who called him a scapegoat. The room remained quite downbeat about Clinton. Participants described her as annoying, crooked, a thief, outmatched, troubled, despicable and a sore loser. Interestingly, Joe Biden received widespread praise as savvy, smart, nice and levelheaded. -- The focus group really underscored the extent to which the deep unease that propelled Trump’s victory a year ago has only gotten worse. Asked for one word to describe the state of America today, the answers were chaotic, tornado, backward, troubled, disrupted, fearful, anxious and embarrassing. Only Layton used a positive word: “Improving.” Hart prompted everyone to name the last president who they think united the country. For the most part, the Democrats said Obama and the Republicans said Reagan. Someone picked John F. Kennedy. No one named George W. Bush or Bill Clinton. Then he told everyone to imagine that they have a magic wand and could take a positive quality from a former president and transfer it over to Trump. What would it be? The answers included Reagan’s sense of humor, JFK’s grace under pressure, Abraham Lincoln’s ability to bring the country back together and Obama’s professionalism. -- The 2020 election is not for three years, which is an eternity in politics. There were some signs that Trump has not completely depleted the reservoir of goodwill among the folks who voted for him. Michael Leimone, 41, cooks pizzas at a chain restaurant and backed Trump last year. Asked to describe how the presidency has gone, he used the words “whirlwind” and “vacant.” “He’s not been there when you needed him to be there,” he said. “After Charlottesville and (the hurricanes), he was out doing other stuff.” Leimone — who is married, has kids at home and didn’t go to college — added later that he still thinks Trump is probably doing a better job than Clinton would have. “We kind of knew what we were getting with him,” he said. “He’s kind of a loose cannon — I don’t like that — but what we’ve had for years and years — not just Obama, but leading up to that — they weren’t getting the job done in terms of leading the country. So he’s still better than the alternative of a career politician.” He said he remains optimistic. “I expected a lot out of him … but nobody can do it all,” Leimone said. “He has a harder road because everyone hates him, not just the Democrats. He still has a lot of time to prove himself.” WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Gena Richardson, right, who was asked out by Roy Moore while working at Sears. Her classmate Kayla McLaughlin, left, worked at Sears too and remembers Moore coming in frequently. (Kayla McLaughlin) TWO NEW MOORE ACCUSERS: -- Two more women have described unwanted overtures by Roy Moore at an Alabama mall — where his behavior began making young employees so uncomfortable that some would “draw straws” to decide who would deal with him during his frequent visits. Stephanie McCrummen, Beth Reinhard and Alice Crites report: “Gena Richardson says Moore pursued her during her senior year of high school while she was working in the men’s department at Sears. “Richardson says Moore … asked her where she went to school, and then for her phone number, which she says she declined to give, telling him that her [father] would never approve. A few days later, she says, she was in trigonometry class at Gadsden High when she was summoned to the principal’s office over the intercom in her classroom. She had a phone call. “I said ‘Hello?’” Richardson recalls. “And the male on the other line said, ‘Gena, this is Roy Moore.’ I was like, ‘What?!’ He said, ‘What are you doing?’ I said, ‘I’m in trig class.’” Richardson says Moore asked her out again on the call. A few days later, after he asked her out at Sears, she relented and agreed, feeling both nervous and flattered . . . They met that night at a movie theater in the mall after she got off work, a date that ended with Moore driving her to her car in a dark parking lot behind Sears and giving her what she called an unwanted, ‘forceful’ kiss that left her scared.” -- Another Alabama woman, Tina Johnson, 28 at the time, says Roy Moore groped her in 1991 while she was visiting his law office with her mother. The encounter is also the first alleged to have occurred during Moore’s marriage. AL.com’s Anna Claire Vollers reports: “At one point during the meeting, she said, Moore came around the desk and sat on the front of it, just inches from her. He was so close, she said, she could smell his breath. According to Johnson, he asked questions about her young daughters, including what color eyes they had and if they were as pretty as she was. She said that made her feel uncomfortable, too. Once the papers were signed, [her] mother walked through the door first, she said, Moore came up behind her. It was at that point, she recalled, he grabbed her buttocks. ‘He didn't pinch it; he grabbed it,’ said Johnson. She was so surprised she didn't say anything. She didn't tell her mother. She said she told her sister years later how Moore had made her feel uncomfortable during that meeting. Her sister told AL.com she remembers the conversation.” -- BUT, Alabama Republicans are standing behind Moore. NBC News’s Alex Johnson and Vaughn Hillyard report: “The steering committee of the state Republican Party — the only entity with the power to remove Moore from the Dec. 12 special election ballot — took no action on Moore's nomination at a meeting Wednesday [night]. Two members of the committee said late Wednesday that the state party is continuing to support Moore[.]” -- Moore punched back: “If you are a liberal and hate Judge Moore, apparently he groped you,” a campaign spokesman said in a statement responding to the Post story. “If you are a conservative and love Judge Moore, you know these allegations are a political farce.” He also tweeted this: Dear Mitch McConnell,Bring. It. On. Which prompted replies like this, from a New Republic editor: Bring It On"" was a movie about high school cheerleaders"
This is exactly how to make a bad tax bill even worse,"Even before Senate Republicans introduced a plan to use the tax bill to repeal the individual mandate (thereby reducing the number of insured by 13 million), the GOP tax bill was on weak footing. A series of public polls shows that a large majority of Americans believe (correctly) it would benefit corporations and the rich more than ordinary Americans. The Kaiser Health Tracking Poll now finds: Overall, reforming the tax code is seen as a “top priority” for President Trump and Congress by about three in ten (28 percent), falling well-behind several health care issues such as reauthorizing funding for the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) (62 percent) and stabilizing the ACA marketplaces (48 percent). Among Republicans, about half (51 percent) say reforming the tax code is a “top priority” which is similar to the share who say the same about providing funding for places in the U.S. affected by hurricanes (52 percent), repealing the ACA (50 percent), reauthorizing CHIP (46 percent), stabilizing the ACA marketplaces (46 percent), and addressing the prescription painkiller epidemic (46 percent). There is high resistance to a number of GOP provisions. For example, “The majority of the public (68 percent) — including majorities of Democrats (77 percent), independents (66 percent), and Republicans (61 percent) — oppose eliminating the tax deduction for individuals who have high health care costs. One reason why the majority of the public may oppose eliminating the tax deduction for high medical expenses is because more than four in ten (44 percent) think eliminating this tax deduction would affect them and their families.” A Quinnipiac poll finds: “American voters disapprove 52 – 25 percent of the Republican tax plan. Republican voters approve 60 – 15 percent, with 26 percent undecided. All other party, gender, education, age and racial groups disapprove.” In addition, “The wealthy would mainly benefit from this tax plan, 61 percent of American voters say, while 24 percent say the middle class will mainly benefit and 6 percent say low-income people would mainly benefit. … Only 16 percent of American voters say the Republican tax plan will reduce their taxes, while 35 percent of voters say it will increase their taxes and 36 percent say it won’t have much impact on their taxes. Only 36 percent of voters believe the GOP tax plan will lead to an increase in jobs and economic growth, while 52 percent do not believe it.” It’s hard to recall another major legislative initiative that was a key campaign promise — other than Trumpcare — that was so poorly received. Republicans claim that huge corporate tax cuts (totaling $1 trillion) will trigger enormous growth and increase jobs. This is both analytically suspect and, as a practical matter, likely untrue. Analyses from a variety of independent think tanks and economists across the political spectrum agree that whatever small boost in growth occurs, that blip fades as the negative consequences of increased debt take hold. On the corporate tax cuts, there is fierce debate about what percentage of those cuts inure to the benefit of workers (higher wages, more jobs) and how much to shareholders. Moreover, on a practical level, the bill is simply not going to result in a rush of new jobs, not even with so-called repatriation of money from overseas under a special rate to induce domestic investment. Senior economic adviser Gary Cohn personally witnessed the unenthusiastic reaction of top corporate executives. CNBC reports: At a gathering of chief executives hosted yesterday by the Wall Street Journal, business leaders called into question one of Cohn’s top arguments for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. When one of the Journal’s editors asked the crowd if they planned to up their capital expenditure if the GOP’s tax plan went through, only a smattering raised their hands. “Why aren’t the other hands up?” Cohn asked. … The informal poll was not the only disappointment for Cohn on Tuesday. Another non-scientific poll conducted at the gathering found that more than half of the CEOs present didn’t believe that Congress would pass a major tax bill by the end of the year. Cohn should not have been surprised. “A National Bureau of Economic Research study published in 2014 found ‘little evidence that corporate tax cuts boost economic activity’ unless implemented in a recession. Far from being short on cash, corporations are sitting on record amounts.” Even with the widespread conviction that the bill helps primarily the rich and big corporations, the GOP might still have been able to push it through. Republicans have convinced themselves that even a bad and unpopular bill is better than no bill (or maybe their donors have insisted that even a bad and unpopular bill is better than no bill). The Tax Policy Center explains: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch has come up with his solution to his tax bill’s Byrd rule problem. To help prevent the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from losing revenue after 10 years, he’s proposing to make nearly all individual tax cuts expire after 2025. The expiring provisions would include the individual income tax rate reductions, the larger standard deduction and child tax credit, the 17.4 percent deduction of income from pass-through businesses, and the repeal of the individual alternative minimum tax. The proposed corporate tax rate cut from 35 percent to 20 percent would be permanent. Hatch would also add a provision to repeal the individual mandate to purchase insurance through the Affordable Care Act. That would satisfy President Trump’s demands and free up another $300 billion. Hatch would use that revenue to increase the child tax credit to $2,000 and further reduce income tax rates for middle-income taxpayers. These twists might be enough to sink the bill. Hard-line conservatives are now fixated once again on getting rid of the individual mandate, which would be an anathema to Democrats (even some red-state Senate Democrats inclined to vote for a tax bill) and would lose the support of moderate Republicans. A GOP Senate staffer not authorized to speak on the record says that with the individual mandate in there, “I don’t see how they get to 50 [votes].” Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), about a week after a Democratic blowout election in Virginia, tweeted, “The GOP just combined their attempts to undo the Affordable Care Act with their tax cuts for the rich at the expense of working people. This would drive up taxes AND premiums for the middle class, and kick millions off their health coverage.” Don’t count on the individual mandate repeal being part of the final bill. (The Post reports, “They could drop it just as quickly as they picked it up, a testament to how freewheeling the decision-making on policy fundamentals remains. Already, there are signs it could explode the fragile consensus that Republican leaders have been trying to assemble among their caucus.”) Its reintroduction, however, should highlight how far Republicans are from a viable bill that could pass both houses and survive the Byrd rule. One wonders when Republicans will decide that a mammoth tax bill is unworkable and revert to a simple, much smaller tax cut. That might be the only “win” they have a chance of claiming.

The Daily 202: Inside Scott Walker’s comeback strategy,"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) announced last week that he will run for a third term. (Matthew DeFour/Wisconsin State Journal/AP) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: GREEN BAY, Wis. — Scott Walker hit political rock bottom in September 2015, soon after his presidential campaign flamed out. It was depressing to be one of the first candidates to drop out of a crowded Republican field that eventually winnowed to Donald Trump. But the Wisconsin governor’s first foray onto the national stage also took a serious toll on his standing back home. Less than a year after getting reelected, his job approval rating had fallen to 37 percent. Most Republicans in the state hadn’t wanted him to run in the first place, and many felt like he cared more about Iowa’s problems than Wisconsin’s. After two years of mending fences, Walker has clawed his way back. His numbers have inched up each of the past four quarters, and his approval rating is now back in the mid-to-high 40s. Last week I joined the governor at three events over three days as he launched his campaign for a third term. During an interview at a tailgate party across the street from Lambeau Field before the Green Bay Packers played in “Monday Night Football,” Walker talked about how much extra work he created for himself by running for president. “I even had a sympathetic radio announcer ask me just tonight: how did you get reengaged? He said … he thought that I would never run for reelection again because I’d become a national figure and moved on,” Walker said. “You look at our numbers … and we didn’t go back up fast. We just systematically moved our way up — not through paid advertising … but through just reconnecting with the voters.” As the GOP primaries continued without him from New Hampshire to South Carolina and beyond, Walker convened the first of more than 100 “listening sessions” in all 72 of Wisconsin’s counties. His advance team would set up two whiteboards in the front of every room. The governor would spend the first 20 minutes asking attendees to say something positive about the state, which he’d write down. Then he’d spend the next hour asking how Wisconsin could be better, filling up the second whiteboard. He tried to talk as little as possible. The governor offered several concrete proposals in his budget around the themes that came up again and again, such as opioid abuse and broadband access, but he said the most important result of the sessions was conveying to Wisconsinites that he had not “moved on.” “I really felt like the listening sessions gave us a chance to reengage, for me to hear but also for the people of the state to see that, ‘This guy is committed and focused,’” Walker explained. Walker boasted about how little time he’s spent in Madison, which Democrats attack him for but he believes keeps him connected with his constituents. “Almost every week, I am out Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday,” he said. “Usually, Wednesday is the only day I’m in the capitol. I love traveling the state.” -- Walker ate a bratwurst in a supporter’s living room here as he reflected on the lessons of his presidential campaign and outlined his theory of the case for 2018. He lamented that he listened too much to the advice of D.C. consultants. His campaign got too hot, too fast and scaled up too quickly. He tried to appeal to every faction of the party and never picked a lane, which opened him up to criticism for flip-flopping. “The biggest thing I learned there was that you need to be yourself,” Walker told me. “Not only personally, but campaign-wise, we had a really good thing going here. Particularly during the recall, we ran against some of the best that our opponents could throw at us. … One of the challenges in the presidential was that it’s really easy to get caught up in people saying, ‘You’ve got to do this, and you’ve got to do that,’ instead of just being who we were and running the campaign that we would normally run here.” He noted that his 2018 team is stocked with staffers from Wisconsin who he trusts and have proven themselves on his previous campaigns, not outsiders. Earlier this year, Walker also finally finished paying off the debt that his presidential bid had saddled him with. -- This is Walker’s sixth race in nine years. After getting reelected Milwaukee County Executive in 2008, he won the governorship in 2010. Then he survived the 2012 recall election, faced a competitive reelection fight in 2014 and almost immediately kicked off his presidential bid with a big Iowa speech in January 2015. Now a year out from Election Day, on his 50th birthday, he’s back on the trail again. “I know what to expect,” he joked. The song that plays whenever he starts and finishes a campaign speech is “Centerfield,” which imagines a baseball player pleading with his coach to put him in the game. Walker both loves sports metaphors and being on the field. Distilling his rationale for seeking a third term, he said: “It’s not like winning a championship and then you keep coming back and showing off your ring and not getting ready for the next season. We’re ready for the next season! … Elections are about the future, not the past. We lay out a synopsis of the successes we’ve had, but we also then pivot and say, ‘But there’s more to be done’ and then ‘Here’s the five key areas we’re focusing in on.’” He argues that Wisconsin has “a reform dividend” now because of the battles early in his tenure, especially his victories against the public-sector employee unions and their contracts, which allows for increased spending on K-12 schools and other popular programs. “I am more optimistic about the future of this state than I’ve been at any point in my lifetime,” he said during his announcement speech at a manufacturing facility in Waukesha, a Milwaukee suburb. “But this is not going to be an easy campaign. … We’re going to have a tough election.” -- Walker accepts that he’s a polarizing figure and says that’s the price of governing as an uncompromising conservative in a purple state. Basically no one in Wisconsin doesn’t already have a strong view of him. Because he’s so well defined, he’s somewhat insulated from President Trump. But if Democrats turn out in massive numbers to register their objections with what’s happening in Washington, as they did in last week’s off-year elections, Walker could be in serious trouble. Since similar numbers of people love Walker as hate him, he’s got a high floor of support but also a relatively low ceiling. Former governor Tommy Thomson (R) won his third term in 1994 with 67 percent. Walker doesn’t even pretend to think that’s in the realm of possibility. “We didn’t just do stuff on the margins. We did fundamental, transformational things that will really make a difference. … Some people don’t like that,” Walker said. “I’ve always felt that you’re able to govern whether you win with 50 plus one, or you win with 55 percent of 60 percent. Legally, you get to govern no matter what.” President Trump hugs Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at the White House in July after announcing the first U.S. assembly plant for electronics giant Foxconn will be built in Wisconsin. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) -- Walker has thrown in his lot with Trump. He endorsed Ted Cruz ahead of Wisconsin’s May 2016 primary, but then he rallied vocally behind Trump during a prime time speech at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Asked to offer an appraisal of the president 10 months in, Walker said: “His actions speak louder than words. A lot of people get hung up on his words or his tweets. If you look at the actions from where I sit in Wisconsin, this is a solid administration with a good Cabinet.” At the start of the year, his entree was White House chief of staff Reince Priebus. Now Vice President Pence is his main link. “There’s no denying that having Reince in there made a tremendous difference, but I talk to Mike Pence sometimes once or twice a week depending on the issue,” Walker said. “Mike’s just incredible.” He said he also talks with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, another Wisconsinite, “probably about once every week or two.” Trump was the first Republican presidential nominee to carry the Badger State since Ronald Reagan in 1984, but it was close. He won by one percentage point, or about 27,000 votes. One underappreciated reason that the president won Wisconsin is because he got to ride the reverse coattails of Republican Sen. Ron Johnson’s reelection campaign. Johnson got about 100,000 more votes than Trump by outperforming him in 30 of 72 counties, an arc that stretches from the Milwaukee suburbs up toward Green Bay. Trump outperformed Johnson in smaller, rural counties in the northwest and southwestern parts of the state. Walker wants to meld those coalitions together, as he did during the recall. Walker knows it’s essential next year to turn out the GOP base and run up the score bigly in rural areas, where Trump remains popular. He told me that Trump’s coalition is “very similar” to his. “If you look at the counties and the areas he won, it’s almost a parallel footprint,” he said. “I’ve got to stay strong in those areas. I can’t be complacent.” He has capitalized on GOP majorities in the state legislature to advance his agenda in a way that Trump could only dream of. But he’s worried that every Republican on the ballot in the midterms will suffer if Congress doesn’t get its act together. “They absolutely have to get tax reform done by the end of the year, and then I think that gives them the leverage to take another crack at repeal and replace (of Obamacare) by the early part of 2018,” he said. “They kind of went in reverse order. In retrospect, they probably should have done infrastructure first because it would have been the easiest to be bipartisan. They probably could have got some Democratic support on tax reform. In the end, they’d get no support on anything that repeals Obamacare.” Walker notes that many people who disagree with him still see him as effective, in contrast to Washington. “We’ve actually done things, so when I make bold promises for the next term, I’ve got the benefit of people going, ‘Dang, he’ll do that. Because he’s done it before,’” he said. Mahlon Mitchell (D), president of the Wisconsin firefighters union, announces his candidacy for governor on Monday in Madison, Wis. (Scott Bauer/AP) -- Several Democrats who hope to benefit from Walker fatigue and Trump backlash are lining up to run against him. The head of the state firefighter’s union announced on Monday. He joins a field with no clear front-runner that includes the state schools superintendent, a Milwaukee businessman, a state representative from Eau Claire and a former state Democratic Party chairman. “A year ago, people were saying that Democrats didn’t have any candidates. Now they are saying we have too many,” said Melanie Conklin of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin. “We are very happy to have so many quality candidates in the race. It shows that Walker is vulnerable.” The Democratic primary is not until the middle of next August, so whoever emerges is likely to have depleted their resources and there is little time to pivot for the general election. Walker hopes to amass a huge war chest that allows him to carpet bomb his eventual opponent. This week he’s wrapping up a one-year rotation as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, which allowed him to cultivate major donors across the country. Another built-in advantage is that he’s a favorite of the billionaire Koch brothers. Walker is always feted at their seminars, and their network plans to invest heavily in the race. To be sure, because Walker remains organized labor’s biggest boogeyman, unions and national Democrats will also go big here. “Voters in Wisconsin are getting tired of the Scott Walker show,” said the Democratic Governors' Association’s Jared Leopold. “Scott Walker has shown that he’s more interested in Scott Walker’s next job than in Wisconsinites’ next jobs. … He will be one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the country in 2018.” -- At its heart, Walker’s comeback strategy is all about being present. The governor is good at raising big bucks, but he’s got no personal wealth. He comes from a modest background and never finished college. He eats ham and cheese sandwiches from a brown paper bag for lunch most days. This is part of his political identity. He routinely tweets pictures of the simple meal. So it’s not too surprising that he was giddy when a friend at the tailgate party gave him a Green Bay jersey with his name emblazoned on the back and the number “50” to commemorate his birthday. Walker said he’s always wanted a customized jersey. In 2006, when the Packers traded Javon Walker to the Broncos, he found his jersey on clearance at a sporting good’s store for $9.99. He bought all the jerseys that were left and gave them to everyone in the Walker family as Christmas gifts. It was dipping below 30 degrees in the backyard, and he was about to walk over to watch the game. Walker, in jeans, already had four layers on to keep warm, including a Packers jacket. “Now I’ll have another layer,” he exclaimed. Midwesterners talk a lot about layers, especially this time of year. As he mingled, posing for selfies and talking about tapping beer kegs, his go-to small talk was about cold-weather gear. “I really like your gloves,” Walker told one gentleman. “I’ve got an extra pair if you need some,” the man replied earnestly. (This is also a very Midwestern thing to offer.) At a rally the next morning outside Appleton, Walker had changed into a red University of Wisconsin windbreaker. He joked that he wasn’t wearing green because the Packers had lost the game. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: A gunman opened fire at multiple locations across a small Northern California community on Tuesday, killing four people before he was slain by police. Chris Dignam reports. -- Four people are dead after a gunman opened fire at multiple locations in Northern California, picking “random targets” before he was shot and killed by police. Mark Berman, Susan Svrluga and Ellie Silverman report: “This latest burst of gunfire to terrorize a community … unfolded without an immediate explanation, as the gunman spewed bullets across what police described as ‘a very widespread area.’ Ten people were injured and taken to area hospitals, including at least two children, one of whom was at the elementary school, police said. No children were among those killed…” Still, authorities warned that Tuesday’s carnage could have been much worse. “When the gunman arrived at [the elementary school], he rammed the fence and marched onto the grounds wielding a semi-automatic rifle and wearing a vest embedded with additional clips … But when the gunman arrived, [authorities] said, he was unable to enter the classrooms, because school officials had heard gunfire and immediately locked down the premises.” Authorities said the attacker fired dozens of rounds at the school but eventually abandoned the premises because he couldn't get inside. Officials praised school officials who saved “countless lives and children.” -- Zimbabwe's military took control of the country and its president, Robert Mugabe, in an apparent coup. Wendy Muperi and Paul Schemm report: The military made “a televised announcement saying it was ‘not a military takeover.’ Despite the assurances, the events bore all the hallmarks of a coup, with military vehicles stationed around the capital, the army taking over the television station and a uniformed general issuing a statement. The move by army commander Gen. Constantino Chiwenga came as the struggle over who will succeed the country’s increasingly frail 93-year-old leader came to a head. Mugabe has ruled since he led the country to independence from white minority rule in 1980. … The fate of Mugabe and his wife, 53-year-old Grace Mugabe, who increasingly looked set to succeed him, was unclear but they appear to be in military custody.” GET SMART FAST:​​ China said that it would send an envoy to North Korea.

A source said of the book, “It’s about his time at the White House — all 10 days of it!” (Page Six) THE TAX PLAN BECOMES A HEALTH-CARE PLAN: -- Senate Republicans have added a repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate to their tax plan, a big development that allows the GOP another shot at eliminating a big piece of the Affordable Care Act. But the decision could also cause major headaches for Republicans. Mike DeBonis and Damian Paletta report: “They also announced that the individual tax cuts in the plan would be made temporary, expiring at the end of 2025 to comply with Senate rules limiting the impact of legislation on the long-term deficit. A corporate tax cut, reducing the rate from 35 to 20 percent, would be left permanent. The changes introduce volatile variables into what was already a challenging political enterprise for Republicans. And it’s unclear whether they will help or hurt the bill’s chances.” What would happen if the mandate, which forces Americans to buy health insurance or pay a fine, was repealed? Mike and Damian report that it “would free up more than $300 billion in government funding over the next decade that Republicans could use to finance their proposed tax cuts, but it would result in 13 million fewer people having health insurance, according to projections from the [CBO.] … The CBO has also projected that repealing the individual mandate would drive up insurance premiums for many Americans by roughly 10 percent.” -- The government would lose money by repealing the mandate’s penalty, but it would save much more as millions of people went without insurance. Carolyn Y. Johnson explains: “[G]overnment spending on subsidies to help people afford coverage would plummet ... The number of people without insurance would increase for two reasons. Some healthy people who are buying health insurance today because of the penalty would stop buying it. But that would have ripple effects: As fewer of those healthy people signed up for insurance, premiums would increase to pay for the health-care costs of a sicker group of people. Those rising premiums, in turn, would price more healthy people out of the market, creating a vicious cycle. The net effect is that the government will spend far less on subsidies.” -- So, will the plan pass with the mandate repeal? Our colleagues add: “The attack on former president Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement is likely to rule out the already slim possibility of support from Democrats, and the prospect of adding millions to the ranks of the uninsured could trouble moderate Republicans who voted down previous repeal efforts. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) … said Tuesday that including the repeal measure ‘complicates’ the tax effort. But she suggested she might be able to support it if the Senate also passes a bipartisan bill to preserve other aspects of the [ACA]. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) … declined to say whether he would back a tax bill that included repeal.” VIDEO: CEOs asked if they plan to increase their company's capital investments if the GOP's tax bill passes.

The Health 202: Four possible explanations for the shocking Obamacare enrollment figures,"THE PROGNOSIS President Trump delivers remarks before signing a proclamation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War during an event with U.S. military veterans in Danang, Vietnam (REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst) Want more stories about how health-care policy affects you? Read Paige Winfield Cunningham. Americans are flocking to Healthcare.gov in greater numbers than ever before in a development that runs precisely contrary to the doom-and-gloom everyone had predicted for this enrollment season. I think it’s safe to say that last year, the Obama administration would have pretty much killed for the shockingly brisk pace of Obamacare signups in the first four days the federal health insurance website opened for business. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced yesterday that more than 600,000 people selected plans from Nov. 1 through 4. Those figures appear quite a bit higher than last year, when just over a million people selected plans in the first dozen days (the best comparison available at this point). More than one in five of those people — 137,322 — were new enrollees. That’s despite the Trump administration’s much cooler attitude toward Healthcare.gov and Obamacare more generally. It seems certain the administration was trying to undercut enrollment figures by halting TV and radio advertising for the open enrollment season, chopping off navigator fund for groups that help people sign up and doing only the bare minimum to let people know they can start shopping. From Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation: 601,462 people signed up on the ACA federal marketplace in the first 4 days of open enrollment, including 137,322 new consumers. It's too early to draw conclusions, but it's clear the law isn't dead.https://t.co/xTWGAkyCPh Former acting CMS head under President Obama: ACA enrollment so far...2016: 78,000 ppl/day2017: 84,000 ppl day2018: 150,000 ppl/dayIn the face of suppressed outreach from Trump... I should emphasize that it’s still just the very beginning of the six-week signup period -- and way too early to know how this year will turn out in comparison to years past. But the initial trajectory is one that virtually no one predicted. Let’s explore a few reasons why this might be: 1. More Americans can get more generous subsidies this year. This is a phenomenon stemming from Trump’s decision to cut off extra payments to insurers for cost-sharing reductions they must offer. We elaborated on this effect in Monday’s The Health 202, but here’s the quick-and-dirty explanation: To make up for losing the payments, many insurers hiked prices for their mid-grade “silver plans.” And because premium subsidies are based on silver plan prices, the subsidies are going up too, making bronze and gold plans even cheaper for many low-income people. “I really believe the availability of these very low-cost plans could be a game changer,” said Josh Peck, who served as Healthcare.gov’s chief marketing officer under Obama and now heads up the group Get America Covered. Enrollees eligible for subsidies will get $555 on average to offset the cost of their plans, up 45 percent from this year’s $382 average tax credit, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Point 2: It would be even better 4 ppl of all incomes & geos if Trump hadn't created uncertainty, repressed competition/enrollment, etc. 7/ 2. People with a Healthcare.gov account are still getting reminder emails. I know this because I created an account several years ago. I’ve received at least four reminder emails in the last week, telling me I should visit the website to search for a plan. So have others: NYT's Margot Sanger-Katz: https://t.co/FKjaESoJ24 is sending signup reminders, with details on the open enrollment period. I just got this one. pic.twitter.com/gIGSS2R9U5 Over the last four years, the Obama administration created a large database of email addresses for past and current enrollees. Even though it appears the Trump administration isn’t using some of the email messaging strategies that were effective in years past – like telling people they could find cheaper plans on Healthcare.gov if they shopped around – email remains a major way Americans remember to sign up. 3. Maybe brokers are kicking butt. Before the Obama administration instituted more restrictions on the role of private brokers, they’d helped enroll an estimated 40 to 50 percent of marketplace customers. In California, brokers accounted for 43 percent of new enrollments on the state’s Covered California exchange during the second year of enrollment. The Trump administration reversed the crackdown in a rule last spring, allowing brokers to once again enroll people in marketplace plans through their own websites. This could lead to brokers filling a hole left by the administration’s refusal to promote the law. EHealth, one of the largest online brokers licensed to sell marketplace plans in all 50 states, said the new rules allow the company to once again find it profitable to help people sign up for marketplace coverage. “Web-based entities bring younger and healthier participants in the system,” the company’s CEO Scott Flanders told me. “So it's very healthy for the viability of ACA for web-based brokers to bring in a higher share of enrollees.” 4. Advertising drives enrollment near the end of signup season, not the beginning of it. If the reduced advertising dollars do have a dampening effect on enrollment, that effect won’t be apparent until near the end of the signup season, Peck told me. Outreach is less important at the very beginning of the season because that’s when the most motivated customers are signing up. Last year, the Obama administration didn’t run any TV ads during the first week of open enrollment, Peck said. “Outreach has an outsize effect the last week or two weeks of open enrollment,” Peck said.

Voters reject the GOP's tax ideas,"The latest Post-ABC News poll shows Americans figure — correctly — that the Republican tax plan is going to benefit the rich: A third of Americans support [President] Trump’s tax plan, while 50 percent oppose it, a 17-point negative margin driven by overwhelming opposition from Democrats and skepticism among political independents and people with lower incomes. The poll was conducted Sunday through Wednesday, completed before House Republican leaders released their bill Thursday. Six in 10 say Trump’s proposals on cutting taxes favor the rich, a perception that has dogged Republican efforts in pursuing tax restructuring for months. That opinion is not fatal, as a similar share said the same about George W. Bush’s tax proposals in 2003, though his 70 percent job approval ratings provided more political capital than Trump’s standing, which is at or below 40 percent in recent polling. Moreover, the intensity is with those who oppose the plan. Thirty-four percent strongly disapprove, while only 20 percent strongly approve. Trump should worry that so far independents are strongly opposed to the plan (52 percent to 29 percent), as are those with no college education (50 percent to 32 percent), who have been a key base of support for him. The perception that this is a plan primarily benefiting the rich and corporations may grow when more details about the plan become known. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a center-left think tank, explains the impact of just one provision, the 25 percent pass-through rate: About 80 percent of the tax cut on existing pass-through income would flow to households with incomes over $1 million.  Their tax cuts would average roughly $50,000 apiece in 2018, boosting their after-tax incomes by more than 2 percent. This extreme tilt reflects the fact that the bulk of pass-through income flows to high-income households and that they would get a larger tax break on each dollar of pass-through income (because they are in higher income tax brackets). In addition, the notion that this is a break for “small business” is false: “Some 86 percent of filers with pass-through income are currently taxed at a statutory marginal income tax rate at 25 percent or lower. So under the GOP proposal to set the top rate on pass-through income at 25 percent, most taxpayers with pass-through income would not benefit.” For that reason, the National Federation of Independent Business opposes the plan. Moreover, because most Americans oppose tax cuts for corporations, a plan that disproportionately benefits corporations will be a hard sell. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget finds: “Of the $1.5 trillion cost, roughly $1 trillion comes from business tax cuts. Individual tax cuts make up another $300 billion, and the ultimate repeal of the estate tax accounts for the remaining $200 billion.” In short, when at least 80 percent of the breaks go to corporations or rich heirs, Republicans will be on defense. When the remaining $300 billion in individual tax breaks provides additional help for the rich (e.g. a rate reduction from 39.6 percent to 35 percent for those making between $480,000 and $1 million), it quickly becomes obvious that tax breaks for the middle class are an afterthought. As Jim Tankersley puts it, the bill is “a clear windfall for corporate America and a roll of the dice for the middle-class families that President Trump promised would be the centerpiece of his economic agenda.” If, as some estimates say, some 13 million individuals with an income of $100,000 or less could wind up paying more, Democrats will have a field day painting this as further evidence that Trump has betrayed his working-class base. They will point to some obvious inequities — a permanent corporate-tax reduction but a five-year expiration on the child tax credit. Republicans need not have proceeded in this fashion. They could have undertaken revenue-neutral corporate-tax reform and tax cuts only for those making, say, less than $75,000. That, however, would not have pleased their big donors. Now the GOP will pay the political price for a bait-and-switch, just as it did on Trumpcare, which paid for tax cuts for the very rich by cutting Medicaid. Republicans seem incapable of avoiding these reverse Robin Hood schemes. Perhaps they really do care only about the rich.

"Republicans explain their health care changes in a word, or two",
What Americans are afraid of in the age of Trump,"Just in time for Halloween, Chapman University has released its fourth annual survey of American fears. Among other things, the survey asks respondents how afraid they are of more than 70 scary subjects, including spiders, medical bills and thermonuclear war. Relative to last year, the list shows there has been a shift in anxieties with the dawn of the Trump administration. “The 2017 list of fears clearly reflects political unrest and uncertainty in the wake of Donald Trump’s election as president,” the study's authors wrote. Government corruption was tops on this year's list, with 75 percent of respondents saying they were afraid of it, up from 61 percent last year. Beyond corruption, people were most concerned about health care, North Korea and pollution, a reflection in part of the topics in the news when the survey was administered this spring. Below you'll find a chart comparing the complete lists of fears last year and this year. It's long, so look it over, and we'll meet at the bottom to discuss. One thing to note about these numbers: The survey didn't ask people to rate their fears against each other. They simply asked whether they were afraid of each item on the list. Americans' #2 fear wasn't even on the list last year:  Trumpcare. More than 55 percent of respondents said they were afraid or very afraid of the Trump administration's attempts to repeal Obamacare. On the other hand, about 34 percent said they were afraid of Obamacare. The pollution of oceans, lakes, rivers and drinking water occupies the next two slots on the 2017 list of top fears, a big change from previous years. “Environmental issues never cracked the top ten fears in our previous surveys,” Chapman's authors wrote. They believe the change is related to what's been going on in Washington this year — when the survey was administered in May, for instance, the Trump administration was considering whether to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. The administration was also firing Environmental Protection Agency scientists around that time. Other environmental anxieties in the top 10 included air pollution (45 percent feared it, more than double the 21 percent who feared it last year) and climate change (feared by 48 percent, up from 32 percent). A perennial anxiety is not having enough money for the future, which appeared in the top 10 fears both this year and last. The share of Americans citing that as a concern increased to 50 percent, up from 40 percent last year. Another big category of fear this year is existential threats. Last year, for instance, about one-third of Americans were worried about the country getting involved with another world war. This year, closer to 50 percent rate that as a fear. Similarly, 48 percent of Americans say they're worried about North Korea's nuclear ambitions, which wasn't asked about last year. Also notable in this year's list of top fears is what's absent from it: terrorism, the death of loved ones, and government restrictions on guns. While similar numbers of people said they fear those events relative to last year, this year they have been superseded by the other concerns listed above. Going farther down the list things start to get a little esoteric. Sharks, for instance, are about as frightful (25 percent) to people as serious illness, theft, and computers taking their jobs. People ranked reptiles as slightly more scary than hurricanes, although, had the survey been conducted after the summer's record-breaking storm season those numbers would have been different. There has also been a drop in the percent of people who say that they're afraid of whites losing their majority status in this country, from 18 percent last year to 11 percent this year. Americans now rank that inevitable event as about as scary as the risk of a massive volcanic eruption. The least-scary thing on the list this year? “Animals,” which are feared by less than 4 percent of the population — just below the percent of respondents who said they were afraid of ghosts and zombies. "
When giving himself a perfect score on Puerto Rico isn't the nuttiest part . . .,"In a meandering, self-congratulatory news conference today in which he awarded himself a perfect “10” on Puerto Rico hurricane relief efforts (keep in mind, about 80 percent of residents still lack electricity) and he dredged up a repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory about Hillary Clinton and Russian uranium (is the special counsel rattling him?), the weirdest part of President Trump’s comments in the Oval Office concerned health care. Recall that he was for, then against, then for (sort of) the Alexander-Murray bill to facilitate payment of health-care subsidy payments, also known as cost-sharing reductions (CSRs). On Thursday, Trump tossed out this word salad. The Post reported: The president told reporters Thursday that while he prefers providing federal health finding in a block grant to states, he is open to a different approach for a finite period. “There will be a transition period so anything they’re working on will be short term,” Trump said, referring to Alexander and Murray. “It’ll be absolutely short term because, ultimately, we will be — it’s going to be repeal and replace.” The president has repeatedly decried the idea of paying money to insurers, which is the way cost-sharing payments are distributed. “So, I have great respect, as you know, for both of the senators that you mentioned and if they can come up with a short-term solution,” he said, without finishing the sentence. “What I did say though is, I don’t want the insurance companies making any more money . . . than they have to.” The bill has always been a short-term solution so the only thing that has changed is Trump — over and over again. He reportedly called Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) at least twice on Wednesday. More helpful to Alexander and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) than Trump’s contradictory meanderings are GOP co-sponsors, of which there are now a total of 12 (with 12 Democrats), more than enough to pass the bill if it comes to the floor. Alexander told his colleagues today: “This is a first step: Improve it, and pass it sooner rather than later. Our purpose is to stabilize and then lower the cost of premiums in the individual insurance market for the year 2018 and 2019.” He said pointedly, “Unless [the CSRs] are replaced with something else temporarily, there will be chaos in this country and millions of Americans will be hurt.” He also made a point of relating that he told the president this was not an insurance company bailout, but that the CSRs were designed to let low-income Americans pay their premiums. Just a day ago Trump said he wouldn’t do anything about the chaos he created by cutting off the CSRs; today he has a different answer. This is emblematic of a president who doesn’t know what he wants, what he is talking about or what is in legislation. A Senate staffer wryly remarked that the staffer’s boss didn’t really know where the president stood. “It depends on the time of day,” the senator purportedly said. Another frustrated staff member, when asked if the president was now supportive of a congressional fix to the CSRs replied good-naturedly: “Who the heck knows?!” That it seems is the best summation of Trump’s entire presidency. Good luck to the GOP getting tax reform done. They’ll need it.

Trump gives Democrats a lifeline,"The latest CNN poll should be a wake-up call for Republicans. Among its findings: President Trump’s approval rating is at a dismal 37 percent, with his disapproval rating reaching 57 percent. It seems that core group, a third of most every poll, is the only segment of the electorate for which he and anything attached to him are not toxic. A remarkably similar 34 percent approve of his tax plan, while 52 percent do not. Less than a third think the tax plan will improve the economy. And to make matters worse for Trump, 67 percent think he should release his tax returns, while only 24 percent do not. The safest vote for many members of Congress would be to vote for a requirement for Trump to release his taxes and against the Trump tax bill. Just as Republicans attempted to tie President Barack Obama’s name to every policy they disliked (Obamacare, most especially) Democrats will soon figure out that “Trumpcare” and “the Trump tax plan” will set off alarm bells for a majority of voters. However, since Trump does still command a relatively high degree of support (70 percent) from Republicans — although less than the 80-plus percent support that polls earlier in the year reported — his constant harping on the House and Senate GOP may explain why the Republicans’ generic congressional polling number is so atrocious. According to CNN’s poll, 51 percent want a Democrat for Congress, while only 37 percent want a Republican. The GOP nose dive now shows up in individual races. The Cook Political Report tells us: “Based on recent developments in races and conversations with candidates and operatives on both sides of the aisle, many races have the potential to become more competitive. This week, we’re changing our ratings in 12 districts.” Spoiler alert: All are shifting away from Republicans. Cook now rates one GOP seat (retiring Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s seat in Florida’s 27th Congressional District) as leaning to the Democrats, 12 GOP seats as toss-ups and 23 GOP seats as only “lean Republican.” Put differently, of the 45 competitive seats, 36 are held by the GOP. If it loses 24, Democrats win the House majority. Charlie Cook quotes one Democratic strategist as saying Trump blames the GOP for his woes, which “has a ring of truth to voters because very rarely does someone criticize their own party. So in swing voters’ minds, it must have some truth because it is so abnormal.” Trump is thereby helping to undermine support for the GOP among the shrinking base of party regulars who still support the GOP House and Senate leadership. To recap, Trump and policies linked to him are toxic with a large majority of non-Republicans. Meanwhile, his vilification of Republican leaders is helping depress their support among Republicans and in turn risking substantial losses in the House. As for the Senate, Trump’s ally Stephen K. Bannon is bent on running extremist challengers. He provides constant reinforcement for Trump’s rhetoric that members of the GOP “establishment” (i.e. incumbents) are no-good, incompetent swamp creatures blocking the Trump agenda. Two Senate seats (Nevada and Arizona) are already at risk of flipping, and with the announcement that Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) is retiring and popular Democratic ex-governor Phil Bredesen may run, Tennessee now becomes more competitive. With another GOP retirement or two and a goofy Bannonite winning a primary here and there, the Senate majority will be up for grabs. Democrats may not have a cogent agenda, but they have Trump, which may turn out to be all they need.

Does Trump want to destroy our health-care system? He can't seem to decide.,"Everybody says they want bipartisan solutions to complex problems, but what happens when a bipartisan solution actually shows up? In Donald Trump’s Washington, the answer is that whether it actually comes to fruition depends on the shifting whims of a president who doesn’t understand the issue and can’t even figure out what he wants to do. President Trump is facing a dilemma: Does he want to destroy the American health-care system or not? At this point, all evidence suggests that he genuinely can’t decide what the answer to that question is. As you know, Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) have announced that they reached an agreement on a short-term plan to stabilize the health-care exchanges. It would continue the cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments in the Affordable Care Act that Trump recently announced he’d be halting; give states greater flexibility to receive waivers of certain requirements in the ACA; restore funding for outreach to encourage people to sign up for coverage, which the administration has slashed; and allow more people to get high-deductible “catastrophic” coverage. In other words, the compromise offers something for Democrats and something for Republicans. By no means would it solve every issue the law has, but it’s meant to provide some short-term certainty, which should slow the dramatic premium increases insurers have requested since the Trump administration began its campaign of sabotage against the law. When the Alexander-Murray agreement was announced yesterday, Trump at first seemed supportive. “It is a short-term solution, so that we don’t have this very dangerous little period — including dangerous periods for insurance companies,” he said at a press conference. “For a period of one year, two years, we will have a very good solution.” But then this morning, he tweeted, “I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co’s who have made a fortune w/ O’Care.” What gives? When you try to interpret the president’s shifting positions — and figure out how this is all going to end — there are a few things you have to keep in mind. First, it’s wise to assume that he has no idea how any provision of this agreement or the ACA itself actually works, and that will not change. For instance, he seems to have convinced himself that cost-sharing reductions are like an extra bonus given to insurance companies that they’ll just use to pad their profits. “That money is going to insurance companies to lift up their stock price,” he has said, when in fact the money is basically passed through the insurers to provide lower co-payments and deductibles for people with low incomes. He hasn’t bothered to learn what the law does, and he certainly isn’t going to quickly get up to speed on new proposals to provide technical fixes. Second, you have to remember that Trump has no ideological principles on health care that can provide us a guide to what he might do. At various times he has embraced viciously cruel Republican plans that would cut off coverage for tens of millions, and said he wants the government to provide “insurance for everybody.” He simply has no consistent beliefs on this subject (and, of course, on many others). Third, he is pushed in different directions by competing impulses, any one of which may dominate at a particular moment. It has become clear that there may be no desire that governs his actions more than his need to destroy and discredit everything Barack Obama did. We can debate why this is; my view is that Trump, who is obviously a deeply insecure man, looks at Obama and sees someone who is his superior in almost every way — smarter, more competent, more admired and respected — and is enraged by the inevitable comparisons. But the fact that Trump is driven to undo anything with Obama’s name on it is undeniable. That goes a long way toward explaining why Trump is so eager to destroy the individual insurance market, at the cost of enormous anxiety and suffering among the public, when his advisers have surely explained to him that he will be held responsible for whatever happens to American health care on his watch. No matter how much it costs him politically, he wants to be able to say that Obamacare is dead, he killed it, and it was a terrible thing in the first place. However, at the same time Trump is desperate to show that he can make a deal. The failure of the GOP effort to repeal the ACA plainly weighs on him. Despite his belief that he is the greatest dealmaker in human history, you may have noticed that he has negotiated precisely zero deals of any magnitude since becoming president. The Republican Congress has passed no major legislation this year. Trump’s increasingly desperate and comical insistence that he is piling up an awe-inspiring record of accomplishment — “in nine months, we have done more, they say, than any president in history,” he said today — only highlights his eagerness to have something he can say he actually got done. Which raises the question of what he would do if the Alexander-Murray agreement actually passed both houses of Congress and found its way to his desk. My guess is that if he were actually presented with the choice he’d sign it, if for no other reason than that issuing a veto would be taking a firm stand. But before we get there, he’s going to keep undermining it with his public comments. That will only add fuel to the belief of ultra-right Republicans in the House that any bill that doesn’t set Barack Obama’s legacy aflame is a compromise with their beliefs and therefore unacceptable. All of which suggests that though the Alexander-Murray agreement sounds like a perfectly reasonable thing to do and something Democrats and Republicans ought to be able to agree on, it’s more likely than not that it will fail. That won’t be entirely Trump’s fault, but he certainly won’t be helping.

"Trump's dumbfounding, expansive press conference with Mitch McConnell, annotated","President Trump took part in an extensive Q&A with reporters Monday in which he falsely accused his predecessors of not calling the families of fallen soldiers, suggested Puerto Rico shouldn't need food and water distributed by the military, and said he might rethink his drug czar nominee after a blockbuster Washington Post/60 Minutes"" report on the opioid epidemic. It was Trump's most extensive back-and-forth with reporters in months"
Trump the destroyer,"What is increasingly obvious is that President Trump’s motivations and impulses have everything to do with narcissism, personal piques, anger at his predecessor and fear of losing face — and very little to do with creating real policy outcomes. He prefers to be seen doing something rather than to do something for which he would bear the consequences. We’ve seen this on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, health care and taxes. At the behest of his anti-immigrant advisers Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller, he rescinds DACA on the grounds that it is unconstitutional, but not so unconstitutional as to end right away. He sets a March deadline, then gets cold feet and promises “Chuck and Nancy” he will agree to a DACA fix for more border security. Miller tries to nix the deal with ridiculous demands. Trump gets nervous once again and on Thursday tells Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a co-sponsor of a GOP bill to legalize “dreamers,” that he’ll extend the March deadline for ending DACA, which was supposed to be unconstitutional. Got it? It’s smoke and mirrors, and puffery for the base, followed by retreats. The lives of hundreds of thousands of young people are irrelevant to him. He wants a “win,” and he wants his base to be happy. On the Affordable Care Act, he could not piece together a workable replacement that could get through Congress, so by executive order he seeks to sow chaos, wreck the exchanges and carry out what some have described as “synthetic repeal.” He will create loopholes for health-care associations to offer cheaper (i.e. high-deductible, non-compliant insurance) and turn temporary coverage plans (also non-compliant) into substitutes for ACA-approved plans. Then the kicker: He’ll stop paying the subsidies that insurers were promised to cushion them from losses. The Post reports: Ending the payments is grounds for any insurer to back out of its federal contract to sell health plans for 2018. Some states’ regulators directed ACA insurers to add a surcharge in case the payments were not made — but insurers elsewhere could be left in a position in which they still must give consumers the discounts but will not be reimbursed. . . . One person familiar with the president’s decision said that HHS officials and Trump’s domestic policy advisers had urged him to continue the payments at least through the end of the year. The cost-sharing payments are separate from a different subsidy that provides federal assistance with premiums to more than four-fifths of the 10 million Americans with ACA coverage. Those subsidies for individuals will rise as premiums soar, shifting more cost to taxpayers and adding to the deficit. The upshot is that insurers may then flee the exchanges or raise premiums. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that ending the cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) would have dramatic consequences: “Premiums for 2018 would increase by 20% over the CBO’s current baseline and by 25% over the 2020 projection … [and] since premiums would increase with no CSRs, Americans would need more help paying the higher costs through subsidies. The increased cost of subsidies, said the CBO, would be greater than simply funding the CSRs.” In addition, CBO estimated that as insurers fled, about 5 percent of the country would not have access to the exchanges. After the lawsuits by states (including California and New York) and/or insurers, Congress could fix all this by, for example, the compromise plan Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) were working on. If Trump gets his way, he will have created Trumpcare, a failing system that will disrupt the insurance market, drive up costs and leave many more Americans uninsured. This is the great plan he had in mind? His “solution” to Obamacare is to make it much worse and blame others. He, as with DACA, has no solutions of his own, none that he can comprehend and push through Congress. Republicans in Congress foolishly cheer this mindless destruction, as if they have forgotten (or never thought through) how to improve health care for Americans. Turning to the tax front, Trump’s giddy language about middle-class tax relief doesn’t match the half-baked tax outline he put out. In fact, some middle-class taxpayers will pay more because, as Josh Barro points out, the plan takes away the personal exemption, but the substitute (an increase in the standard deduction) doesn’t fully compensate some taxpayers: “Abolishing the personal exemption would raise $1.6 trillion over 10 years. The measures designed to offset that change — the larger standard deduction and dependent credits — would only reduce taxes by $1.1 trillion, meaning a net tax hike of $500 billion aimed largely at the middle and upper-middle class.”) The plan, in short, was either never thought through or never intended really to focus on middle-class taxpayers. (“Abolishing personal exemptions is a revenue-raising option that hits middle-income families unusually hard.”) Trump and/or Congress could fix the plan and align it with their rhetoric, but that would entail cutting out items intended solely to benefit the super-rich (e.g. abolishing the estate tax, lowering the top rate to 35 percent and creating a 25 percent pass-through rate). Trump, as he did on DACA and health care, isn’t creating tax policy of tangible value to ordinary Americans; he’s flapping his arms, misrepresenting the plan and getting ready to blame Congress when the whole thing flops. In sum, on DACA, health care and taxes, Trump never had a clue what he would offer to replace policies that he vilified. Now he’s content to tear away at policies that help at least some people, substituting rhetoric and faux legislation that has not been carefully considered. He is playing a president on TV for his low-information viewers. He’s not governing, however, and he sure isn’t “winning.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The Health 202: The health-care fight is back -- as part of the GOP's tax overhaul.,"THE PROGNOSIS Speaker of House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announce the Republican tax rewrite. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post) Republicans took a swing at Medicaid spending in their Obamacare rollback bills this year — and missed badly. Yet they’re taking another whack as part of a tax code rewrite. Yes, you read that right. Health care is such a huge chunk of the federal budget that it’s part of virtually any spending conversation on Capitol Hill. That’s likely to hold true as Republicans launch their next big, partisan legislative goal: overhauling the U.S. tax code. This morning, the Senate Budget Committee will consider a resolution that instructs lawmakers to find ways to reduce Medicaid spending by $1 trillion (and Medicare spending by $473 billion) over the next decade, according to supporting documentation that Democrats are publicizing. The idea is to clear the way for tax cuts by trimming from the two entitlement programs, which together consume a quarter of the federal budget. Republicans have moved on from their failed health-care attempts with high hopes that they’ll be able to make their mark on taxes — the second major priority that House and Senate leaders have set their sights on. The two chambers have each rolled out their own tax outlines, which they’d have to eventually merge. But Senate Republicans are opening the door to even deeper Medicaid cuts than in the health-care bills conceived over the spring and summer. And the GOP could barely advance those bills. The House’s American Health Care Act would have reduced Medicaid spending by $880 billion and the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act would have chopped off about $750 billion over 10 years. Although conservative Republicans were fine with those reductions — arguing that the current spending trajectory is unsustainable, anyway — moderates balked. The House barely scraped together enough votes for its bill after multiple attempts, and after falling several votes short in July the Senate eventually gave up. Republicans learned this hard lesson: Cutting entitlement programs is almost impossible if you don’t want to risk losing seats in the next election. Multiple polls showed that both the House and Senate health-care bills were deeply unpopular. Moderate senators publicly griped about the Medicaid reductions and enough refused to support them. It's just really, really hard to take free stuff away from voters, especially if they don't earn much. And there’s another catch: President Trump promised multiple times during his campaign that he wouldn’t cut Medicare. The president hasn’t commented specifically on the potential entitlement cuts that his party appears to be exploring as part of tax reform. In defense of their strategy, Republicans are stressing the same points they did with the health-care bills. Medicaid and Medicare spending would still grow in absolute terms over the next decade, just more slowly, the office of Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) stressed to me. The reductions are spread over a 10-year period, not all at once. And the proposed reductions could change, too, as the committees with jurisdiction would have to formally propose them and decide how to achieve them. This could be done in several ways, by reducing provider reimbursements or increasing patient contribution or cutting benefits or some combination. Yet it’s still hard to see how Republicans don’t risk the same kind of political fallout on taxes, which they’re also trying to cut without any Democratic support through a budget reconciliation bill that needs just 51 votes, not 60, in the Senate. Of course, Democrats are working hard to capitalize on all this, fresh off their victory in the health-care arena. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) speak during a news conference on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) “Republicans used their Trumpcare bill to stick in tax cuts for the rich while they were officially desiccating Medicaid,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters yesterday. “Now they’re using their tax-cut plan and sneaking in cuts to Medicaid and Medicare, but it’s the same playbook.” Here's what other Democrats had to say: From Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.): Cutting Medicare and Medicaid to pay for tax cuts for those at the top - all at the expense of the middle class - is the wrong way to go. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.): The Republican budget cuts $473 billion from Medicare and $1 TRILLION from Medicaid. That’s outrageous! pic.twitter.com/lNuPXnmxFU Budget Committee ranking member Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): The Republican budget cuts Medicaid by over $1 trillion and Medicare by $473 billion over 10 years.

Can't they be better before they announce retirement?,"Right-wing Republicans are convinced that the problem with the party is that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) isn’t adept enough at forcing through legislation. The legislation (for example Trumpcare or tax cuts for the rich) is hugely unpopular and often does not do what Republican say it does. Rather than fix what they are selling, they along with President Trump’s populists would prefer new and even more extreme leaders (e.g. Roy Moore). A large number of elected Republicans understand they are trying to foist junk legislation on the public. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) appeared on “Meet the Press” Sunday. He was asked about the tax cut plan adding to the deficit: CORKER: I’m willing to accept a reasonable score on dynamic growth. A reasonable score on dynamic growth. Joint tax does those. There’re some other groups that do it. But if it looks like to me, Chuck, we’re adding one penny to the deficit, I am not going to be for it, okay? I’m sorry. It is the greatest threat to our nation. The greatest threat to our nation. It’s like, Chuck, we’ve entered a party atmosphere here. You know, everybody was a fiscal hawk, kind of. Not really, but kind of, up until the election. Now, it’s like there’s a party going on up here, okay? Heck with revenue. Heck with, you know, constraining spending. So yes, I will remain a deficit hawk until I leave here. And I’m looking so forward to this tax reform debate because the one thing that hasn’t been discussed is the four trillion dollars in base broadeners that have to occur for this to be successful, and every lobbyist in the world is gonna be up here fighting those. CHUCK TODD: You know, it’s amazing in retirement how many Democrats are coming out and saying they’re going to miss you. CORKER: I told people if I knew they were going to say so many nice things about me, I would’ve retired earlier. I mean, it’s been wonderful. Look, I think I’m going to have more impact over the next 15 months than I’ve had in the last 10 years. TODD: A free agent. CORKER: Well, I just think the issues. I mean, the first two years of a presidency is when most of the activity takes place. We’re going to playing a leading role here in Iran here in a few weeks. Tax reform. And I look forward to working with all my colleagues here to make good things happen. Corker is among the most independent-minded, moderate Republicans. He fought hard-liners to save the car industry. He took on the far-right who didn’t want the Corker-Cardin legislation allowing Congress to exercise some say on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Unfortunately, too many of Corker’s colleagues are unwilling to rebel against junk legislation, craft compromise legislation or block clearly unqualified or ethically challenged nominees. (Thirty-six Republicans voted yes on every single nominee, some of whom have left in scandal and others who are proving to be totally in over their heads.) Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) (who dutifully backed away, at his leadership’s behest, from bipartisan health-care negotiations with a Democratic senator from Washington state), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) (who even championed one iteration of Trumpcare), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and many others not regarded as right-wing kooks surely knew that the health-care bills they supported were junk. And many can tell off the bat that the administration’s tax plan is ridiculous. Yet they keep quietly going along. Why don’t they do something, in tandem, early in the process to steer legislation like health care toward defensible, middle-of-the-road positions? The answer sadly is the power of the Trumpkin base, the right-wing media and the Beltway lobby groups (e.g. Heritage Action for America) that hammer away at dissenters, making sure lawmakers adhere to nonsensical positions. Unfortunately, rather than show willingness to make his or her current term the last, the average (or above-average) lawmaker virtually always will go along with the flow, hoping someone else (e.g. Sens. John McCain, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski) does the right thing. The pressure in favor of party cohesion and ideological extremism has mystical powers over grown men and women elected to high office. Smart lawmakers shrink and cower from the mob, fearing a primary challenge or a verbal thrashing from the right-wing echo chamber. It’s the rare lawmaker who is immune to partisan pressure and willing to go his own way. It would be refreshing for candidates of both parties to tell the voters upfront: You’re electing me to exercise my own good judgment, not to be a puppet on the string of any group or subset of voters. I’m not always going to follow the party line, so if you want a blind follower, choose someone else. I have marketable skills and am not afraid you’ll fire me after my term is up. But if you are going to join the mob that hollers at every deviation from party orthodoxy, refuses to listen to reasoned arguments and decries me as a sellout to the other party, you’re going to wind up with the same gridlock and inane governance we’ve seen year after year. The sensible center can control the outcome in most cases. These lawmakers in conjunction with moderate Democrats can pass a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals fix, nix huge cuts to Medicaid, pass fiscally responsible tax reform and devise a long-overdue infrastructure bill. To control the agenda, however, they must love their jobs less and their country more. We need lawmakers to be less responsive to the electorate and much more willing to act as responsible decision-makers, even if it risks the ire of some voters. We need more Corkers, McCains, Murkowskis, etc., and fewer who are desperate to please the nuttiest elements in their party.

The Energy 202: ANWR is back. It could make a tax code overhaul a lot harder.,"THE LIGHTBULB Lisa Murkowski trailed by members of the media in the basement of the U.S. Capitol. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) Political opponents of opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling emphasize the environmental risks of such an endeavor. Allowing fossil-fuel development in a long-contested 1.5 million-acre patch of the refuge, opponents say, would disrupt the area's wildlife, in particular the caribou that give birth within the proposed drilling site. As Republicans may soon learn, however, there is political risk to the legislative push to drill there — one that could bore a hole into the GOP’s biggest legislative goal after the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. On Friday, Senate Republicans took their first legislative step to allowing drilling in ANWR. A draft measure from the Senate Budget Committee instructs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to find a way of generating an additional $1 billion in revenue. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) chairs that committee — and is widely expected to identify allowing the extraction and sale of the oil under ANWR as a method of raising that revenue. That legislative maneuver allows Senate Republicans to approve drilling in the Arctic refuge with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a Democratic filibuster. “This provides an excellent opportunity for our committee to raise $1 billion in federal revenues while creating jobs and strengthening our nation’s long-term energy security,” Murkowski said in a  statement Friday, without explicitly mentioning ANWR. “I am confident that our committee is prepared to meet the instruction in this resolution.” Republicans have been down this road before: In 1995, a GOP-controlled Congress passed a budget allowing refuge drilling — but the measure was vetoed by President Bill Clinton. With Republicans in control of both Congress and the White House, a presidential veto is no longer a hurdle. Indeed, Trump's Interior Department in September lifted restrictions on seismic studies to access how much oil is under the refuge. The road to energy dominance goes through Alaska"
Democrats need a 4-prong plan to beat Trump and his philosophy,"President Trump contributed nothing to Alabama Sen. Luther Strange’s failing election bid. He is actually a drag on another Republican, Ed Gillespie, who struggles these days to keep up with Democrat Ralph Northam in Virginia’s gubernatorial race. According to the Christopher Newport University’s poll: A Christopher Newport University survey released this week found that 39 percent of Virginia voters said Trump will factor into their vote in November’s gubernatorial election . . . A little more than half of Northam voters, or 51 percent, said Trump is a factor, while 72 percent of Gillespie voters said the president won’t sway their decision. “Disapproval of Trump and Congress is clearly motivating Northam’s voters,” said Rachel Bitecofer, assistant director of CNU’s Wason Center for Public Policy. “Gillespie voters mostly support Trump, but they’d rather keep him out of the picture here. Trump is such an inviting target for Democrats they hardly know where to begin the argument for 2018 — his incompetence, racism, disloyalty to working-class voters, divisiveness, dishonesty, contempt for the rule of law, or sheer cruelty?  (He now mocks the posture of Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is battling brain cancer and to this day cannot lift his arms above his head due to torture he underwent in Vietnam — while Trump was using “bone spurs” to keep himself out of the war.) However, Democrats will be running against Republicans in the House and Senate. It would behoove Democrats to keep several arguments in mind in the run-up to the 2018 midterms. First, Republicans nearly eviscerated health-care coverage for millions of Americans and have vowed to keep trying. So intent on keeping a bumper-sticker campaign promise, they did not bother to assemble a grown-up health-care plan of their own. Instead they goaded placid members into voting for whatever slop they served up. Second, Republicans now seem intent on repeating their fixation with favoritism for the rich and corporations in their tax plan — though it’s hard to see specifically what they are seeking. It was enough however to elicit a warning from the Peter G Peterson Foundation: “A fundamental question is how tax reform will affect our nation’s unsustainable fiscal outlook, and that question remains unanswered. With the national debt above $20 trillion, no reasonable person can conclude that we should add to that amount.” Third, from conflicts of interest to charter jet flights to emoluments, Republican have refused to take oversight seriously and therefore are helping Trump deepen, not drain, the swamp. Fourth, they can present a solution for the “dreamers” that would have widespread public support and command large majorities — if only GOP leaders would allow a vote. In these four areas Democrats should warn voters that if they give the GOP majorities again in 2018 the Republicans will only double down on policy disasters such as Trumpcare and tax cuts for the rich. Instead — and here is what is key — Democrats should show voters they are prepared with bipartisan plans not only on the debt ceiling but also on DACA, health care, taxes and ethics. With concrete legislation on DACA, health care, taxes and ethics, they can dare Republican leaders to squelch these efforts (as they did on health-care negotiations between Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander and Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray) and vote against their middle-of-the-road proposals while encouraging moderates to join them. On DACA, Democrats need to remind voters of their Dream Act and offer a set amount for enhanced border and visa enforcement. According to a recent poll by The Post/ABC, this position is popular with 86 percent of voters. If the GOP nixes the Alexander-Murray bipartisan health-care effort again, Democrats should go public with a push for a sensible stabilization plan, perhaps adding a drug-cost-reduction plan. They should be tracking and highlighting efforts to sabotage Obamacare. Likewise on taxes, Democrats can dare the GOP to vote against a specific bill to reform but not cut corporate taxes. Their plan would need to be fiscally responsible. That means leaving in place or increasing taxes on the rich with reductions for middle- and lower-income Americans. (In the case of lower-income Americans this should involve giving money back in the form of tax credits and/or expansion of the earned income tax credit.) On ethics, they should seek to ban charter travel, nepotism in the West Wing, foreign emoluments and presidential conflicts of interest. And of course they should present legislation demanding presidents release their taxes and prohibiting the administration from spending money at Trump’s resorts. Republicans will have to explain why they oppose such basic anti-corruption measures. Republicans never did the hard work of creating concrete alternatives to Obamacare. Their campaign against it was enough to dislodge Democratic majorities in the House and Senate in 2010 and 2014, but left them utterly unprepared to govern when they won those majorities and the White House. For Democrats in particular, it’s critical that they set forth mainstream policies that do not leave them open to the counterattack that they are still tax and spend liberals, proponents of “open borders” or advocates of socialized medicine. (Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might be pushing single-payer health care but that’s not a position the majority of Democrats will embrace in 2018.) They can capture the “drain the swamp” meme with simple but effective measures that highlight scandalous self-enrichment. Their chances of stopping Trump in his tracks — and setting off a new round of GOP recriminations — would be enhanced if Democrats present alternatives to tempt moderates and remind the public how radical are Trump’s schemes. In stopping Trump they’d protect the country from radical policies and leave the GOP in even more disarray.

Happy Hour Roundup,"* Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan report that the GOP’s effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act is over, at least for this year: Senate Republicans decided Tuesday not to hold a vote on unwinding the Affordable Care Act, preserving the landmark 2010 law for the foreseeable future even as they suggested they may withhold crucial funding for it. The move leaves the GOP — once again — short of fulfilling a signature promise, which some Republicans worried could inspire a backlash among their base heading into the 2018 midterm elections. Several senators said they instead plan to move onto other issues now that the party’s latest proposal, authored by Republican Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (La.), had failed to garner sufficient support “Where we go from here is tax reform,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told reporters after holding a closed-door policy lunch with members of his caucus. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers voiced little interest in shoring up the existing ACA insurance market, sowing apprehension among insurers and state officials just weeks before consumers must start enrolling in plans for next year. While some GOP lawmakers expected consumers could experience major problems in the months ahead, they argued that the ongoing instability would backfire on Democrats and build momentum for the ACA’s eventual repeal. If you were looking for proof of how despicably cynical Republicans have been on this issue, you won’t do much better than those last two paragraphs. For years they’ve been saying, “Obamacare is imploding! We have to do something!” Now their position is: Eh, who gives a crap. If there’s enough human suffering, maybe it will hurt our opponents. I’d say it’s unbelievable, except it’s exactly what you’d expect from them. * Jonathan Swan reports that details of the Republican tax plan are coming into view: Top White House and GOP leaders have agreed to raise the lowest individual tax rate from 10 to 12 percent, paired with doubling the standard deduction, 5 senior Republicans tell us. Why this matters: Trump intends to sell the proposal tomorrow as a populist “tax cut.” But as recently as yesterday top Republicans on Capitol Hill were nervous as they got word that Trump wasn’t entirely thrilled with the product that had been hashed out in immense secrecy for weeks (with two members of his administration, Gary Cohn and Steven Mnuchin, working with GOP leaders.) Late last night Republicans close to the process felt more confident that Trump had come around to supporting the framework — despite his misgivings about the corporate rate not being low enough and about the political risks of raising the lowest rate (even though many more people will now pay no tax because of the increased deduction, meaning they can accurately call it a tax cut for the middle class as well as for the wealthy.) Big picture details: Republicans plan to collapse the number of brackets from seven to three. The standard deduction would almost double to $12,000 for a single filer and $24,000 for married couples, meaning Trump can accurately argue that many more low income earners would pay no tax under his plan. As we previously reported, the top tax bracket would fall from 39.6% to 35%. No, he can accurately say that many more low income earners would pay no income tax, but they’d still be paying substantial payroll tax. In any case, I can give you a 100 percent guarantee that when Trump talks about this plan, he will say many, many things about it that are utterly false. * Sahil Kapur reports that John McCain is calling for tax reform to be a bipartisan effort, which is just adorable. * Paul Kane reports that Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee will not be running for reelection next year, opening up at least the possibility of another seat Democrats could contest. * Eric Levitz explains that football was intensely political in ways conservatives wanted way before Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the national anthem. * Sam Levine reports on a study showing that Wisconsin’s voter ID law dissuaded tens of thousands of people in heavily Democratic counties from voting in 2016. * Anna Fifield reports that North Korea has been quietly seeking out Republican political operatives who can explain to them what the hell is up with Donald Trump. * David Leonhardt warns that the opposition to Trumpcare must keep up its efforts going forward, because Republicans are going to keep at it. * Jon Allsop argues that Trump’s travel ban is still a Muslim ban, and the press should say so. * Michelle Goldberg explains how and why we have slid into a situation of pervasive minority rule. * At The Week, I argued that Democrats are going to make Roy Moore into a national celebrity. * And Laura Packard relates what being blocked on Twitter by the president of the United States taught her about Donald Trump.

Three GOP Trumpcare errors will doom tax reform,"As the final nails in the coffin of Trumpcare get hammered into place, the Republicans desperately want to pivot to tax reform. Unfortunately, without understanding the multiple missteps that led to the demise of Obamacare’s “repeal and replace,” they will reach a similarly disappointing result. Let’s start with what the public wants. Frankly, tax cuts are not at the top of the list. President George W. Bush’s tax cuts took many people off the federal income-tax rolls, while the very rich have expert tax advice and are enjoying the benefits of an economy that works for them. (In 2004 Bush could boast, “Nearly 5 million taxpayers will be off the rolls as a result of the tax relief this year.”) Their combined tax bill (including sales, property, state and local taxes) may be worrisome, but federal taxes are not oppressively high. Contrary to President Trump’s statements, we are not the highest-taxed nation. (CNBC reports, “In fact, the U.S. ranks in the middle of the pack when compared with the roughly three dozen developed countries tracked by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.”) Therefore, it’s not surprising that there is not a grass-roots push for tax reform. (Donors and Goldman Sachs Cabinet members are a different story.)  The Gallup poll found in a poll in April that “Americans’ concern about their own federal tax burden had actually cooled somewhat, as barely half (51%) felt their taxes were ‘too high,’ down from 57% in 2016. By contrast, in June 1985, the year before the revolutionary Tax Reform Act of 1986 went into effect, 63% of Americans said their taxes were too high.” Lesson No. 1 of Obamacare was listen to the public’s priorities. The public wanted more health-care benefits (to have lower out-of-pocket costs); the GOP wanted to end Obamacare. That disconnect deprived Republicans of support for their health-care plans. The same will be true if the GOP thinks Americans believe everyone is overtaxed. A Washington Post-ABC poll finds: Nearly three-quarters of Americans believe that the tax system favors the wealthy — and half of Americans believe that President Trump’s tax plan will help the rich even more, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. More than 7 in 10 adults say the nation’s tax system already tends to favor the wealthy more than the middle class, with a 55 percent majority who feel this “strongly.” … A majority of Americans also believe that large corporations pay too little in taxes. Moreover, by a margin of 62 to 33 percent, voters oppose reducing taxes for the rich. (The question was not whether they get should get smaller tax relief but whether they should get any. The answer was a resounding “no.”) They haven’t yet seen Trump’s bill, but voters already don’t like it. (“When asked if they support Trump’s tax plan, opposition outpaces support by 44 to 28 percent, with nearly 3 in 10 saying they have no opinion.”) At the exact moment at which the GOP is shifting from tax reform to tax cuts, which may disproportionately benefit the rich, voters are telling us they think the tax code is not progressive enough. Lesson No. 2 from the health-care debate was not to underestimate the degree to which Americans resist benefiting the rich. (Even Republicans started abandoning tax cuts for the very rich in combination with Medicaid cuts for the poor.) Should Republicans abandon Trump’s promise that the rich “will not be gaining” under his plan, look for a backlash not just from Democrats but from the more populist corners of the GOP. Finally, voters told us during the Obamacare debate and in the wake of the debt ceiling deal that they want the parties to work together. However, in the upcoming tax fight, once again the GOP insists on proceeding with reconciliation (50 votes plus the vice president). That gives Republicans a very small margin for error. And one supposes Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), as he did with Obamacare, will insist on regular order for tax reform/cuts. Lesson No. 3 from health care was that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) does not have an iron grip on his members. He cannot always deliver 50 of 52 votes (especially if Roy Moore joins the Senate). In this case, there are many Democrats who would join tax reform so long as it was deficit neutral and did not give more cuts to the rich. A bipartisan effort could well succeed. You’d think Republicans would have figured out that would be a much more constructive and politically popular way to proceed. Nah, they seem intent on making the very same errors that doomed Trumpcare.

10 lessons from the GOP's failed effort to kill Obamacare,"Republicans are facing one final decision on their doomed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act: Should they bother to hold yet another vote in the Senate that they know they will lose, or should they acknowledge that it’s over, at least for this year? “Everybody knows that’s going to fail,” Sen. Orrin Hatch said of the Cassidy-Graham bill, now that three Republican senators — Rand Paul, John McCain and Susan Collins — have officially stated their opposition, with perhaps more to follow. But Republicans will decide today whether to hold a vote. “I think there is some advantage to showing you’re trying and doing the best you can,” said Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.). While repeal will never be truly dead until Democrats take back either a house of Congress or the presidency, this latest GOP failure gives us a chance to take stock of what we’ve learned. The lessons are many: 1. Republicans don’t care about policy. For seven years, they railed against the ACA and promised that when they had the chance, they’d repeal it and offer something better. Yet for all that time, they never bothered to sit down and work out what their replacement might look like. Then when they got control of the entire government, they still couldn’t make a serious attempt to tackle the policy challenge. The bills they came up with were hastily thrown together, full of contradictions and catastrophic consequences, and sponsored by people whose public comments made clear that they barely understood the first thing about what they were proposing. In President Trump’s immortal words, “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.” The truth was that everyone who had ever taken the issue seriously knew it — but that didn’t include more than a handful of Republicans. 2. The overwhelming majority of Republicans are more than happy to vote for bills with catastrophic consequences. All of the GOP health-care bills that were offered promised upheaval — tens of millions losing their insurance, skyrocketing premiums, death spirals in the individual markets. Yet there were never more than a few Republicans willing to say no. The rest were ready to set off a tidal wave of human suffering if it meant that they could give the finger to Barack Obama. 3. Fewer people having health coverage isn’t a bug of Republican plans; it’s a feature. Every one of the GOP plans would have resulted in millions upon millions of Americans losing their health coverage, and that was the whole point. As they’ve proved again and again, Republicans would rather see someone go without coverage than get their coverage with help from the government, whether directly through a program such as Medicaid or indirectly through subsidies. 4. Yet Americans actually like government health coverage. This realization came as a shock to Republicans, who thought they could gut Medicaid and replace it with the promise of “freedom,” and no one would mind. But they discovered to their chagrin that Medicaid is extremely popular. Republicans believed their own rhetoric, which holds that when the government does something it’s always inefficient, incompetent and cruel. But it turns out that most Americans don’t share that dogmatic belief. If government insurance is a good deal, they’re happy to get it. 5. Many of the ACA’s protections are no longer negotiable. This was a fear that many in the GOP had about the ACA from the beginning, that once you gave people benefits it would be very hard to take them away. And so it has come to pass. That’s why most Republicans tried to argue that their bills protected those with preexisting conditions, even when they didn’t: They knew that the public will not tolerate the removal of those protections. Likewise, they had to keep the ACA’s mandate that young people can stay on their parents’ insurance. Even the requirement to cover essential health benefits looks very hard to take away. 6. No one should listen to any Republican complaints about procedure again. Democrats have long charged that Republicans use procedural complaints as a weapon when Democrats are in power, then abandon all adherence to norms and rules once they’re in charge. While this has always been true, it has never been on such vivid display as it has recently, first with the roadblocked nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court and now with health care. Republicans have been complaining for years that the ACA had been “rammed through,” even though it was debated for a year and subjected to nearly 200 hearings, hundreds of amendments (including many offered by Republicans) and multiple Congressional Budget Office scores. But the GOP just tried to remake the entire American health-care system with but a single farcical hearing, no expert testimony, no full CBO score and barely any floor debate. 7. The current Republican leadership is not very good at legislating. Although Paul Ryan did manage to get one version of the bill passed in the House — remember that triumphal ceremony Trump held in the Rose Garden? — it was dead on arrival in the Senate. And Republicans were never able to arrive at a bill that could meet the approval of their caucuses in both houses. Mitch McConnell could neither craft a bill that could pass the Senate nor cajole his members into voting for the different ones that other Republicans concocted. McConnell was brilliant as a leader of the opposition but has proved to be inadequate to the task of governing. 8. Trump will, through his ignorance and impulsiveness, undermine any attempt by Republicans to pass complex legislation. Every time the president injected himself into negotiations or public debate on health care, he made things harder for Republicans in Congress, often by promising things they had no intention of delivering. He never bothered to learn anything about the subject or about the bills he was promoting, and that made everything harder for them. Just watch: The same thing is going to happen on tax reform, and on any other ambitious legislation Republicans attempt. 9. Republicans are terrified of their base voters, but still treat those voters like fools. “I could maybe give you 10 reasons why this bill shouldn’t be considered,” Sen.  Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told reporters last week. “But Republicans campaigned on this so often that you have a responsibility to carry out what you said in the campaign. That’s pretty much as much of a reason as the substance of the bill.” We heard this again and again from Republicans: Sure, this bill is awful, but if we don’t pass some kind of repeal, then we’ll be punished by our base for not doing what we told them for seven years we’d do. Yet they never respected that base enough to tell them that repeal wouldn’t be easy, which left Republicans trapped. 10. Health care is no longer an abstract debate, and citizens still have power. Republicans began thinking they could toss around pleasant words such as “freedom” and “choice” and that would obscure the human consequences of what they were proposing. But up against cancer patients describing how the ACA had enabled them to get life-saving care, or people with disabilities literally putting their bodies on the line to protest getting their Medicaid taken away, those words lost all their power. While there were many facets to the campaign to stop these bills, what mattered most was ordinary people, people who organized and called and wrote and shouted and protested and through their efforts made just enough politicians understand what was really at stake. That’s a lesson that shouldn’t be forgotten.

Sen. Collins finally pulls the plug on Cassidy-Graham,"Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) once more spared her party, her state and her country from a legislative debacle. The Post reports: The latest Republican effort to unwind the Affordable Care Act collapsed Monday as a third GOP senator announced her opposition and left the proposal short of the votes needed to pass. While one top Republican senator held out the possibility that the Senate might still vote on the bill, others accepted the reality that the push had sputtered out after Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) joined two of her colleagues in formal opposition. “Everybody knows that’s going to fail,” said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who led a raucous, five-hour hearing on the bill Monday afternoon. “You don’t have one Democrat vote for it. So it’s going to fail.” She slammed the bill’s sponsors Monday night, declaring, “Last night, a whole new bill came out, which to me epitomizes the problem.” In a written statement, she debunked the false claims its proponents had made: First, both proposals [the original and amended Cassidy-Graham] make sweeping changes and cuts in the Medicaid program. Expert projections show that more than $1 trillion would be taken out of the Medicaid program between the years 2020 and 2036. This would have a devastating impact to a program that has been on the books for 50 years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled children and low-income seniors. Second, both bills open the door for states to weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes. Some states could allow higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions, potentially making their insurance unaffordable. States could also limit specific categories of benefits for Affordable Care Act policies, such as eliminating coverage for mental health or substance abuse treatment. Third, physicians, patient advocates, insurers, and hospitals agree that both versions of this legislation would lead to higher premiums and reduced coverage for tens of millions of Americans. Her decision capped an embarrassing day for the Republicans. It’s not clear which was worse for the GOP on Monday — the sight of audience members with disabilities being hauled out of the one and only hearing on the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill or the economic impact described by those crazy kids over at S&P; Global Ratings (no left-wing group). S&P found: Lower level of insured initially in the 133%-400% of federal poverty line (FPL) … [and] gradually over the longer term in the traditional Medicaid ranks as some states are unable to maintain current eligibility levels with a lower share of Medicaid federal funding. … 580,000 lost jobs and $240 billion in lost economic activity by 2027, ensuring that the GDP growth remains stuck in low gear of around 2% at best in the next decade. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) did not help his cause. A sticking point has been the dissembling by the bill’s authors about protection for those with preexisting conditions. The latest version didn’t even require the states to apply for a waiver to lift that Obamacare protection — merely that they represent that such people will have “adequate and affordable” care. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) asked Cassidy during the only hearing from the bill whether there was a definition of “adequate and affordable in this bill.” Cassidy snidely replied that there were dictionary definitions. If was not clear whether he understood that his job was to persuade senators to vote for the bill. More than any specific facet of the bill, the most striking aspects of the undertaking have been the utter cynicism and recklessness with which the bill’s sponsors have proceeded. We are talking about health care for hundreds of millions of Americans. (Even those who get insurance through their employer may lose protection for preexisting conditions.) However, the bill’s authors could not even explain its fundamental provisions, provide credible numbers or wait for a proper scoring.

Morning Bits,"The administration wants to avoid definitive rules that travel ban opponents can litigate. “The new restrictions will not apply to existing visa holders, legal permanent residents or people who work with the U.S. government. Waivers can be granted on a case-by-case basis if denying entry would cause the foreign national ‘undue hardship’ and if it does not pose a threat to the national security. The directive says that waivers could apply to visitors if they were already admitted to work or study in the U.S., if they have significant business or professional obligations in the country, if they want to visit a spouse, child or parent, or if they have an infant or child who needs urgent medical care.” Republicans dodge the issue voters most care about. “ Americans think Congress’s No. 1 priority for the rest of this year should be combating high prescription drug prices, according to the latest POLITICO-Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health poll. Forty percent of Americans want lawmakers to focus on bringing down pharmaceutical costs — more than any other issue surveyed. The bully in chief will duck a fight with LeBron James. “[T]hat guy…continues to try to divide us as people. And like I said on one of my social media platforms a couple days ago, the thing that kind of frustrated me and pissed me off a little bit is the fact that he’s now — he used sport, he used the sports platform to try to divide us. . . . [W]e have to figure out a way how we come together and be as great as we can be as a people. Because the people run this country, not one individual. And damn sure not him.” Trump can only punch down. Trump should steer clear of any more “Lock her up!” chants. “Ivanka Trump, the first daughter and adviser to the president, used a personal email address to communicate with a government official after her father took office, according to documents that the nonprofit American Oversight obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and shared exclusively with Newsweek.” Other retailers will find it hard to sidestep upward wage pressure. “Target said it is raising its minimum wage to $11 an hour starting next month and to $15 an hour within three years, as the retailer competes to fill low-wage jobs in a tighter labor market. The retailer, which employs about 323,000 people, said the new rate will apply to current staff as well as 100,000 temporary workers it plans to hire for the holidays.” Conservative Peter Wehner does not evade the issue. “Of course it’s about race. That’s not all it’s about, and there is an element for sure about the national anthem. But Donald Trump’s political career has been laced with appeals to race. Some of them have been blatant and some of them have been sub-textual, but they have always been there, and he has divided the country along racial lines. And I do think it’s a fair critique to say that he couldn’t summon moral outrage after the events in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the neo-Nazis and the white supremacists were marching and he was insistent on trying to say, ‘Well, there were good people marching with them’ when there weren’t.” Maybe Republicans should stop trying to defend him? Trump short-circuits a possible negative ruling by changing his ban. “The Supreme Court has postponed for now a hearing on President Trump’s power to ban immigrants from certain countries while it considers whether a new order issued Sunday night makes the case moot. In an order issued Monday, the justices asked for new briefs about whether the third rendition of the travel ban means there is nothing left for the court to decide.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The Daily 202: Trump’s plutocracy problem complicates push for tax cuts,"With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Two in three Americans believe that large corporations pay too little in taxes. Only 11 percent of U.S. adults think these businesses pay too much, while 17 percent think they pay their fair share. Even half of Republicans believe big businesses pay too little in taxes, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Overwhelmingly, across party lines, people feel that the current tax system is rigged in favor of the wealthy. Over 7 in 10 Americans think the tax system favors the rich. Just five percent think the current code favors the middle class. But the more details that leak out about President Trump’s plan, the clearer it becomes that the wealthiest are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries. Top White House negotiators and key GOP leaders have reportedly agreed on two targets: lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent and cutting the top income tax rate — for those who make more than $418,000 a year — from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. -- Trump is scheduled to fly to Indiana tomorrow to unveil details of the proposal after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations. It’s unclear how specific he will be, and people involved in the process say that much remains fluid, but White House aides insist that selling these cuts will be the president’s top priority in the coming months. -- The new Post-ABC poll shows that Trump is starting in a hole. Before our pollsters asked about any specifics, respondents were asked generally to react to Trump’s tax plan “given what you’ve heard or read”: 28 percent support it, and 44 percent oppose it. The rest — 34 percent — have no opinion yet. A majority of the country, 51 percent, thinks Trump’s plan will mainly help the wealthy. Just 10 percent think it will mainly help the middle class. A quarter of the country thinks the Trump tax plan will help both groups equally, and the rest are undecided. There is also intensity against Trump: 15 percent said they support Trump’s plan strongly while 33 oppose it strongly. Only 60 percent of Republicans support the plan right now. Overall, 35 percent of all men support Trump on taxes but just 22 percent of women do. When asked specifically whether income taxes paid by businesses should be reduced, the country is split about evenly: 45 percent support and 48 percent oppose corporate tax cuts. -- The poll makes clear that the administration will win the tax fight if it can successfully represent the plan as primarily about cutting taxes for middle- and lower- income people. In the survey, 78 percent support such cuts — including majorities in both parties. Just 19 percent oppose reducing income taxes paid by middle- and lower-income people. Our Damian Paletta reports that Republican leaders, aware the current draft of the plan could be construed as a huge giveaway to the wealthy, are still trying to design some features to the package that would ensure that the rich don't get too large a share of the benefits: “As it stands, the tax cut is expected to add at least $1 trillion to the debt, and potentially much more. … Republicans plan to push for collapsing the seven income tax rates to three new brackets … External estimates, based on initial reports of the plan and not full details, found that it would cut taxes by $5.5 trillion over 10 years.” -- Trump also understands the optics. Instead of tinkering with the substance, he has flatly insisted that his plan will not benefit the rich. “The people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed,” the president insisted this summer. Speaking to reporters at the White House two weeks ago, Trump insisted that the proposal is “not a plan for the rich” and might even raise their taxes. “I think the wealthy will be pretty much where they are,” he said. “If they have to go higher, they’ll go higher.” But most tax experts agree the rich, in fact, are likely to benefit bigly. In March, based on a preliminary framework released by the Treasury Department, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that half of all the benefits from Trump’s plan would go to the richest 1 percent. The study found that the richest 1 percent would receive — on average — a $175,000 tax cut. Moderate-income households would save only $760. -- This is part of a pattern: Trump campaigns like a populist. He governs like a plutocrat. The dichotomy between what the president promises his tax plan will do and what’s he’s likely to unveil on Wednesday is just the latest example of the president’s actions not backing up his rhetoric. As a candidate, Trump said hedge fund managers weren’t supporting his campaign because they were “getting away with murder” when it came to avoiding taxes. He said he would stop them and argued during the debates that he was well suited to close loopholes in the tax code because he had taken advantage of them. Then, as president-elect, he was caught on a cellphone camera reassuring patrons at one of Manhattan’s poshest restaurants. “We’ll get your taxes down, don’t worry about it,” he said at the 21 Club. -- With the Trump administration, always watch what they do — not what they say. After Steven Mnuchin was named treasury secretary, he made a very specific declaration on CNBC that rattled the markets: “Any reductions we have in upper income taxes will be offset by less deductions, so that there will be no … absolute tax cut for the upper class.” Jake Tapper asked him about this Sunday on CNN, and Mnuchin walked it back. “I did say that,” he said. “I just want to clarify. It was never a promise. It was never a pledge.” President Trump and Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) step off Air Force One after arriving in Huntsville, Ala., last Friday. (Evan Vucci/AP) -- One of official Washington’s favorite parlor games over the past few days has been speculating about what exactly Trump is trying to distract people from by launching a culture war against the NFL over the national anthem. Is he trying to get us to pay less attention to the fact that his favored candidate is probably going to lose today in Alabama? Is he trying to divert us from the impending failure of the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill that he pushed hard for last week? Or the worsening humanitarian crisis and the botched federal response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico? Could it be the hypocrisy of Jared Kushner using personal email for official government business at the same time his father-in-law attacked Hillary Clinton for doing the same thing? Maybe, though, Trump wants limited media scrutiny of the specifics of his tax plan. Perhaps he does not want his core supporters to feel like they’ve been had? Folks in the Rust Belt and Sun Belt have repeatedly proved willing to vote against their economic self-interest when they are focused on cultural concerns, whether opposing gay rights to supporting gun rights. Maybe that’s what going after Colin Kaepernick is really about. -- One of the biggest challenges for D.C. Republicans right now is that they lack credible messengers to persuade people that their tax plan is not a sop to the wealthiest 1 percent. Their argument is that cutting taxes on rich individuals and big businesses will boost economic growth, prevent companies from relocating overseas and eventually trickle down into higher wages for workers. Trump’s approval rating is 39 percent, with 57 percent disapproval. This makes it hard to scare Democratic senators from red states into backing him up. As the first president since Richard Nixon to refuse to release his tax returns, we don’t have any idea how much the self-proclaimed billionaire will personally benefit from his own plan. Trump has also given no indication that he has the self-discipline to make a sustained or substantive case for massive corporate tax cuts. Paul Ryan’s approval rating is 31 percent nationally. Among Republicans, just 53 percent think the Speaker of the House is doing a good job. We didn’t ask about Mitch McConnell in our latest poll, but other surveys have shown that the Senate majority leader’s image is even more underwater among rank-and-file Republicans than Ryan’s. Both are members of the “Big Six” that negotiated this tax plan in secret over the past several months. Outside of the GOP donor community, very few people know the two other lawmakers: House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady and Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch. Mnuchin, who wants to be the biggest cheerleader for the plan, is poorly positioned on the issue. The former Goldman Sachs banker, whose net worth is somewhere around $300 million, was badly compromised by the revelation that he requested a military jet to travel to Europe for his honeymoon. The treasury secretary did take a government aircraft to Kentucky last month on a trip that was nominally about promoting the Trump tax plan. He also viewed the solar eclipse from the top of Fort Knox, which was very near the path of totality. Facing scrutiny, Mnuchin made matters worse by pretending he wasn’t really that into it. “People in Kentucky took this stuff very seriously,” he said dismissively. “Being a New Yorker, I don’t have any interest in watching the eclipse.” Mnuchin’s wife, the actress Louise Linton, drew comparisons to Marie Antoinette in recent weeks. Joining him at Fort Knox, the nation’s repository of gold, she posted an Instagram photo of herself deplaning and tagged designers like Hermes and Valentino that most Americans cannot afford to buy from. She then attacked an online user who was offended that taxpayers paid for the junket. Linton later apologized — but she did so while wearing a designer ball gown on the cover of Washington Life magazine. -- Another reason it’s hard for the administration to make the case: Neither history nor the smartest experts are on their side. “Without major changes, this deal is looking more and more like traditional ‘supply side economics,’ the theory that tax cuts for the top help everyone else, because the wealthy supposedly turn around and spend and invest more,” Heather Long explained in an analysis published yesterday afternoon on Wonkblog. “After decades of stagnating wages (especially for men) and rising inequality, Americans are growing skeptical of this approach. It didn’t work in Kansas, and most economists predict few economic gains from this latest attempt. … Goldman Sachs put out a report last week saying the tax plan would only add 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent to America’s economy in 2018 and 2019, far less than the extra point of growth the White House has been predicting. The National Association for Business Economics, a group that tends to lean to the right, has a similar prediction: Only 0.25 percent extra growth in 2018 from Trump’s tax package … “Just about everyone agree something needs to be done to stop U.S. companies from going relocating overseas to lower their tax bills,” Heather adds. “But it’s questionable whether slashing corporate tax rates will actually spur companies to use the extra cash on hand to pay workers more. That didn’t happen after the 1986 tax revision under President Ronald Reagan. Weekly wages for rank and file types (non-managers) barely budged in the years that followed, according to data from the Labor Department.” WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:  Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner talk before a joint news conference at the White House. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) THE EMAIL SAGA CONTINUES … -- One day after news surfaced that Jared Kushner used a private email account to sporadically conduct White House business, the New York Times reports that at least six of Trump’s closest advisers have done the same. Matt Apuzzo and Maggie Haberman write: “Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist, and Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff, also occasionally used private email addresses. Other advisers, including Gary D. Cohn and Stephen Miller, sent or received at least a few emails on personal accounts, officials said. Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, who is married to Mr. Kushner, used a private account when she acted as an unpaid adviser in the first months of the administration, Newsweek reported Monday. Administration officials acknowledged that she also occasionally did so when she formally became a White House adviser. … “While the private email accounts spurred accusations of hypocrisy from Democrats, there are differences. Mrs. Clinton stored classified information on a private server, and she exclusively used a private account for her government work, sending or receiving tens of thousands of emails. The content and frequency of the Trump advisers’ emails remain unknown, but Trump administration officials described the use of personal accounts as sporadic.” The private email addresses have the potential to complicate special counsel Robert Mueller’s search for documents related to his Russia investigation. -- House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) joined Democrats Monday in demanding details on any senior Trump officials who have used private emails. Mike DeBonis reports: “The letters, [sent] to White House counsel Don McGahn and the leaders of two dozen federal departments and agencies, demand answers to inquiries about the use of nonofficial email and other messaging accounts[.] … Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the panel, also joined the request. The letters represent some of the most aggressive oversight of the Trump administration from Gowdy, who took over the reins of the Oversight Committee in June … [and] come after the Republicans on the committee repeatedly questioned [Hillary] Clinton’s use of private email … during her tenure as secretary of state.” Jared Kushner destroyed the Rose Law firm billing records and fired the White House travel office staff. And this: A few emails on your personal account is really no big deal, but after the campaign they ran, it’s quite the combo of arrogance & stupidity. It will be more than 6. This just in: everyone in govt has done this, the GOP campaign was completely disingenuous, & too many fell for it. https://t.co/4deOfi2zRE GET SMART FAST:​​ The Trump administration is under pressure to ramp up its recovery efforts in Puerto Rico.

(Joel Achenbach, Dan Lamothe and Alex Horton) Nearly 17,000 registered voters in Wisconsin were kept from the polls in 2016 because of the state’s strict voter ID law, according to a new study from the University of Wisconsin. The findings are sure to fuel an already heated debate over Trump’s narrow victory in the state. (New York Times) Republican senators unveiled a new proposal to allow “dreamers” a pathway to legalization, but the measure bars the young undocumented immigrants from sponsoring family members.

(Politico) The Homeland Security Department intends to collect the social media information of all immigrants — including naturalized citizens and permanent residents. DHS published a new rule in the Federal Register last week in which it stated it would include by Oct. 18 in people’s immigration files “social media handles, aliases, associated identifiable information, and search results.” (Buzzfeed News) More than 430,000 Rohingya have fled from Burma to neighboring Bangladesh in the past month, seeking escape from a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing” led by the Burmese military.

REPUBLICANS FAIL ON HEALTH CARE — AGAIN: -- Susan Collins became the third Republican senator to announce opposition to the Cassidy-Graham bill — effectively killing the last-ditch attempt to roll back Obamacare. Sean Sullivan, Juliet Eilperin and Kelsey Snell report: “Collins [R-Maine] announced that she could not back the measure … moments after the release of a much-anticipated Congressional Budget Office analysis that forecast ‘millions’ of Americans would lose coverage by 2026 if the bill was enacted. Two GOP senators — Rand Paul (Ky.) and John McCain (Ariz.) — had already come out against the bill and were not swayed by a new draft that emerged Monday morning. … A fourth Republican, Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), indicated through his aides Monday that he could not back the bill in its current form because it would not go far enough in repealing the 2010 law. “Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) did not rule out the possibility of holding a vote on the proposal despite clear signs that it did not have sufficient support to pass. … Speaking on the Senate floor Monday, McConnell thanked Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), the bill’s authors, but suggested that their work had stalled out.” -- The CBO reported the legislation would result in a loss of $1 trillion in Medicaid spending by 2026 and reduce the federal deficit by at least $133 billion. (Amy Goldstein) -- Paul Kane writes in his latest column that Cassidy-Graham was “bad news, start to finish, with little chance of success — and little in the way of true legislative scrutiny. … [T]he Senate has barely followed anything resembling a normal process as it considers a bill that would overhaul an industry that represents one-sixth of the national economy. At least partly as a result of that, the [legislation] was left for dead before the Finance Committee hearing had even ended. … The process of making legislative sausage on Capitol Hill has never been pretty, but the effort to repeal the ACA has stretched the limits of congressional norms — and given lawmakers hesitant to support the controversial GOP health-care proposal an excuse to back away.” -- The bill had a dramatic demise, as hundreds of protesters lined up for the only public hearing on the legislation to defend Obamacare. David Weigel reports: “As they filled the halls, senators’ social media teams shared videos of them talking about their personal coverage or even getting arrested; Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.), the [Senate Finance] committee’s ranking Democrat, personally delivered pizzas to the people who had been lining up since early morning.” -- U.S. Capitol Police reported that more than 180 protesters were arrested as a result of the demonstrations. (Martin Weil) -- The show must go on: in the form of a CNN debate between Cassidy and his partner in the legislative push, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But the faceoff focused more on the future. David Weigel reports: “The four senators represented three approaches, with Klobuchar — one of 31 Senate Democrats who declined to co-sponsor Sanders’s [single-payer] health-care bill — arguing for a return to bipartisanship. … Klobuchar and Sanders stayed united to rip apart Cassidy-Graham, quoting from Congressional Budget Office studies and medical industry statements to portray the Republican bill as radical and unworkable. … Cassidy and Graham, both of whom had defended their bill in the Senate Finance Committee, stuck to their workshopped arguments.” -- BUT, BUT, BUT: Senate Republicans are already looking at ways to keep the health-care push alive by keeping open a special budget process that allows them to consider legislation on a party-line vote.  Politico’s Seung Min Kim, Jennifer Haberkorn and Burgess Everett report: “Republicans could provide reconciliation instructions for both health care and tax reform in the fiscal 2018 budget resolution that Congress must pass to again unlock the fast-track procedural powers. That might entail some procedural hurdles, but one GOP aide said Monday that because the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over about 95 percent of health care policy, ‘it’s not like we couldn’t slip it in anyway.’ “Alternatively, Republicans could reserve the fiscal 2018 budget for tax reform as planned, but then take up a budget for fiscal 2019 early next year and write reconciliation instructions that addresses Obamacare repeal in that resolution, according to GOP sources. Doing so would put the contentious issue of health care back in the spotlight during the 2018 midterm elections. … McConnell is skeptical of the plan to combine Obamacare repeal and tax reform in next year’s budget[.]” -- The GOP health-care push is indicative of a trend in Trump's world: Blue states would get hit hard by legislative and executive branch actions while red states would be comparatively spared. John Wagner reports: “Fourteen of the 15 states that would benefit [from Cassidy-Graham] were won by Trump, while 11 of the biggest 15 losers are states he lost. … Blue states would also take a disproportionate hit under a prominent provision in Trump’s tax plan. The vast majority of ‘sanctuary cities’ threatened with loss of federal funding are in Democratic-leaning states … [and the] administration has signaled its intent to significantly scale back mass transit funding traditionally favored by more liberal and urban states. ‘What we’re witnessing is war between the red and the blue,’ said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ‘This is hardball, and it’s distinctive from what we’ve seen before.’” The Dallas Cowboys, led by owner Jerry Jones, center, take a knee prior to the national anthem before to an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals. (Matt York/AP) A DIVIDED AMERICA: -- The debate over the national anthem continued on and off the NFL field last night, with the Dallas Cowboys kneeling before the song played prior to their game against Arizona. Des Bieler and Mark Maske report: “[Cowboys owner Jerry] Jones, Coach Jason Garrett and other Cowboys coaches and front office executives locked arms while standing on the field. Before the anthem, Jones and the players and coaches took a knee. They then stood up, with arms still interlocked, for the anthem. Some in the crowd at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., where the Cowboys were taking on the host Cardinals, booed at the display. Arizona players also stood and linked arms during the anthem, but they did not take a knee beforehand.” Trump tweeted again about the issue this morning: The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country! -- The Post's new national political reporter Michael Scherer writes that, although Trump made similar attacks on the NFL during his campaign, they never attracted this level of backlash: “Trump attacked an enormously popular sport whose fans prefer it to be a politics-free arena, while once again touching on the raw nerve of race. In so doing, the president proved anew that divisive provocations can mean something completely different when they come not from a private citizen, but the man whose very job description is to lead the country. … Trump’s political strategy appears to be following the logic of other national firestorms he has prompted: take a stand for a position that brings into clear relief the divide between himself and those who he describes as unpatriotic elites. He uses the controversy to dominate the news cycle, position himself as a strong leader and demonstrate that he is fighting for regular working Americans nostalgic for an earlier time in the country’s history.” -- When White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked by a reporter why the president was devoting so much political oxygen to the NFL, Sanders responded, “Well, that’s determined by you guys.” Callum Borchers writes: “Technically, Sanders is right. Reporters could, in theory, have ignored the subject about which the president of the United States displayed the most interest over the previous three days. That is, of course, a totally unreasonable expectation. You have to hand it to the White House, though: This is a pretty neat trick. Let the president talk for days about demonstrations at NFL games, then claim the protests are the media's obsession when reporters ask lots of questions.” -- But even a “Fox and Friends” host thought Trump went too far with his remarks. The Daily Beast’s Matt Wilstein reports: “‘When you have Robert Kraft coming out against you, you know you’ve gone too far,’ [host Brian] Kilmeade added, referencing the Trump-supporting New England Patriots owner who denounced the president’s ‘divisive’ comments in a statement on Sunday. ‘He made things immeasurably worse by speaking out,’ he added. ‘And I know what the intention was, but the language used, it was galvanizing in the wrong direction.’ ‘Well, Brian, he is the voice for a lot of people out there,’ co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, jumping in quickly to clean up after Kilmeade. “A lot of people agree with him and are scared to give their opinions.” -- Trump also hit back against a CNN story reporting that his top aide John Kelly was frustrated by the president’s decision to speak out on the issue. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins and Jeff Zeleny report: “In a brief interview Monday evening, Kelly told CNN he is ‘appalled’ by what he sees as a lack of respect for the flag and national anthem. ‘I believe every American, when the national anthem is played, should cover their hearts and think about all the men and women who have been maimed and killed,’ Kelly said. ‘Every American should stand up and think for three lousy minutes.’ His son, Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010.” .@CNN is #FakeNews. Just reported COS (John Kelly) was opposed to my stance on NFL players disrespecting FLAG, ANTHEM, COUNTRY. Total lie! General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY! NORTH KOREA'S GROWING THREAT: -- North Korea’s foreign minister asserted Monday that Trump’s recent remarks at the U.N. amounted to a “declaration of war,” telling reporters that Pyongyang now has “every right” to shoot down U.S. bombers. Carol Morello reports: “'The whole world should clearly remember it was the U.S. who first declared war on our country,’ [Ri Yong Ho] said. ‘Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country.’ Ri’s remarks were the most direct and threatening so far since Trump … threatened to ‘totally destroy’ North Korea [last week].” Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday the United States has not declared war on North Korea, rejecting Ri’s assertion as “absurd.” “'Our goal is still the same,” she [said] … 'We continue to seek the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. That’s our focus, doing that through both the most maximum economic and diplomatic pressures as possible at this point.'” THE TRAVEL BAN BATTLE: -- The Supreme Court on Monday postponed a hearing on a previous version of Trump’s travel ban, with justices asking for briefs on whether the case was now moot. Robert Barnes and Devlin Barrett report: “In an order issued Monday, the justices asked for new briefs about whether the third rendition of the travel ban means there is nothing left for the court to decide. The briefs are due Oct. 5 and the court said for now it is removing from its oral argument calendar a hearing scheduled for Oct. 10.” -- Trump’s latest ban could affect tens of thousands of visa applicants, according to a Post review of State Department data. Matt Zapotosky, Robert Barnes and Devlin Barrett report: “The newest ban is in some ways even more expansive than the last[.] … But unlike the last ban, the restrictions vary from place to place, and countries that increase their cooperation and information-sharing with the United States might be able to find their way off the list. … Administration officials can now point to Venezuela and North Korea as being non-Muslim majority countries on the banned list … But ban opponents note that the restrictions on Venezuela affect only government officials and that few people from North Korea travel to the United States[.] … A Post review of State Department data found that more than 65,000 visas were issued in fiscal 2016 that would now likely fall under the ban.” -- Trump’s decision to extend the ban to North Korea is “mostly symbolic,” experts said, since most average resident cannot come to the United States anyway. Emily Rauhala reports: “Although North Korean diplomats do travel to the United States, mostly to United Nations headquarters in New York, the order notes that diplomatic visits are exempt from the ban. That only leaves the handful of officials or academics who attend conferences in the United States each year, a group that is already closely vetted by the State Department. ‘They should have checked if there is North Korean immigration before they banned it,’ said John Delury, [a professor in Seoul]. ‘Why are you banning something that doesn’t exist?’” THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Russian operatives used thousands of targeted Facebook ads during the 2016 election to exploit  U.S. racial and religious divisions, highlighting the sophistication of Moscow’s influence campaign. Some ads sought to promote groups like Black Lives Matters, while others highlighted Hillary Clinton's support from Muslim women. Adam Entous, Craig Timberg and Elizabeth Dwoskin report: “The Russian campaign — taking advantage of Facebook’s ability to send contrary messages to different groups of users based on their political and demographic characteristics — also sought to sow discord among religious groups. … These targeted messages, along with others that have surfaced in recent days, highlight the sophistication of an influence campaign slickly crafted to mimic and infiltrate U.S. political discourse while also seeking to heighten tensions between groups already wary of one another. “The previously undisclosed ads suggest that the operatives worked off evolving lists of racial, religious, political and economic themes. They used these to create pages, write posts and craft ads that would appear in users’ news feeds — with the apparent goal of appealing to one audience and alienating another. In some cases, the pages even advertised events. The nature and detail of these ads have troubled investigators at Facebook, on Capitol Hill and at the Justice Department …” Roger Stone in the documentary “Get Me Roger Stone.” (Netflix) -- Roger Stone will testify today before the House Intelligence Committee, where he will fiercely deny that he had any contact — much less colluded — with Russia during the election, according to his opening remarks. Karoun Demirjian and Tom Hamburger report: “Stone also plans to deny that he had any advance knowledge that [John Podesta’s emails would be hacked and] released by WikiLeaks — despite tweeting just days before that Podesta’s ‘time in the barrel’ would soon be coming. In his prepared opening statement, Stone decries the nation’s intelligence agencies as ‘politicized,’ and questions the findings of the intelligence community regarding Russia’s efforts to meddle in the 2016 election[:] ‘Mantra-like repetition of the claim by our vaunted 17 intelligence agencies that the ‘Russians’ colluded with the Trump campaign about Russia’s efforts to sway the election, does not make it so,' he wrote.” -- The Trump administration is stonewalling Capitol Hill requests for documents related to Russia. Missed deadlines have prompted some committee members to threaten the West Wing and Justice Department with subpoenas. CNN’s Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb report: “[The] three congressional committees … have asked for scores of documents related to everything from Jared Kushner's security clearance to records surrounding [Trump's] discussions with James Comey[.] … At the same time, the GOP leader of the House intelligence committee is threatening to hold a public hearing this week over documents the Justice Department has so far failed to turn over to Capitol Hill regarding the FBI's ties to a British operative who compiled a dossier of allegations on Trump's connections with Russia. “And the GOP-led Senate judiciary committee is in a growing standoff with the Justice Department's deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, over several issues, including the department's decision to prevent two senior FBI officials from sitting down for transcribed interviews on Capitol Hill to provide eyewitness accounts of the Comey firing.” Steve Bannon tours the Ames Companies Inc., with the president in Harrisburg, Pa back in April. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) -- Days before he took over as Trump’s campaign manager, former Breitbart editor Steve Bannon sought to “infiltrate” Facebook hiring efforts by planting a mole inside the company. BuzzFeed News’s Joseph Bernstein reports: “The email exchange with a conservative Washington operative reveals the importance that the giant tech platform — now reeling from its role in the 2016 election — held for one of the campaign’s central figures. And it also shows the lengths to which the brawling new American right is willing to go to keep tabs on and gain leverage over the Silicon Valley giants it used to help elect Trump — but whose executives it also sees as part of the globalist enemy. The idea to infiltrate Facebook came to Bannon from Chris Gacek, a former congressional staffer who is now an official at the Family Research Council, which lobbies against abortion and many LGBT rights. Here's what happened: Gaeck emailed Bannon saying there was a posting for D.C.-based manager that seemed perfect for Breitbart to 'flood the zone” with applicants. “'Can u get on this"
Protests fill Senate hallways as Cassidy-Graham gets its hearing,"In July, 56-year-old Joe Smith trekked 22 hours from his Harrison, Ark., home to protest the Senate Republicans’ attempt to repeal part of the Affordable Care Act. Thinking the fight was over, Smith went home. On Monday morning — after another 22-hour car and bus ride — Smith was back at the Senate, joining hundreds of protesters lined up outside the Senate Finance Committee’s hearing on Cassidy-Graham. “We can’t afford to lose our health care,” said Smith, who suffers from cerebral palsy, gets disability benefits and has insurance through Aetna. “Every time we go up here, I think it makes a difference. I personally think they shouldn’t do away with Obamacare, and I think they should fix it, so I’m here.” This is wild: Hundreds of people are in line for the Graham-Cassidy Hearing at 2pm. It snakes from Dirksen Senate Office Building into Hart: pic.twitter.com/8nFFRImCsd Since the return of the GOP’s repeal push last week, activists from a constellation of progressive groups had planned days of action Saturday (when most people would be off work) and Monday (when the Senate returned). Just as they’d done ahead of the other repeal votes, activists focused less on massive rallies then on targeted action in the spaces where senators would be. On Monday morning, that meant a massive, snaking line of activists outside of the Hart Senate Office Building location of the Cassidy-Graham bill’s only public hearing. The Center for Public Democracy organized some of it, but there was no one strategy once the halls were full. Some, like Smith, wanted to be seen, then head to the hearing’s overflow room. Some were there to get arrested. #ADAPTandRESIST ppl here since 4am for #GrahamCassidy hearing blocked by line of #DC #Capitol police #disabled #disability pic.twitter.com/JF2ZakWgc6 Democrats, whose relationships with the protest groups have strengthened since the start of the year, encouraged them to get active ahead of the Sept. 30 repeal deadline. As they filled the halls, senators’ social media teams shared videos of them talking about their personal coverage or even getting arrested; Sen.

Just when you think Republicans can't get more irresponsible ...,"If you thought it absurd and incredibly irresponsible for Republicans to propose last week a slipshod, radical health-care bill that would not even allow for a Congressional Budget Office score, then the Sunday night amendments cooked up by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) will infuriate you. The timing alone should be enough to stop the bill. Reworking one-sixth of the economy before the only hearing on the subject — and without time for senators to digest a fraction of the numbers — bespeaks desperation on the sponsors’ part. They don’t have “momentum” and aren’t just about to snag 50 votes; if they were, they wouldn’t resort to last-minute shenanigans. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another “no” vote, reportedly wasn’t swayed by the new numbers. The changes are akin to pouring old wine into slightly different bottles, or rather, filling a few states to the brim while snoozing senators get far less than their outspoken colleagues. The Post reports: If you read the updated bill, which was leaked Sunday night to The Washington Post and other news outlets, it’s pretty clear which senators Cassidy and Graham are playing to. A state-by-state summary claims Alaska would get 3 percent more funding, Arizona would get 15 percent more funding and Maine would get 43 percent more funding from 2020 and 2026 compared to current law. Senators from all three of those states — Lisa Murkowski, John McCain and Susan Collins — had backed away from the bill in recent days. McCain indicated on Friday he’d oppose the bill because it wasn’t going through regular order, while Collins and Murkowski said they want to better understand how it would affect their own states. … The state funding estimates don’t take into consideration the bill’s additional cuts to regular Medicaid spending. If those cuts were considered, it would be clear that states like Alaska and West Virginia would still be losing out on federal funds overall. [Emphasis added.] In short, if the sponsors are trying to bribe Alaska’s and Maine’s senators, they haven’t done a very good job of it. Outside analysts note that the Cassidy-Graham numbers themselves show an overall loss to the states. For example, Alaska would receive $99 million less under the block grant; Ohio would receive $1.6 billion less under the block grant; West Virginia would receive $477 million less under the block grant. And if that were not enough, Axios picked up on some mathematical chicanery in the Cassidy-Graham numbers: “They also add state savings to the block grants under the bill, but don’t include them in the current law baseline, meaning the comparison isn’t apples to apples.” Aside from the math, the newest iteration of Cassidy-Graham makes crystal clear that the federal safeguards against charging more for people with preexisting conditions are gone. Timothy Jost explains: As in the earlier version, a state must describe in its funding application “how the State shall maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions.” As with the earlier draft, however, the consumer protections that the bill does allow states to permit insurers to waive makes protection for people with preexisting conditions very tenuous. A state must also certify that it will ensure compliance with the ACA requirement that insurers and health plans cover adult children up to age 26 and several pre-ACA insurance reform requirements—minimum hospital maternity stays, coverage of reconstructive surgery following mastectomies; mental health parity, and protection of genetic information. States can waive Obamacare restrictions that currently prevent states from “allowing insurers to vary [premiums] for coverage” (except on the basis of sex or genetic information); offering coverage that doesn’t meet the Obamacare minimum standards; and using multiple risk pools (which quickly price sicker people out of the health-care market). Jost finds that states therefore will be able to ignore the ACA’s “essential health benefit requirements, actuarial value and metal level requirements; out-of-pocket limit requirements; requirement that insurers offer child-only plans, requirement that insurers cover preventive services without cost sharing, single risk pool requirement, and age and area rating requirements.” If Collins, Murkowski and other moderates had qualms about the first version, they’ll likely be doubly concerned by what they spot in the latest offering. And other senators (Hello, Ohio! Wake up, West Virginia!) may wonder why they didn’t get anything. Cassidy managed to slip in extra funding for his state. The question now is becoming not whether a senator or two will be persuaded, but how any senator in good conscience votes for this mess.

Trump and Trumpcare drag down the GOP,"President Trump’s full impact on the fortunes of the Republican Party will get tested in the GOP midterms in 2018. Judging by his impact so far, however, he has been the Democrats’ best ally, and not simply because he made deals with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). The Post-ABC News poll reports that 69 percent of Americans and 73 percent of registered voters disapprove of the way Republicans in Congress are performing. Sixty-nine percent of independents disapprove, as do 56 percent of Republicans. In a worrisome sign for 2018, older voters — who vote more regularly than younger voters — disapprove slightly more than do younger voters (70 percent of those aged 50 to 64 disapprove, while 75 percent of those 65 and older do). House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) registers 54 percent disapproval from registered voters, with only 34 percent approval. CNN likewise reports, “Fewer than three in 10 Americans — 29% — hold a favorable view of the Republican Party according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. That is down 13 percentage points from March and is the lowest mark for the GOP since CNN began asking the question in 1992.” In addition, “Just 39% of Republicans approve of the job GOP leaders are doing. House Speaker Paul Ryan’s favorability has dipped to 32%, a six-point drop since April, while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stands at 20% favorability, a seven-point dip since spring.” That translates to lousy numbers, for now, in advance of the midterms: Nearly a quarter of Democrats — 24 % — say they are extremely enthusiastic about voting next year, with another 20% saying they are very enthusiastic. Just 14% of Republicans say they are extremely enthusiastic, with another 20% saying they are very enthusiastic about voting. Democrats also lead in the generic congressional ballot among all Americans by nine percentage points, 50% to 41%, though the midterm electorate traditionally leans more Republican. You can understand why Republicans are held in such disrepute. Democrats and #NeverTrump Republicans see them as enablers of Trump, albeit incompetent ones. Trump cultists deplore Republicans for not giving Trump whatever he wants. Independents see acrimony, incompetence and hyper-partisanship. Moreover, we’ve not come close to the end of the Russia investigation, which delivers daily new evidence of Russian tampering with our election, Trump associates’ contacts with Russian officials and the president’s abuse of his powers to protect himself. In some instances, one can only laugh at the hypocrisy of a president who excoriated his predecessor and his campaign opponent as virtual criminals. (The Post reports: “President Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has used a private email account to conduct and discuss official White House business dozens of times, his lawyer confirmed Sunday.” Didn’t Trump have a chant about that sort of thing?) Meanwhile, most House Republicans remain devoted to running interference for the president. Republicans have made things infinitely worse for themselves by returning again and again to a losing effort on health care. Each time they try and fail, Democrats are reminded how fixated they are on slashing Medicaid; Trumpkins are reminded how unwilling to cooperate with Trump they are. Regardless of party, voters’  jaws drop at the haphazard process, indifference to facts and inability even to defend their own proposals. Seeing Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) flounder as they were pressed on the lack of guaranteed, affordable coverage for those with preexisting conditions would convince most alert voters that these people have no idea what they are doing. Martha Raddatz utterly flummoxed Cassidy: RADDATZ: Senator Cassidy, let’s get down to this in a little more detail. Senator Graham mentioned Susan Collins. Susan Collins, whose vote you’re trying to get, says she’s reading the fine print and said it doesn’t protect people with preexisting conditions. You had the same argument from Jimmy Kimmel, as you know, because their premiums could be so high that it wouldn’t be affordable. How is this someone who’s going to come around? SEN. BILL CASSIDY (R), LOUISIANA: One, that’s absolutely incorrect. President Trump has said he will not sign a bill which does not protect those with pre-existing conditions. I’m a physician who worked in a public hospital for 25 years caring for those with pre-existing conditions. Our language says that if a state wishes to do something different, as they do something different, they must first establish that those with pre-existing conditions have access to affordable and adequate coverage. Two things more. Affordable — how do you define it, people ask? It means able to afford. Now, contrast that with status quo. If you’re not getting subsidies right now on the exchanges, your premiums, with deductibles, can be $30,000 to $45,000… RADDATZ: And how is that decided, who can afford it? How is that decided? That’s what is missing in the bill. What is adequate and affordable care? That’s what people are complaining about. Cassidy could only answer that’d you’d know “affordable” when you see it. But then White House legislative liaison Marc Short fared even worse on “Fox News Sunday”: CHRIS WALLACE: Marc, isn’t [Jimmy] Kimmel right? . . . SHORT: No, this bill continues to protect preexisting conditions. Bill Cassidy is a doctor. His wife is a doctor. They know how to structure. Bill Cassidy is exactly right. But I want to go back to the point you made about winners and losers in this, because the reality is today, Chris, over 30 percent of ObamaCare dollars go to California and New York. It is not a level playing field. And states — WALLACE: There are 34 states that lose money. SHORT: States with nearly equal population, Florida and Texas, get less than 10 percent. It is not equitable now, so what we’re doing is by — WALLACE: Well, that’s because some states refuse to expand Medicaid and others did, and that was a decision by those states. SHORT: When you actually make it equitable — WALLACE: But the fact is 34 states will lose money. SHORT: No, that is not accurate that 34 lose money. When you actually distribute the dollars actually based upon population, there are states that the ObamaCare already made winners and losers. We are leveling out the playing field. That is not necessarily — that is not in my view is — (CROSSTALK) WALLACE: They get less money than they would have under ObamaCare and the reason that they’re going to get less is because they — it wasn’t that the ObamaCare law chose winners and losers. It was that the states chose. They decided whether to go with Medicaid expansion or not. In an admission they could not defend the bill as drafted and had to further bribe key senators, the sponsors released even more changes on Sunday night. Some additional monies (though not enough to make Alaska whole) were added to try to snare Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and Maine got more, too. (Are senators from West Virginia, Ohio and Nevada so incompetent as to not get their own goodies before voting for a losing bill?) Certainly neither the Congressional Budget Office, whose score is needed for reconciliation, nor U.S. senators will have any time to digest the latest changes to possibly the most embarrassing legislation in Senate history. Schumer issued a scathing statement: Despite an attempt to appear to add money for a select few states, this bill is just as bad for those states and the rest of the states because it still contains a massive cut to Medicaid, and would throw our health insurance system into chaos while raising premiums. It still takes away protections for those with preexisting conditions and further weakens consumer protections. Rather than making haphazard, last-minute changes to a partisan bill that won’t be scored by the CBO in time for a vote, we should resume the bipartisan negotiations between Senators Murray and Alexander. We Democrats remain ready and eager to work with our Republican colleagues to improve our health care system The impression one gets is that news hosts (not to mention late-night hosts) devoting a reasonable amount of time to figuring the bill out know more than its proponents. Such legislative dereliction of duty, including one more set of unscored legislative changes, is precisely why the GOP majorities in both houses are at risk.

McCain shows how pathetic his GOP colleagues are,"At a rally for Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) on Friday night, President Trump claimed Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) decision to vote no on the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill was “an unexpected thing.” If so, Trump is oblivious and his legislative liaisons are rotten at their jobs. McCain’s decision was unexpected only if one hadn’t been paying attention or hadn’t taken him seriously when he nixed the prior version of Trumpcare. In a written statement on Friday, McCain said: As I have repeatedly stressed, health care reform legislation ought to be the product of regular order in the Senate. Committees of jurisdiction should mark up legislation with input from all committee members, and send their bill to the floor for debate and amendment. That is the only way we might achieve bipartisan consensus on lasting reform, without which a policy that affects one-fifth of our economy and every single American family will be subject to reversal with every change of administration and congressional majority. . . . I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will affect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won’t be available by the end of the month, we won’t have reliable answers to any of those questions. The question is not why McCain would vote against the bill under such circumstances but why any responsible Republican would vote for it. In yet another swipe at the Senate majority leader who had short-circuited a bipartisan effort to fix the Affordable Care Act, McCain urged: “Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.” With McCain’s no, a no from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and an almost certain no vote from Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who said she was leaning strongly against the bill, plus a possible no vote from Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) — more on her in a moment — Cassidy-Graham is on life support. As of this writing, it was uncertain whether Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) intended to subject highly vulnerable senators (e.g., Dean Heller of Nevada) to a vote next week, which he almost certainly would lose. The bill has been hammered over the past few days by a bipartisan group of governors, a slew of medical groups, independent health-care analysts and even a conservative duo. Joseph Antos and James Capretta, considered by many to be the most trustworthy conservative health-care gurus around, warned: Graham-Cassidy, like the AHCA and the BCRA, would reduce federal spending below the levels provided by the ACA. The plan also reduces some ACA taxes, but not nearly as much as the previous proposals. The net effect of the plan would likely be a reduction in future federal deficits. Moreover, the shift of federal funding for insurance enrollment toward a block grant, along with the per-person limits on federal financing of Medicaid (indexed to rates of inflation below the expected growth of the program under current law) would produce substantial budgetary savings over the medium and long-term. If enacted, Graham-Cassidy would represent the most far-reaching entitlement reform since perhaps the Social Security amendments of 1983. . . . so there is little doubt that CBO will estimate that the plan would also lead to a large number of people dropping out of insurance enrollment. They criticized the Senate for contemplating a process so obviously unserious and irresponsible. The “Senate needs a detailed estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that allows consistent comparisons with previous reform proposal,” they said. “Although CBO has indicated that it will provide a preliminary estimate, a full cost estimate will not be available before a possible Senate vote during the last week of September.” Things were already looking bleak when McCain finally stepped in. The Post reported: An internal analysis by the Trump administration concludes that 31 states would lose federal money for health coverage under Senate Republicans’ latest effort to abolish much of the Affordable Care Act, with the politically critical state of Alaska facing a 38 percent cut in 2026. The report, produced by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, focuses on the final year of a block grant that states would receive under the Cassidy-Graham legislation. It shows that government funding for such health insurance would be 9 percent lower overall in 2026 under the plan than under current law. Indeed, a bribe-a-thon seemed to be underway late last week to win over Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). This is a much worse bill than the one she voted for, according to multiple outside studies. Moreover, it contains the one-year ban on Planned Parenthood and leaves out the opioid abuse-treatment fund that convinced some members to back the last bill. So what did the sponsors offer? They apparently were willing to allow Alaska to keep Obamacare. Kaiser Family Foundation chief executive and President Drew Altman tells Right Turn,”If Alaska wasn’t worse off under the bill, why would they have to pay them off?” The bill’s authors have denied that there will be cuts, but that is false, as their own offering to Murkowski demonstrates. It was not only Alaska that was going to be worse off but many others, including Ohio and West Virginia. Avalere Health, for example, finds that Alaska would lose $1 billion by 2026 and $2 billion by 2027 and $14 billion between 2020 and 2036. West Virginia would be cut by $1 billion from 2020 to 2026 and by $3 billion from 2020 to 2027. The cliff after 2026 would result in a cut of $2 billion in 2027 alone. From 2020 to 2036, West Virginia would lose $27 billion. Ohio would lose $9 billion from 2020 to 2026 and $19 billion from 2020 to 2027. Between 2020 and 2036, Ohio would lose $161 billion. Likewise in the Manatt Health analysis, Alaska loses $1.160 billion from 2020 to 2026, not including the per capita cap on Medicaid. Manatt shows West Virginia would lose $1.65 billion from 2020 to 2026. That also does not include the per capita cap on Medicaid. Likewise, even without the per capita caps, Ohio loses $297 million from 2020 to 2026. If you prefer the Kaiser Family Foundation numbers, then Alaska loses $275 million  from 2020 to 2026 and $632 million just in 2027. West Virginia would lose $964 million from 2020 to 2026 while Ohio would lose $610 million from 2020 to 2026. How could the sponsors give Murkowski a break and not every other state? Their bill is certainly the most damaging of any GOP version — and its sponsors the least informed (or least honest) when it came to acknowledging what was actually in the bill. McCain is a man of principle, a living legend who stands out in a body of small-minded, feeble lawmakers. For goodness sake, where were Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Shelly Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) to defend their states, which would be horribly damaged if the bill were to pass? Waiting for McCain to save them, I suppose. And why should an esteemed veteran such as Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) crumble like a stale cookie when McConnell told him to halt bipartisan talks? Why would Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who fancies himself an independent-minded intellectual, go along with the rush to embrace awful legislation? Go down the list of Republicans and one must conclude as a group that they are undeserving of the public’s trust and, as future presidential aspirants, they lack the maturity, honesty, independence and intellectual rigor to take on the country’s problems.

Activists plan further resistance — and thank yous — as ACA repeal effort staggers,"IOWA CITY, — Moments into her final town hall of the short September recess, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) asked if her audience had heard the news: Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) had declared his firm opposition to Cassidy-Graham, the GOP’s last attempt at a “repeal and replacement” of the Affordable Care Act. “I’ll be honest, it seems unlikely that we’ll be voting on this,” said Ernst. A crowd of hundreds, in one of the University of Iowa’s largest rooms, roared with applause. But for another hour, Ernst took questions on the future of the ACA, with one questioner demanding she take a position — she had been “leaning yes” on the failing bill. With just eight days to go before Sept. 30, the deadline after which Republicans will lose the ability to pass an ACA replacement with a simple majority, activists working to save the law were markedly cautious. Days of action — Saturday rallies organized by MoveOn, Monday rallies by Indivisible — would continue. So would calls to senators. Having been caught unaware in May and last week, when Republicans revived “Trumpcare,” activists said they would keep pounding until the deadline had passed. There are 142 Indivisible groups in Arizona. Show them some love - they've been fighting for all of us. 👇 https://t.co/TdvxoRpTeB “You don’t want to leave anything to chance,” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn. “If more senators come out in opposition to the bill this week, that makes it less likely that they can credibly come back and support another repeal vote. It needs to be totally clear to them that electoral disaster would come from keeping their horrible campaign promise.” It's going to be down to one or two votes. Get the word out. Flood the phone lines. We can defeat this bill if we rally the American people. https://t.co/PeuArsqKwG The vast protest movement that the left built after 2016 took nearly a week to focus on Cassidy-Graham; before that, many groups had began focusing on pushing a Dream Act through Congress. At a Friday rally with the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, which had been planned before Cassidy-Graham gained momentum, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) thanked McCain for his statement, then encouraged protesters to keep working. “Do everything you can, get the word out all over this country, to tell them that no Republican should vote for this,” he said. Sanders, who was facing some criticism for agreeing to debate the GOP bill’s sponsor on Monday night, benefited from the impression that the bill would fail. But to ensure that failure, activists were planning a two-pronged strategy — continuing to pressure Republicans against backing the bill, and thanking the Republicans who had promised to oppose it. “The events in Arizona are going ahead, but they’re going to be thank-you rallies,” said Wikler. “For everybody else, they can expect a 30-ring circus of protests if they do go ahead and do this.” "
Here’s a list of medical groups opposing the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill,"The Senate is having yet another go at repealing Obamacare, this time via legislation known as the Cassidy-Graham proposal. The bill was on life support Friday after Sen. John McCain signaled he would oppose the bill, lengthening the already long odds for its passage. Among other things, the bill would remove protections for preexisting conditions, make deep cuts to Medicaid and end the Affordable Care Act's tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies. The net result, according to a Brookings Institution analysis released Friday? Thirty-two million more people uninsured by 2027, relative to the current baseline. One factor in the bill's apparent (although not yet certain) demise: Cassidy-Graham has mobilized nearly the entire American health-care community in opposition. Dozens of national advocacy groups representing patients, doctors, insurers and hospitals have issued strongly worded condemnations of the proposal. The American Medical Association warns it violates doctors' oath to “first do no harm.” Kaiser Permanente says that any changes to health-care law should “increase access to high-quality, affordable care and coverage for as many people as possible” and that “the Cassidy-Graham bill does not meet any of those tests.” In the view of the American Hospital Association, “this proposal would erode key protections for patients and consumers and does nothing to stabilize the insurance market now or in the long term.” The American Heart Association, March of Dimes and 14 other patient and provider groups urged the Senate to “oppose this legislation.” Strikingly, The Washington Post was unable to identify any medical associations that support the measure. Some antiabortion groups, such as the March for Life and National Right to Life, do support the bill, but they are not primarily medical or health-care-oriented in focus. If you know of any such groups that support the measure, please drop me a line. We've gathered statements by dozens of medical groups below. For inclusion in the list, the groups have to have a medical focus, representing patients, providers, insurers or hospitals. The groups also have to have a national focus; because of the sheer number, including state-level medical groups or affiliates of national organizations would be difficult. This list is almost certainly incomplete, given the huge universe of advocacy groups focusing their efforts on conditions that sometimes affect only small numbers of people. But it gives a sense of the breadth and depth of the medical community's opposition to Republicans' latest attempt to repeal Obamacare. "
Red-state Medicaid directors sound the alarm about Cassidy-Graham,"THE MORNING PLUM: One of the most destructive and awful things that Cassidy-Graham would do — and there are a lot of them — is put intense pressure on states to implement a radical transformation of Medicaid delivery to their constituents in only two years. This is widely seen by health-care policy experts as a recipe for chaos. It turns out that this aspect of Cassidy-Graham has many Medicaid directors very, very worried — even in multiple red states. I’m told that many Medicaid directors from states with Republican governors privately blessed a statement from the National Association of Medicaid Directors that sharply criticizes Cassidy-Graham as unworkable and deeply destructive. The NAMD statement argues that Cassidy-Graham, which would end the Medicaid expansion and replace it with block grants to states, starting in 2020, is simply not doable for most of them. The NAMD says that the scope of implementing this change “cannot be overstated,” adding that “the vast majority of states will not be able to do so within the two-year timeframe envisioned here.” This statement from the NAMD is being widely reported on today, but people are getting crucial nuances of the story wrong. Many have said this statement represents a consensus of all of the Medicaid directors across the country. Not true: When the NAMD puts out a statement such as this, it often reflects what its board of directors says, not any consensus among all of the Medicaid directors. That is the same here. Indeed, the statement says as much in its first sentence. But in this case, something unique has indeed happened — and it is more damning than this statement first appeared to be. Matt Salo, executive director of the NAMD, tells me that the organization privately conferred with many Medicaid directors around the country, in advance of releasing this statement. It is politically sensitive for a Medicaid director to differ with his or her state’s governor on a high-profile matter. While some GOP governors have come out against Cassidy-Graham, many others have not, and some have backed it. Given that Cassidy-Graham is a high priority for President Trump and congressional Republican leaders, it is not easy for a red-state Medicaid director to oppose it. But in this case, Salo tells me, many Medicaid directors from red states privately said they were comfortable with this statement getting out to the public and lawmakers, and in many cases, they eagerly wanted this to happen. Salo emailed me this: In preparation for the Board’s statement on Graham-Cassidy, we heard from many Medicaid Directors in red states that they were very concerned about the impacts of the legislation and were at the very least comfortable, if not overwhelmingly supportive of sending a message communicating these concerns. To be clear, this is actually unusual. As Salo explained to me, these statements require affirmation from only two-thirds of the NAMD’s dozen-strong elected board of directors — only eight people — and generally do not represent the consensus view of the nation’s Medicaid directors. But in this case, many of them, including many appointed by Republican governors, did want the statement’s message out there. That message is encapsulated by these lines from the statement: How these block grants will be utilized, what programs they may fund, and the overall impact they will have on state budgets, operations, and citizens are all uncertain. Taken together, the per-capita caps and the envisioned block grant would constitute the largest intergovernmental transfer of financial risk from the federal government to the states in our country’s history. … The Graham-Cassidy legislation would require states to operationalize the block grant component by January 1, 2020. The scope of this work, and the resources required to support state planning and implementation activities, cannot be overstated. States will need to develop overall strategies, invest in infrastructure development, systems changes, provider and managed care plan contracting, and perform a host of other activities. The vast majority of states will not be able to do so within the two-year timeframe envisioned here, especially considering the apparent lack of federal funding in the bill to support these critical activities. To understand what this would entail, read this piece by Margot Sanger-Katz, which explains how Cassidy-Graham would require states to essentially rebuild their health-care systems from scratch. As Sanger-Katz notes, this would instantly “make health care an active, high-stakes political debate in all 50 states,” and in any state that failed to realize this formidable challenge, “consumers and markets would be thrown into chaos.” It turns out that the people who would be tasked with implementing these radical changes — including many appointed by Republicans — share this view. The question is whether that will weigh on the few remaining undecided GOP senators. It should — if they care in the least about the real-world consequences of their votes. * MUELLER’S SCRUTINY OF FACEBOOK’S ROLE INTENSIFIES: Facebook has announced that it will turn over to congressional investigators thousands of ads covertly bought by Russian agents, and the New York Times notes this: One question for [special counsel Robert S. Mueller III] is certain to be whether the Russian Facebook advertising — and any other promotions using Twitter or other services — showed evidence of the kind of sophisticated targeting that might indicate that Americans had provided assistance. Facebook has said some of the ads were targeted to particular geographic areas but has not given details. Facebook has given Mueller detailed data on the ads, the Times notes, meaning that we will get an answer to that question soon enough. * TAX CUTS BASED ON PHONY GOP MATH GAIN MOMENTUM: The Post reports that the White House push for enormous tax cuts is gaining momentum among Senate Republicans, and you’ll be shocked to learn what’s driving it: There is a growing willingness within the GOP to embrace controversial, optimistic estimates of how much economic growth their tax plan would create. Those upbeat estimates, often rejected by nonpartisan economists, would supplant the traditional forecasts offered by official scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation, helping lawmakers argue that the plan would not increase the national debt. Of course, Republicans have been willing to embrace such “controversial” estimates for decades, so nothing new here. * MURKOWSKI MAY BE LEANING AGAINST CASSIDY-GRAHAM: The Hill reports that Cassidy-Graham’s chief sponsors are leaning hard on Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to win her vote, but it may not be working: Right now it looks like an uphill battle to change Murkowski’s mind. “I’d say the chances are less than 30 percent. Alaska doesn’t do very well in this bill. Her governor is lukewarm on it and her insurance commissioner is not for it,” one Senate GOP aide added. Imagine a U.S. senator putting the interests of her own state over President Trump’s megalomaniacal desire to humiliate Barack Obama! * GOP GOVERNOR TEARS INTO CASSIDY-GRAHAM: Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor of Nevada, tore into the central rationale of Cassidy-Graham in a statement to the Nevada Independent: “Flexibility with reduced funding is a false choice,” Sandoval said in the statement. “I will not pit seniors, children, families, the mentally ill, the critically ill, hospitals, care providers, or any other Nevadan against each other because of cuts to Nevada’s health-care delivery system proposed by the Graham-Cassidy amendment.” The grant of “flexibility” to states is mainly cover to sell its gutting of health-care spending on poor people. And Sen. Dean Heller (R) of Nevada, which stands to lose up to $2 billion, is fine with that. * GOP IS SELLING CASSIDY-GRAHAM WITH THE SAME OLD LIES: Paul Krugman looks at all the evasions and lies Republicans are peddling to sell Cassidy-Graham and notes that they have been “standard GOP operating procedure for years”: The trick of converting federal programs into block grants, then pretending that this wouldn’t mean savage cuts, was central to every one of Paul Ryan’s much-hyped budgets. The trick of comparing dollar numbers over time to conceal huge benefit cuts has … been around since the 1990s. In other words, Graham-Cassidy isn’t an aberration; it’s more like the distilled essence of everything wrong with modern Republicans. It’s odd that these courageous ideological warriors constantly feel the need to lie about the real-world consequences of their policies. Don’t they have confidence in their ideas? * JIMMY KIMMEL IS RIGHT, AND BILL CASSIDY IS LYING: Linda Qiu and Daniel Victor take a hard look at the ongoing exchange between Jimmy Kimmel and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) over the latter’s health-care bill. Kimmel is right, and Cassidy is lying, about the bill’s deep cuts to health-care spending and its weakening of protections for people with preexisting conditions. As Kimmel put it, “I did my homework.” Too bad the bill’s chief co-sponsor didn’t — or if he did, too bad he can’t stop lying about what it would actually do. * AND IT’S THE ‘DOTARD’ VS. THE ‘MADMAN’: Good morning, Mr. President: Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn't mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before! This is apparently a response to Kim Jong Un’s statement blasting Trump as a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” Schoolyard taunts are especially awesome when those exchanging them also possess the firepower to slaughter millions with great ease.

The Health 202: Cassidy-Graham's abortion ban workaround,"THE PROGNOSIS Tony Perkins is president of the Family Research Council, a group that has pushed for antiabortion language in the Republican health-care bills. (Mary Altaffer/AP) Want the inside scoop on health care? Get more stories like this. Abortion opponents believe they’ve built an impenetrable firewall between taxpayer dollars and abortion coverage in the latest Obamacare overhaul plan known as Cassidy-Graham. The trick: Funnel the money through an existing health-care program, the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Now, they just have to make sure the Senate parliamentarian agrees with them. Bear with me, as this gets a little wonky and complicated. The issue is a major pressure point for antiabortion groups, who have long insisted that no government funds should be used to cover elective abortions. And those groups have a big influence on how conservatives vote -- especially in the House. Antiabortion groups like the Family Research Council and Susan B. Anthony List care about a few things in revamping the Affordable Care Act. A big one is ensuring the Hyde amendment -- which prohibits taxpayer funds from paying for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or if the woman’s life is at stake -- is now part of the legislation. That means that federally subsidized plans on ACA marketplaces could no longer cover the procedure. The current language in Cassidy-Graham — which the Senate may vote on next week — complies with conservatives' litmus test. But activists acknowledge the Senate parliamentarian will probably strip the Hyde language from the measure altogether, meaning that federally subsidized plans could keep covering abortions. In the last go-round, that's exactly what conservatives were worried about, too: that the Hyde amendment would be eliminated from the (now defeated) Better Care Reconciliation Act pushed by Senate Republicans under special rules governing the budget process.(That’s the vehicle Republicans are using to try to overturn much of the ACA because it doesn't require Democratic votes.) Democrats believed that the parliamentarian agreed with them in that the Hyde language had to go, though Republicans said that guidance wasn't final. This is important because had Hyde been eliminated from BCRA, antiabortion groups might have turned against that bill altogether because it would have maintained marketplace subsidies (albeit reshaping them) that go toward plans that cover abortions. The same problem exists for Cassidy-Graham. Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee are expected to meet early next week with the parliamentarian, who rules on which provisions can go into a budget bill (that process is known as a “Byrd bath”). The Hyde language could get eliminated if the parliamentarian says it’s not closely enough tied to spending. But these activists will probably just shrug their shoulders if those subsidies are given the green light this time. That’s because that measure eventually phases out the marketplace subsidies anyway. Starting in 2021, it would funnel them through CHIP, which already contains the Hyde restrictions. States could use the money mostly as they wish – but they would be barred from paying for elective abortions or plans that cover them. Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough. (Photo by Jakub Mosur) In short, abortion foes feel their goals will be achieved no matter what, as long as parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough gives the OK to Cassidy-Graham’s overall structure of turning subsidy money over to states. “If Elizabeth MacDonough buys that whole structure, then we’re golden,” Family Research Council lobbyist David Christensen told me. Of course, if the Hyde language somehow stays in Cassidy-Graham and the whole bill becomes law, insurers would face an immediate, pressing question: What to do about dozens of health plans that cover abortions? The prohibition would go into effect immediately, applying to 2018 plans that are up for sale starting in just a few weeks, on Nov. 1. This wouldn't be an issue in about half the states, which have passed their own restrictions on abortion coverage in the ACA marketplaces. Insurers already had to exclude coverage from the plans they’re selling in those states, so they wouldn’t need to scramble to change anything at the last minute. But it could complicate the situation in the other states -- particularly in California, New York and Oregon -- that actually require most plans to cover abortions. Even if the Senate passes Cassidy-Graham next week, the House likely couldn’t consider it until October, after the point at which states are supposed to have their marketplace offerings all firmed up for next year. Of course, that’s not all abortion-rights advocates have to be worried about. Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards. (Zach Gibson/AP) As with previous repeal bills, Cassidy-Graham essentially bans Planned Parenthood from getting Medicaid reimbursements for one year. Medicaid dollars already can’t be spent on abortions (barring the exceptions laid out under Hyde), but conservatives say the women’s health organization shouldn’t get any taxpayer dollars, period, as long as they continue to provide the procedure. That’s left Planned Parenthood, which relies on federal reimbursements and grants for about 43 percent of its budget, in a defensive posture as it tries to protect itself from deep funding cuts. The group's president, Cecile Richards, stressed to Marie Claire magazine this week that its clinics use Medicaid dollars for a variety of health-care services including cancer screenings and birth control. Planned Parenthood said this week its supporters have organized more than 2,200 events across the country, made more than 300,000 phone calls and delivered more than 1 million signatures to members of Congress opposing the defunding effort. “These next 12 days are make-or-break for the health care millions of people rely on,” said Erica Sackin, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Action Fund. “Graham-Cassidy is the worst version of Trumpcare we’ve seen yet.” Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in June. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) --Jetting around the country by private plane has become the norm for Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who has taken at least 24 flights on private charter planes at taxpayers’ expense since early May, according to the latest report by Politico. The trips cost more than $300,000 in total, according to a review of federal contracts and similar trip itineraries, write Dan Diamond and Rachana Pradhan. Price’s use of private jets represents a sharp departure from his two immediate predecessors"
Sorry I can't go to your thing. I must call my senator to plead for my life.,"An email template from the near future. I am sorry I cannot make it to your event, but I have to call Congress every eight minutes to plead for my life. Would I like to go to your wedding/bar mitzvah/coffee date/movie/quiet place where sleep is possible? You bet. But you know that if I don’t call my senator and register my opposition, the new Terrible Health-Care-Ending Bill to Unleash Boils Across the Land, Replace the Rivers with Blood and Slay All the Firstborn will go through, and the time between those bills is getting shorter and shorter. It is not that I don’t want to be there for your life milestone. I do! I am just really concerned that my senator might prefer for this state to have six costly nowhere bridges studded with diamonds than to prevent millions of people from being flung off their insurance, and I am not willing to take that chance, not even for the six minutes that will pass between the inception of this bill and its introduction on the Senate floor for a vote. (Just a minute; in the course of typing this response they have already introduced another bill and I have to call again.) Sorry. I’m back. On a related note, I am sorry that last week I set your baby hastily on the ground and rushed to a landline telephone to plead with my senator, but I am just doing what I can to stop people with preexisting conditions from losing access to care. I am sure Warren will thank me when she is older. Was it rude of me to run screaming out of the team meeting just as you had fired up your PowerPoint presentation? Undoubtedly. But was it not even more rude of the Senate to decide that if we did not call them within 90 seconds we would all be thrown into a high-risk pool filled with nurse sharks? (An especially mean touch, since those have NURSE in the name yet are not nurses but SHARKS.) (Sorry, again, in the few moments it took me to type that sentence, a new, terrible Obamacare replacement has been introduced and is rapidly heading toward the floor for a vote without a CBO score or even a fun, memorable acronym.) Back. I don’t enjoy this any more than you do. Would I like to not have to sit here all day every day staring into the Internet trying not to blink, lest during the time it takes me to shut my eyes and open them the Senate holds enough of a semblance of a debate on a bill to placate a skimpy majority of senators? Undoubtedly. But we no longer have that luxury. I could swear that only a month ago I was able to read an entire letter from the AMA denouncing a proposed Obamacare replacement before the bill reached the floor, but now I do not even have that kind of time. Why, I remember when Senators used to have to stand in front of the media and insist that they were not in favor of letting people lose their coverage. Now, they just hiss at the press in the hallways as they run from the Non-Committee to the Non-Debate. So, I’m sorry I cannot be there. I cannot be anywhere. I have not gone underground in months. I cannot risk it. What if, during the few seconds I was left without cell reception, John McCain inexplicably decided he did not care about regular order any longer? Then where would we be? We are locked in this battle until one of these bills passes, or all the callers die. But I repeat myself.

Transcript: Transformers Health,
Republicans point out the solid base of their health-care plan,
Republicans’ last frantic attempt to destroy Obamacare gives the game away,"The latest GOP plan to kill Obamacare is now just Ahab lashing himself to his white whale, in an obsession that defies all policy discussion. Republicans’ efforts have nothing any longer to do with health care at all. They are merely block-granting the money away, for health care or not. Whatever. Long gone are promises (lies) to provide more care for less money. They never intended to provide more care with less money. They never had a way to do that. They just said it because the words sounded so nice. They never had even the intention of doing that, except possibly President Trump, and only him because he didn’t know it was so complicated, and so he assumed that whatever he imagined must be possible. But now we are at the haywire stage. The scorched-earth stage. The plan to kill Obamacare is now so fevered that the party supports any plan it can scrape up votes for. The actual plans that Republicans have been considering get worse and worse with regard to actual health care, as do their justifications for them. Congressional Budget Office numbers need not apply. Nor actual patients. It comes down to this: Republicans don’t want government involved in health care, even IF the result is better health care at the best price. They say that it is simply impossible, despite evidence from other nations. This is nothing but blind ideology at work. And this is where that takes us: If the private market won’t deliver affordable care to millions of Americans, then they must do without. Simple as that. Do without, as in get sick, stay sick and/or die. Those dying may comfort themselves with a good book, such as reading Ayn Rand’s withering contempt for their weakness. So goodbye Republican self-image as the creative, smart party looking for better ways to meet actual needs. They now have only one need: to destroy the government as a participant in American life. As a check on corporate power. As a guardian of product safety. As a protector of the environment. Eventually, their constituents will discover that they’ve lost their health-care coverage, but by then the lawmakers will be well-paid lobbyists, and their constituents will be receiving good treatment in the obituary pages. "
Cassidy-Graham could still blow up in the GOP's face. Here's how.,"THE MORNING PLUM: If this morning’s reporting is accurate, zombie Trumpcare still appears to have a reasonable chance of passing. But there is one scenario in which the Cassidy-Graham repeal bill could not just fail, but also go down in spectacular fashion, creating an unexpectedly huge mess for Republicans. The Senate parliamentarian still may rule on whether key aspects of the bill can pass by a simple majority under reconciliation rules. If she strips out one of its most important features — the one allowing states to waive some of the Affordable Care Act’s regulations — it could suddenly upend the deliberations of undecided senators. It would force a rapid vote on a measure that has changed dramatically with only a few days left, rendering this whole process even more abysmally absurd. And it would make failure — spectacular failure — more likely. Politico reports that Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), the key swing vote, is having intense discussions with Health and Human Services Department bureaucrats about what the bill — which is sponsored by Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) — would really do. Thus, swing senators are still trying to figure out what impact it would have on their states. But the whole bill could still change — in a big way. In addition to killing the mandate and the Medicaid expansion and subsidies and replacing them with block grants to states that will mean less money for many of them, Cassidy-Graham also allows states to seek waivers from the ACA’s provisions that prevent insurers from gouging people with preexisting conditions and require them to cover essential health benefits. This is meant to give states “flexibility,” in part to use federal funds to cover people as they see fit, and in part to let insurers offer skimpier coverage and/or lower prices for healthy people. It’s also why the bill would effectively weaken or kill protections for people with preexisting conditions — while insurers cannot explicitly deny those people coverage, they can jack up their premiums and decline to offer benefits they need, leaving them stranded. But some health policy analysts think there’s a decent chance that the parliamentarian will strike those deregulatory features under the Byrd Rule, because they don’t have a direct budgetary component. Daniel Hemel of the University of Chicago, for instance, points out that a very similar feature was struck from a previous GOP repeal bill and thinks it should — and very well may — happen again. We don’t know whether this will happen. But it’s possible, and if so, it would be a big deal. Senators would then be voting on a bill that leaves the ACA’s regulations on preexisting conditions and essential health benefits in place but gives the states less money to cover people. I asked Hemel what the consequences of this would be, and he emailed: Without the waiver provision, Graham-Cassidy is a totally different bill. It doesn’t provide states with flexibility, but it still takes away a lot of money. This would change the terms of the debate entirely — and would do so just a few days before the senators cast their final votes. Hemel added that “the most likely scenario” is that the parliamentarian determines “that the provision is primarily non-budgetary and so must be stricken from the bill.” Nicholas Bagley of the University of Michigan agrees and adds that this would mean that a primary selling point for the bill would vanish: It would no longer meaningfully offer the states “flexibility” and would no longer constitute the “federalism” that supporters have extolled. An additional point: The “flexibility” argument is also an inducement to get states that have expanded Medicaid to accept an outcome in which block grants replace the Medicaid expansion. This is the core of the conservative argument for Cassidy-Graham — many states get less money, but more flexibility to define down what counts as coverage — and it’s one that undecided senators are weighing. Murkowski has said she is trying to decide whether this flexibility makes the trade-off worth it. But if the parliamentarian strikes the waiver provisions, Cassidy-Graham would only be offering the block grants — which mean a reduction in funding — without the flexibility that is meant to sweeten that deal and give states leeway to make that funding work for them. It’s hard to see how Murkowski — and perhaps other GOP senators from Medicaid expansion states — could accept such an outcome. At that point, they’d only be voting to gut the government’s commitment to trying to expand coverage to all their constituents, including the poorest of them — without even the “flexibility” argument to give them cover for it. What’s more, if that ruling were to happen, it would dramatically change Cassidy-Graham with very little time left before the vote to figure out what the consequences would be. If you think this process has been a disaster so far, it could get a whole lot worse. * MUELLER SCRUTINIZES TRUMP’S EXPLANATION FOR KEY MEETING: The New York Times reports that Robert S. Mueller III is scrutinizing President Trump’s role in falsifying the reason for the meeting between top Trump campaign officials and the Russian lawyer: In July, when The Times put questions about the meeting to the White House, Mr. Trump and senior administration officials prepared a response on Air Force One that made no mention of the meeting’s real purpose, saying instead that it focused on Russian adoptions. Mr. Mueller has asked for all documents the White House has about the meeting, and all internal White House communications about the statement drafted on Air Force One. We subsequently learned from Donald Trump Jr.’s email chain that Trump officials eagerly took the meeting in the expectation of dirt about Hillary Clinton provided by the Russian government. * MUELLER DEMANDS DOCUMENTS RELATING TO COMEY FIRING: The Post adds the nugget that Mueller wants all documents relating to Trump’s firing of former FBI director James B. Comey: Mueller has asked for all documents related to meetings between Trump and Comey while Comey served at the FBI, records of any discussions regarding Comey’s firing and any documents related to a statement by then-press secretary Sean Spicer made on the night Comey was fired. He has also asked for any documents related to a meeting Trump held in the Oval Office with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov the day after Comey was fired. Our picture of the process behind the Comey firing is based on dogged reporting and Comey’s testimony, and remains incomplete — but could be at the core of Trump’s possible obstruction of justice. * A PAUL MANAFORT TIMELINE: The Post reports that former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort offered a Kremlin-allied billionaire a private briefing on the campaign. Axios offers up a comprehensive timeline of much of what is known about Manafort, and how it emerged. The summary: Manafort was in the room when Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer hoping for dirt on Hilary Clinton. One month later, he reportedly sent an email to a Russian billionaire offering private briefings on the campaign. Before he even signed on with Trump, the FBI was reportedly secretly monitoring his calls. Now, he’s at the center of Robert Mueller’s investigation. The full timeline paints a picture of a probe that is slowly closing in. * NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER CASSIDY-GRAHAM CAN PASS: Politico recaps the state of play, noting that there will likely be a vote next week, but it’s unclear whether it can get 50 senators. And this: It’s still anyone’s guess whether the bill’s backers can get to 50 votes. One Republican senator suggested that [Senate Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell may ultimately decide to bring the bill up for another failed vote, in part to show GOP donors and President Donald Trump that the Senate GOP tried again. If it fails, surely Trump will rationally evaluate the outcome, conclude repeal just doesn’t have enough support, and refrain from furiously spraying tweets at McConnell ever again. * ALASKA HEALTH CARE COULD BE DEVASTATED BY GRAHAM-CASSIDY: With Sen. Lisa Murkowski still undecided on Cassidy-Graham, Becky Hultberg, president of the Alaska State Hospital and Nursing Home Association, sounds the alarm: “The cuts could be devastating to our health care system, including rural and frontier hospitals that operate on razor-thin margins,” Ms. Hultberg said in an interview. “These hospitals are often accessible only by airplane or ferry, so the loss of a hospital means an expensive and disruptive medical evacuation out of the community.” It would also mean substantially less money for her state. It’s still unclear why this is even a hard call for Murkowski, who already voted against previous repeal bills that weren’t this bad. * TRUMP’S APPROVAL TICKS UP — BUT DID OUTREACH TO DEMOCRATS HELP? NBC’s First Read crew brings us a new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll finding that Trump’s approval has inched up to 43 percent. But this could be “with the help of his bipartisan move”: 71 percent of Americans support his deal with Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi on hurricane relief and keeping the government open for three months. The bad news: The public gives Trump low marks on almost everything else. The new NBC poll finds Trump’s numbers on numerous specific issues to be in the toilet. No doubt Trump will learn from this by scotching any outreach to Democrats while pressing forward with everything else. * MORE ABSURD GOP DISSEMBLING: After Jimmy Kimmel unloaded on him, Sen. Bill Cassidy insisted that “more people will have coverage” under his bill. Glenn Kessler debunks the claim by pointing out that deep cuts to spending will likely mean less coverage. As one expert notes: “It’s a very high bar to argue that federal funding to states will be cut by $160 billion (other estimates are higher) between 2020 and 2026 (forget whether it ends in 2027 or not) and coverage will stay the same or increase.” This is just another version of the same old claim that magical GOP solutions will — presto! — mean more coverage for less money. * HOPES THAT TRUMP WILL EVOLVE ARE DELUSIONAL: E.J. Dionne Jr. looks at all the problems with Trump’s speech to the United Nations and makes an important point about some commentators who bent over backward to praise it: He also won praise from a group who are not really Trump-friendly but whom I have come to see as inspired by a hope: They calculate that if enough people say enough encouraging things whenever Trump seems to offer relatively normal ideas or take normal actions, he will respond to positive reinforcement and do more normal things over time. Perhaps this would prove to be true, but it sounds like a coping technique that parents of teenagers might employ, and that is disturbing. What’s also odd is that each time we see this sort of response, Trump promptly does something crazy or disgusting that proves how delusional it is. Yet it keeps coming back.

Lawrence Summers: The Cassidy-Graham vote is a chance for a Republican to be a hero,"There is an opportunity for one or two Republican senators to be 21st-century Profiles in Courage. A senator who stands up to his or her party and casts the decisive vote against the Cassidy-Graham health legislation will be seen by history as a hero. Cassidy-Graham is the cruelest and most misguided piece of consequential legislation proposed so far in the 21st century. It is far worse than the “repeal and replace” bills that Congress has so far voted down. Cassidy-Graham is much more dangerous than previous bills, both because it goes further in eliminating critical parts of the Affordable Care Act and because it savages the pre-ACA Medicaid safety net. Start with what Cassidy-Graham does to the ACA, which established the landmark principle that health insurers could not discriminate against sick people or those with preexisting conditions. This idea was endorsed even by President Trump and preserved in earlier legislation. Cassidy-Graham restores the ability of private insurers to exclude people with preexisting conditions. It also knocks out the entirely reasonable provisions of the ACA requiring that insurance cover mental health, substance abuse treatment and maternity. And it eliminates the funding that went to expand coverage under the ACA through Medicaid expansion and tax credits, instead providing a block grant to states that is insufficient to replace it before ending altogether in 2026. [Under Cassidy-Graham, health-care spending would drop in all but 16 states. Fifteen voted for Trump.] Maybe even worse than what Cassidy-Graham does to the ACA is what it does to the underlying Medicaid program. Rather than maintain the federal guarantee to fund a share of Medicaid costs currently in place, the bill would convert the Medicaid program to a “per-capita cap” — with cuts that grow deeper over time. One consulting firm, Avalere, estimated that the cuts to Medicaid outside of the ACA would be over $1 trillion by 2036. That would inevitably require states to make deep cuts to coverage and services for the seniors in long-term care, people with disabilities and families with children who use the program. I don’t understand how those supporting Cassidy-Graham live with themselves. People will die and they will be responsible. And what will follow ultimately after the backlash comes will make the ACA look like a libertarian dream. If ever there was a moment for a courageous Republican to step up, this is it. "
The new Republican plan to repeal Obamacare is the worst one yet,"Republicans have come up with an innovative, new plan to repeal Obamacare. Instead of cutting health-care spending for the poor and letting insurance companies once again discriminate against the sick in the name of personal freedom, they want to cut health-care spending for the poor and let insurance companies once again discriminate against the sick in the name of state freedom. Like I said, it's innovative. Now, there are two things you need to know about this last-ditch effort to eliminate Obamacare. The first is that Republicans only have until Sept. 30 to do so. That's when their ability to pass a health-care bill with just 50 votes in the Senate instead of the 60 it takes to beat a filibuster will turn into a legislative pumpkin, assuming that they want to preserve this power for their tax cuts later on (which, it goes without saying, they do). The second is that this latest plan, which they've settled on by default since they've already voted down all their others, might actually go further to cut health-care spending than their previous ones. We can't say for sure, though, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office won't have time to conduct a full analysis beforehand. So what do we know? Well, the big picture is this plan, co-sponsored by Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), would take all the money Obamacare currently spends on subsidizing health insurance and expanding Medicaid, and give some of it back to the states directly. This is what is known as a “block grant.” But there are a couple of key differences here. The first is that this money would come with far fewer strings attached than it does under Obamacare. States, for example, could go back to letting insurance companies charge sick people more — good luck affording coverage if you have a preexisting condition like diabetes, or depression, or … acne? — or de facto do so by selling skimpy plans to healthy people and more expensive ones to everybody else. Not to mention that they wouldn't be required to use this money to help cover people like they are now. If they wanted to, they could put this money toward things like paying providers or keeping out-of-pocket costs down — worthwhile goals, but not ones that would give insurance to somebody who doesn't have it. The second difference is who would get the money. Cassidy is worried it's “not fair” that 37 percent of the revenue from the Affordable Care Act goes to Americans in” the “four states” of California"
Cassidy-Graham and fuzzy math,"The Post reports on the latest in the saga of the Graham-Cassidy health-care bill: Powerful health-care groups continued to rail against the bill, including AARP and the American Hospital Association, both of which urged a no vote. But it was unclear whether the opposition would ultimately derail the attempt, as key Republican senators including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said they had yet to make up their minds. The measure marks the last gasp of Republican attempts to dramatically gut Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which has added millions of people to the ranks of the insured through a combination of federally subsidized marketplaces and state-level expansions of Medicaid, leading to record lows in the number of those without health insurance. The Graham-Cassidy bill — named for Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Bill Cassidy (La.) — would convert funding for the ACA into block grants for the states and would cut Medicaid dramatically over time. What is striking is the degree of haphazardness and lack of specificity that infuses the entire process. Experts on different sides come up with wildly different numbers, which differ from one another — all derived in good faith — and from the Graham-Cassidy numbers, which seems to lack the analytical rigor one would expect of something so serious. The implications of the bill are obscured by carefully scripted talking points. Yes, the bill leaves in place the ACA’s provision requiring insurers to offer coverage for preexisting conditions. But wait — states can easily obtain waivers charge more for certain services. Oh, governors wouldn’t want to do that to their people! Really? Preexisting exclusions were quite common before Obamacare put an end to them. Moreover, some analyses do not calculate the impact of a per capita cap on the Medicaid program; that’s a hard calculation, I am told. For all of these reasons, it is especially important to have a complete Congressional Budget Office scoring — something the bill’s sponsors will not have in hand before the vote, if it comes, next week. Of most concern should be the impact on Medicaid. The Kaiser Family Foundation finds: Much is at stake for low-income Americans and states in the Graham-Cassidy proposal. The recent debate over the [American Health Care Act] and the [Better Care Reconciliation Act] has shown the difficulty of making major changes that affect coverage for over 70 million Americans and reduce federal funding for Medicaid. Medicaid has broad support and majorities across political parties say Medicaid is working well. More than half of the states have a strong stake in continuing the ACA Medicaid expansion as it has provided coverage to millions of low-income residents, reduced the uninsured and produced net fiscal benefits to states. Graham-Cassidy prohibits states from using Medicaid to provide coverage to childless adults. With regard to Medicaid financing changes, caps on federal funding could shift costs to states and result in less fiscal flexibility for states. States with challenging demographics (like an aging population), high health care needs (like those hardest hit by the opioid epidemic), high cost markets or states that operate efficient programs may have the hardest time responding to federal caps on Medicaid spending. Faced with substantially reduced federal funding, states would face difficult choices: raise revenue, reduce spending in other areas, or cut Medicaid provider payments, optional benefits, and/or optional coverage groups. Manatt Health finds: Over 2020 to 2026, the block grant would provide states with $81.6 billion less in federal funding than would be available under current law, a reduction of 6.4 percent. In 2026, national funding for the block grant is 8.9 percent below current law spending projections. Most states would receive less funding under the block grant than under current law. … 32 states would receive less federal funding in 2020 under the unadjusted amount of the block grant. By 2026, some states fare better, but the majority (27 states) continue to face a loss of federal funding. Over the 2020 to 2026 period, 29 states receive less in federal funding with an average reduction of 19 percent. In some states, the loss of federal funding is significantly higher, reflecting the disparate impact of the Graham-Cassidy proposal on states that have expanded Medicaid and/or generally have higher-cost care. States such as Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington would see reductions of 25 percent or more over the 2020 to 2026 period under the Graham-Cassidy unadjusted allotments relative to current law. More than with any previous health-care proposal, the level of complexity coupled with the level of uncertainty here make proceeding without full hearings and scoring particularly reprehensible.

Trump's repeal push just took a massive new hit,"THE MORNING PLUM: Senate Republicans are stumbling forward with their new zombie Trumpcare bill to repeal Obamacare — and they will hold a vote this month, before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office tells them how many people might be tossed off of coverage if it becomes law. The drawback of this — or is it a benefit, given that the public is also being kept in the dark? — is that Republicans will vote on the bill without knowing all that much about how it would impact their own states, not to mention the rest of the country. Unfortunately for the bill’s supporters, a new study just came out that will enable Republicans to make a somewhat more informed decision about this legislation, after all. And it could deal a blow to the bill’s chances. It should, anyway. The study, which was released this morning by Avalere Health, a consulting firm, finds that many states will see sizable cuts to the federal money that would flow to their states, relative to current law. Some of those states are represented by the GOP senators who are currently deciding whether to back the bill, including Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine), Rob Portman (Ohio) and John McCain (Ariz.). Here’s a chart from the study that demonstrates how the bill — which is being championed by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) — would impact the federal funding to states. Because of the bill’s complex funding formula, some states gain, relative to what spending would be under current law (the Affordable Care Act), and others lose. The blue ones are the losers. (Click on the chart to enlarge it.) Graham-Cassidy kills the ACA’s Medicaid expansion and subsidies for lower-income enrollees on the exchanges, starting in 2020, and replaces them with block grants to the states, which can then spend the money on coverage in other ways, or on other things entirely. (After 2026, the block grants end.) The bill’s proponents claim that the states will merely gain flexibility under it. But as the new study shows, because of the bill’s funding formula, a lot of states will end up with substantially less federal money to spend on health-care coverage than they would have under current law. In the period from 2020 to 2026, overall the bill will mean a $215 billion cut to federal spending. Here’s how that cut will impact individual states: Rand Paul, who is thought to be a hard “no,” has previously criticized the bill for redistributing money among states. This study illustrates in graphic new detail just how bad this would be. As Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at Avalere, put it: “The largest impact of the proposed bill would be the reallocation of federal dollars between states. Medicaid expansion states and states that have enrolled a high number of people in insurance affordability programs would be most adversely impacted.” And a lot of Republican senators represent such states. Colorado (Cory Gardner) would lose $6 billion. Pennsylvania (Pat Toomey) would also lose $6 billion. Florida (Marco Rubio) would lose $4 billion. Here’s another key point: The cuts get substantially worse after 2026, when the block grants run out. According to the Avalere study, if you factor in the total cuts under Graham-Cassidy from 2020 to 2036 — including 10 years after the block grants expire — that means a $14 billion cut to Alaska; a $133 billion cut to Arizona; a $161 billion cut to Ohio; a $17 billion cut to Maine; and a $27 billion cut to West Virginia. In other words, the bill also creates a massive fiscal cliff for many states who stand to take an enormous wallop after 2026. The bill’s proponents say Congress will reauthorize the spending at that point. But states cannot count on that, and they will have to plan accordingly, making it extremely challenging to design programs, even with additional “flexibility.” The bottom line: GOP senators who vote for Graham-Cassidy will be voting not just to slash funding to their own states in the short term; but also possibly to put them in a seriously damaging long term bind. * RNC SHELLS OUT BIGLY FOR TRUMP’S LEGAL FEES: CNN reports that the Republican National committee coughed up more than $230,000 in August to cover Trump’s legal fees in the ongoing Russia probe: The RNC paid Trump’s personal attorneys Jay Sekulow and John Dowd $131,250 and $100,000, respectively, via their law firms, the official said. … The RNC has also begun to foot the legal payments of Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. The committee paid nearly $200,000 of Trump Jr.’s legal bills related to the Russia investigation… Hey, if it results in a nice, fat tax cut for big GOP donors, it will all have been worthwhile. * MOUNTING OPPOSITION TO GRAHAM-CASSIDY: The New York Times takes stock of the depth of opposition, particularly on one lone senator from Alaska: It was the opposition of Alaska’s governor, Bill Walker, that might prove most important. He increased pressure on Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, to cast what could be a deciding vote to kill the repeal effort. … The American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and AARP, the lobby for older Americans, all urged the Senate to reject the bill. And 10 of the 12 governors opposing the measure signed a letter urging Senate leaders to scrap it. On the other side is Trump, who desperately wants to sign something that in his mind constitutes wiping his feet on former president Barack Obama’s face, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who hopes to avoid Trump’s Twitter wrath. Easy call, Sen. Murkowski! * WHY IS MURKOWSKI STILL UNDECIDED? The Post explains that Graham-Cassidy could be even worse for Mukowski’s home state of Alaska than previous ones (which she opposed) were: Certain aspects of the new bill pose an even bigger challenge for Alaska than previous proposals did. Health-care premiums are particularly expensive in the state, given its many remote areas. … Since federal tax credits over time would be equalized and based on the number of low-income people in a given state, that new calculation would eliminate the more generous subsidies Alaska enjoys. And on top of that, Graham-Cassidy’s Medicaid cuts would also hit Alaska, which expanded Medicaid. * GOP LAWMAKERS ‘PUZZLED’ ABOUT GRAHAM-CASSIDY: Politico offers an eyebrow-raising tidbit: GOP lawmakers … are eager to fulfill their seven-year repeal vow but … remain puzzled about what the bill would actually mean for their home states — especially since the Congressional Budget Office said it will not have details about the practical implications of the bill, including how many people could lose coverage and the impact on insurance premiums, “for at least several weeks.” Huh. You’d think they might want to figure out what the bill means for their states before voting on it. Yet at least 45 GOP senators, and probably more, will vote yes without knowing this. * OBAMACARE SABOTAGE WORKS: Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services has slashed the budget for advertising to try to boost enrollment on the ACA exchanges. But HuffPost’s Jonathan Cohn reports that internal HHS data show that the ads worked in the past: The HHS research suggested that, combined, all advertising was responsible for about 37 percent of new enrollees signing up. … In addition, HHS found, advertising had driven a roughly equal proportion of existing enrollees to shop on healthcare.gov and re-enroll that way. The last part is important, because enrollees who shop around for new plans rather than simply enrolling in the same ones can frequently find better deals. No wonder they cut the budget on the enrollment ads. Can’t have Obamacare succeeding, can we? * MUELLER IS REACHING DEEP INTO PAUL MANAFORT’S DEALINGS: CNN scoops that special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe is reaching back more than a decade in examining former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort’s business dealings: The broad time frame is the latest indication that Mueller’s team is going well beyond Russian meddling during the campaign as part of its investigation of Trump campaign associates. … Mueller’s team has warned Manafort that they are working to charge him with possible tax and financial crimes, the sources said, an indication the investigation could be in an advanced stage. Bonus tidbit: Mueller has the notes that Manafort took at the meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr. which signaled the Trump team’s eagerness to collude with Russian efforts to tip the election. * AND JIMMY KIMMEL WEIGHS IN AGAIN: Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) previously endorsed the “Jimmy Kimmel test,” based on Kimmel’s suggestion that no child should lack care because a family can’t afford it. Last night, Kimmel ripped into Cassidy for failing the test with the Graham-Cassidy bill: “Not only did Bill Cassidy fail the Jimmy Kimmel test, he failed the Bill Cassidy test. … This guy, Bill Cassidy, just lied right to my face … We can’t let him do this to our children and our senior citizens and our veterans or to any of us. … I am politicizing my son’s health problems — because I have to. … There’s a new Jimmy Kimmel test for you. It’s called the lie-detector test. You’re welcome to stop by the studio and take it anytime.” Something tells us that Cassidy might not take Kimmel up on that.

The McConnell mentality keeps the Senate and Congress dysfunctional,"Imagine if all serious differences forging a bipartisan bill could be overcome, allowing for some genuine security for the most vulnerable in our society and moving closer to consensus on health care. It might encourage similar moves on other issues. It might restore some trust in government. Well, we had it and because it was bipartisan, non-extreme and did not afford the Republican Senate a win for the sake of winning and the chance to get back in the good graces of the manifestly unfit and unstable president, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) stepped in to nix it. That is what, according to multiple sources, happened yesterday as Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) cleared the decks on substantive issues. But then Alexander got yanked back. He hinted at the pressure he was under when he told the press he was “not a magician.” Too embarrassed to acknowledge he’d been stomped on by McConnell, he put out a patently disingenuous statement. “Senator Murray and I had hoped to agree early this week on a limited, bipartisan plan to stabilize 2018 premiums in the individual health insurance market that we could take to Senate leaders by the end of the month,” he said. “During the last month, we have worked hard and in good faith, but have not found the necessary consensus among Republicans and Democrats to put a bill in the Senate leaders’ hands that could be enacted.” In fact the only problem was his majority leadership, desperately straining to please the president with a partisan, fly-by-night repeal of Obamacare. Murray hit back with her own statement. “I was very glad that Chairman Alexander kicked off this bipartisan process to tackle health care uncertainty and the higher premiums facing families if Congress doesn’t act. We’ve held hearings, we’ve had discussions that included over half the Senate, and we’ve negotiated in good faith for weeks to try achieve, as Chairman Alexander puts it so well, ‘a result’ for our constituents.” She conceded that she made “some tough concessions to move in Chairman Alexander’s direction when it comes to giving states more flexibility.” However, she let on, “Republican leaders have decided to freeze this bipartisan approach and are trying to jam through a partisan Trumpcare bill, but I am confident that we can reach a deal if we keep working together—and I am committed to getting that done.” One couldn’t help but feel a bit embarrassed for Alexander, a seasoned legislator who had been rapped on the knuckles and retreated like an obedient school boy. Minority Leader Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) confirmed what everyone minimally plugged into the day’s events on the Hill knew: “This is not about substance. We gave them many of the things they asked for, including copper plans and wide waiver authority. The Republican leadership is so eager to pass Graham-Cassidy that they’re scuttling a balanced, bipartisan negotiation.” It would have been one thing had the GOP bill at issue been solid legislation designed to help Americans get affordable health-care coverage. It’s not; it’s a more indiscriminate assault on Medicaid and support for the health-care exchanges than prior bills. As Axios reported, it does not even contain sweeteners that would have made it palatable to some members. Without a gradual wind-down of Medicaid expansion, “Graham-Cassidy comes with a steep cliff after which all funding for both the subsidies and Medicaid expansion would disappear.” It has no pool of money for opioid abuse treatment. Obamacare taxes remain in place but not iron-clad protection for those with pre-existing conditions. When and if voters find out what’s in it, they may be outraged to find out that tens of millions of Americans will go without coverage. The way in which this is being forced forward — by sabotaging an actually bipartisan, regular-order bill — is a particularly personal slap in the face of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who made an impassioned plea last time around for regular order and bipartisanship. McCain has implored his colleagues to work together in open, not by stealth and connivance. These kind of machinations (no full scoring, a rush to judgment, crush bipartisan alternatives, etc.) are not what McCain has spent his life defending; the trickery surrounding Cassidy-Graham provides one more sign that under McConnell’s tutelage the Senate has become a more pompous version of the House (in which party discipline is sacred, not the tradition of open debate). McCain will need to brush aside any last minute guilt-tripping appeals from his friend Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) if he is once more to block the Senate’s road to ruin and secure his legacy. As a source close to Murray told me, squashing the Alexander-Murray effort made clear bipartisanship will be punished, not rewarded. Instead, a pattern will be established: Crush bipartisan compromises and force-feed partisan bills even if they accomplish few if any of the objectives Republicans or Trump promised. It will not be fully scored when it must come to the floor next week to get under the wire of the current fiscal year, whereby they can use reconciliation to pass with zero Democratic support. One comes away convinced that so long as the mentality of “win at any cost for the sake of winning” prevails — with no concern for the substance of immensely consequential legislation and active hostility to bipartisan solutions — Congress will remain a dysfunctional mess. McConnell will not change, and so only a change in the Senate and/or House majority will bring about a new approach to governance. Tuesday was a vivid example of why good governance and Republican majorities no longer mix.

The Health 202: Everything you need to know about who stands where on Graham-Cassidy,"THE PROGNOSIS Republicans are fixated on the latest version of their Obamacare overhaul legislation. But in their haste to secure approval, they’ve not exactly won over their deepest skeptics, who objected to the last dramatic repeal-and-replace go-round. Doctors, hospitals, insurers, activists and governors have been staking out their positions on the Graham-Cassidy bill, which the White House and leadership are furiously pitching this week to Senate Republicans as their final chance to ditch the Affordable Care Act. It goes without saying that in the liberal camp, all the groups and politicians opposed to the last batch of ACA rollback bills are fighting Graham-Cassidy, too. But their opposition is only peripheral to the bill’s prospects, because Republicans were never going to win over progressives anyway. But more significantly, Republicans still haven’t managed to win over industry groups — or convince some moderate Republican governors who worried that the previous plans would leave millions of Americans uninsured. Nor are many of the conservative activist groups — who were the most insistent on Obamacare repeal to begin with — terribly enthused about Graham-Cassidy, since they feel it would leave too much of the ACA in place. Now, heavy opposition doesn’t necessarily mean Republicans will desist. After all, the House passed a health-care bill this year that was deeply unpopular. For many congressional Republicans, passing a health-care bill was always more about getting rid of President Barack Obama's landmark legislation than building consensus around a replacement plan. And don’t underestimate the power of a tight timeline to light a fire under Congress. When three repeal bills failed in the Senate over the summer, Republicans knew they could always return to the effort. But now they have less than two weeks before the legislative vehicle they’re using expires. Dealbreakers in July are not always dealbreakers in September, as one lobbyist told me. Furthermore, the White House is all in, dispatching Vice President Pence and other top officials to Capitol Hill yesterday to make the case for Graham-Cassidy. Vice President Pence‬ departs after meeting with senators during the weekly Republican luncheon on Tuesday. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst “I’m going to make the case: This is the moment, now is the time,” Pence told reporters on Air Force Two. “We have 12 days.” Top GOP policy wonk Lanhee Chen told me he’s more bullish about prospects for Graham-Cassidy than he was for the Better Care Reconciliation Act that failed in the Senate two months ago. “The energy is there, much more so than we saw during the [Better Care Reconciliation Act] debate earlier,” Chen said. “The White House is much more engaged than I ever saw them during the Senate debate, too. I would take it seriously.” Yet it will be no big surprise if Republicans fall one or two votes short of the 50 votes they need to pass Graham-Cassidy. Skeptical moderates are getting heavy pressure from many sides to reject it. Here’s a look at where key stakeholders are lining up on the bill: INDUSTRY GROUPS: Mostly no. —American Hospital Association: “We believe that coverage could be at risk for tens of millions of Americans under the Graham-Cassidy proposal. This proposal would erode key protections for patients and consumers and does nothing to stabilize the insurance market now or in the long term,” the AHA said in a statement. —America's Essential Hospitals: “Policy changes must maintain coverage for those who have it, preserve access and protect hospitals that care for low-income and other vulnerable people. While we do not yet have a Congressional Budget Office score for the Graham-Cassidy proposal, the plan appears to violate those core principles,” the group said. —Six doctors’ groups that allied to oppose the BCRA are also staunchly opposed to Graham-Cassidy. They include the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Osteopathic Association and the American Psychiatric Association. Here’s what they said: “The proposal fails to protect the health care coverage and consumer protections available under current law.” —American Medical Association: “Unfortunately, the Graham-Cassidy Amendment … violates the precept of 'first do no harm’…we believe the Graham-Cassidy Amendment would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance coverage, destabilize health insurance markets, and decrease access to affordable coverage and care,” it said. —America’s Health Insurance Plans hasn’t taken a position on Graham-Cassidy, a spokeswoman told The Health 202. GOP GOVERNORS: Split. —Five Republican governors whose states expanded Medicaid signed a bipartisan letter in July opposing the “skinny repeal” bill. They included John Kasich of Ohio, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Larry Hogan of Maryland and Phil Scott of Vermont. Four of those Republicans (but not Hogan) signed a letter yesterday opposing Graham-Cassidy. Bill Walker of Alaska, an independent, signed it, too, along with five Democratic governors. They said senators should pursue a “bipartisan effort” to stabilize the marketplaces instead of legislation only Republicans support. “Only open, bipartisan approaches can achieve true, lasting reforms,” they wrote. Walker's opposition didn't prompt his state's Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, to swing against the bill (at least yet), The Post's Sean Sullivan noted: Even after their gov came out against, MURKOWSKI and SULLIVAN not saying they are out on repeal bill. Not in, either. Still mulling. It's interesting that Sandoval is against the bill, since Nevada Sen. Dean Heller is one of its co-sponsors. From a columnist at the Las Vegas Review Journal: In recent interview, @GovSandoval told me, I don't want the flexibility to make cuts. That's not flexibility to me."" A comment from former Kasich strategist"
Morning Bits,"Too bad he lacks spine. “The Republican Senate Health Committee Chairman is now downplaying the chance of crafting a bipartisan deal to stabilize the insurance markets, a nod to the chamber’s shift back toward partisan health care policies. ‘I know how to get bipartisan results,’ Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said. But ‘I’m not a magician, and it requires my persuading Sen. McConnell, Speaker Ryan, the president, that we’re right about it.’ ” Actually, it doesn’t. Make a deal, take a committee vote. You wish the president had the gumption to say the same, rather than cowering in front of Russian President Vladimir Putin. “President Donald Trump’s pick for US ambassador to Russia, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, told lawmakers Tuesday that there is ‘no question Russia interfered in the US election last summer.’ ” Do you think he has the nerve to tell Trump his speech was incoherent? “John Kelly spotted with his head in his hands, staring at the ground during Trump’s UN speech.” And yet Republican moderate senators may lack the backbone to oppose it. “Throughout this summer’s effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Republican senators outlined a treasury of specific provisions they needed to see tweaked, added or eliminated in order to win their support. The latest effort, from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy … addresses almost none of them.” Here is some bipartisan resolve. The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman and ranking Democrat do not appreciate Michael Cohen blabbing publicly. “We declined to move forward with today’s interview and will reschedule Mr. Cohen’s appearance before the Committee in open session at a date in the near future. The Committee expects witnesses in this investigation to work in good faith with the Senate.” Ten governors show mettle. They slam Cassidy-Graham: “Legislation should receive consideration under regular order, including hearings in health committees and input from the appropriate health-related parties.” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), call your office! McCain’s grit will be tested again, it seems. “The latest Trumpcare, known as Graham-Cassidy, risks the Senate’s credibility again. There has been none of the regular process that McCain demanded, not even a Congressional Budget Office analysis. No major medical group — not doctors, nurses, hospitals or advocates for the treatment of cancer, diabetes or birth defects — supports the bill. Passing it would violate every standard that McCain laid down. Yet Republican leaders are rushing toward a vote.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

An internal report undercut one of Trump's biggest goals. So the study was scrapped.,"THE MORNING PLUM: From the outset, the Trump administration has been infested by a deep rot of bad faith from top to bottom. We’ve seen it again and again: The administration pushes a new policy. Independent institutions provide facts and empirical analyses that completely undercut that policy’s stated rationale. Administration figures then ignore or suppress those facts. Or they push their own “alternative facts,” while deriding the real facts as fake. Or they mount a sustained effort to delegitimize the institution that provided them. Now the New York Times reports on the latest example of this, and in this case, the analysis in question comes from inside the administration itself: Trump administration officials, under pressure from the White House to provide a rationale for reducing the number of refugees allowed into the United States next year, rejected a study by the Department of Health and Human Services that found that refugees brought in $63 billion more in government revenues over the past decade than they cost. The draft report, which was obtained by The New York Times, contradicts a central argument made by advocates of deep cuts in refugee totals as President Trump faces an Oct. 1 deadline to decide on an allowable number. … The internal study, which was completed in late July but never publicly released, found that refugees “contributed an estimated $269.1 billion in revenues to all levels of government” between 2005 and 2014 through the payment of federal, state and local taxes. “Overall, this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10-year period, at $63 billion.” But White House officials said those conclusions were illegitimate and politically motivated, and were disproved by the final report issued by the agency, which asserts that the per-capita cost of a refugee is higher than that of an American. Strikingly, administration officials defend this by saying the analysis was faulty because it took into account the contributions that refugees make by paying taxes — something they dismiss as politically motivated. Instead, those officials say, it should have factored in only their cost in public services, and compared those costs to average native-born Americans. According to two sources who spoke to the Times, Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s hard-line anti-immigrant agenda, “personally intervened in the discussions on the refugee cap to ensure that only the costs — not any fiscal benefit — of the program were considered.” Miller, naturally, is a key advocate for dramatically cutting refugee flows. The Trump administration is debating whether to cut those flows from around 110,000 per year to below 50,000, and Miller has reportedly pushed for the number to be reduced to as low as 15,000. This must be viewed in its larger context, which is that virtually every major item in Trump’s immigration agenda has now been revealed to be thoroughly baseless. The rationale for Trump’s thinly veiled Muslim ban was blown apart by two leaked memos from inside the Department of Homeland Security — meaning this refugee analysis is not even the first time reports from inside the administration itself have been disregarded. When Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Trump’s decision to rescind protections for the “dreamers,” he offered as a policy rationale the notion that they are stealing jobs from Americans, but economists seriously contest this notion. One of Trump’s leading justifications for pushing a costly and expensive wall on the southern border is that it will stop drugs from pouring in, but experts say this is just nonsense. Trump has called for deep cuts in legal immigration, but his leading rationales are bogus: He claims that immigrants place “substantial pressure” on the wages of U.S. workers, which is mostly simplistic distortion and hyperbole, and he suggests that immigrants “immediately go and collect welfare” in a widespread sense, which is deeply misleading in multiple ways. And let’s not forget that senior White House officials attacked the media because it told the truth about Trump’s less-than-flattering inauguration crowd size, claiming not just that reporters were wrong on the facts (which they weren’t) but also that they were deliberately minimizing the crowd count. Or that former White House flack Sean Spicer “joked” to the press that in Trump’s view, good jobs numbers were fake under former president Barack Obama, but are “very real” when they flatter President Trump. Or that administration officials worked overtime to delegitimize the Congressional Budget Office because its findings undercut the administration’s lie that no one would be worse off under GOP Obamacare repeal proposals that Trump supported. This last one is of particular interest right now. Republicans are set to try and pass the new repeal bill — which is being championed by Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.) and Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) — through the Senate. But the Congressional Budget Office has announced that it will not be able to provide estimates of its projected coverage losses — which are likely to be huge — in time for the vote. Under usual circumstances, if the CBO put out numbers that undercut Trump — who is eager to sign anything that can be called repeal — administration officials would simply deride them as #FakeNews. In this case, they won’t have to deal with an inconvenient fact set at all. * INVESTIGATORS WIRETAPPED MANAFORT: CNN scoops that U.S. investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort before and after the election: The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump. Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, according to three sources familiar with the investigation. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive. Special bonus tidbit: Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s team has been “provided details of these communications.” Also note that, for this to happen, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court had to see grounds for authorizing the wiretap. * MUELLER IS RUNNING A ‘SHOCK AND AWE’ INVESTIGATION: The New York Times reports on the uncommonly aggressive tactics driving Mueller’s investigation, and notes that it is taking a very broad scope: Mr. Mueller’s team has used what some describe as shock-and-awe tactics to intimidate witnesses and potential targets of the inquiry. … He appears to be taking a broad view of his mandate: examining not just the Russian disruption campaign and whether any of Mr. Trump’s associates assisted in the effort, but also any financial entanglements with Russians going back several years. He is also investigating whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice when he fired James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director. Also: Interviews of White House officials will begin “soon,” and Mueller is “dispensing with the plodding pace typical of many white-collar investigations.” Things are about to get real. * WORLD LEADERS WILL WATCH ‘UNPREDICTABLE’ TRUMP ADDRESS U.N.: Trump gives his first address as president today to the United Nations General Assembly, and the Associated Press comments: Addressing the General Assembly is a milestone moment for any president, but one particularly significant for Trump … who has at times rattled the international community with his unpredictability. He has pulled the Unites States out of multinational agreements, considered shrinking the U.S. military footprint in the world and deployed bombastic language on North Korea that has been criticized by other world leaders. Trump frequently belittled the U.N. as a candidate. If Trump merely manages to refrain from scratching his armpits or giving his audience the middle finger, some idiot somewhere will declare that “this is the day Trump became president.” * A NEW BOOK ON TRUMP: Today is the release of “One Nation After Trump,” the new book by E.J. Dionne Jr., Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann. It’s a must-read on what Trump’s election and presidency really mean and what believers in liberal democracy can and should do right now. You can order it here. * HOUSE WILL PASS GRAHAM-CASSIDY, CONSERVATIVE SAYS: GOP Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the head of the “Freedom Caucus,” tells Politico that if the Senate passes Graham-Cassidy, the latest repeal bill, the House will pass it: “It’s fundamentally our last chance to make a legislative fix to Obamacare, and if it doesn’t happen, then the chances of it happening in the future are slim to none,” he said. “And so, I fully expect that if it makes it out of the Senate, the pressure will be so great — from moderates to conservatives — to get it passed.” If this is correct, it basically means that this is the last chance: If the Senate passes this, the Affordable Care Act is toast. * BUT IT’S NOT A SLAM DUNK IN THE HOUSE: The Post’s Mike DeBonis points out that Graham-Cassidy hits big states that expanded Medicaid particularly hard, and adds: The bigger obstacle may be House moderates — particularly from the states of California and New York, which stand to lose tens of billions of dollars in federal health-care funding under the Graham-Cassidy framework. … 21 GOP lawmakers from California and New York voted for the American Health Care Act in May, and a threshold question for considering Graham-Cassidy’s prospects is … how many of them will … vote to blow a hole in their state’s health-care budget. Republicans would never dream of voting against the interests of their states or constituents! Oh, wait… * COLLINS IS ‘CONCERNED’ ABOUT GRAHAM-CASSIDY: Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) is sounding a very sour note about the Graham-Cassidy repeal bill: “I’m concerned about what the effect would be on coverage; on Medicaid spending in my state; on the fundamental changes in Medicaid that would be made without the Senate holding a single hearing to evaluate them; and also on what the effect would be on premiums, particularly for older Americans between 50 and 64,” she said. This should be an easy call. Collins opposed all the previous repeal bills in part because of their deep cuts to Medicaid, which she expressed deep qualms about. Graham-Cassidy does the same. * AND WILL McCAIN SELL OUT HIS PRINCIPLES? David Leonhardt reminds us of the July floor speech on the need for regular order that won Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) so much acclaim, and notes that consistency would require him to vote against Graham-Cassidy: The latest Trumpcare, known as Graham-Cassidy, risks the Senate’s credibility again. There has been none of the regular process that McCain demanded, not even a Congressional Budget Office analysis. No major medical group — not doctors, nurses, hospitals or advocates for the treatment of cancer, diabetes or birth defects — supports the bill. Passing it would violate every standard that McCain laid down. If McCain votes for Graham-Cassidy, the accolades showered upon him will look pretty foolish in retrospect.

Deja vu on Trumpcare,"If you thought the Senate already beat back a bill that would slash federal support for the health-care exchanges, end Medicaid as we know it, undermine the minimum set of benefits insurers must offer and remove the guarantee on coverage for those with preexisting conditions, you’re right. You thought Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) rejected a bill that was entirely partisan and rammed through without regular order? Right again. You thought the Senate disparaged the House for voting on its own health-care bill without a complete score from the Congressional Budget Office? You’re three for three. So why is a bill with all those infirmities and a few more getting teed up for a vote before the clock strikes midnight on Sept, 30, ending the fiscal year and the Senate’s chance to do this by reconciliation? Cassidy-Graham is such a poor piece of legislation that its sponsors have resorted to citing misleading statistics to justify their effort. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found: In rolling out their revised bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Senators Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham released estimates purporting to show that most states would see large funding gains under their proposal. But these estimates do not compare states’ funding under the proposal to what states would receive under current law, the relevant comparison. Instead, they show how each state’s funding under the proposed block grant would change over time. In reality, the Cassidy-Graham plan would cut federal funding for coverage programs by about $80 billion in 2026 compared to current law, leading to cuts in most states, and would cut federal funding by about $300 billion in 2027, with funding cuts in all states. … By 2027, every state would see large, damaging cuts in federal funding. The bill’s sponsors are also trying to hide the ball on its “per capita cap” on federal funding of Medicaid, leaving this substantial change out of the bill’s projections.  In fact, with the caps, the Medicaid cut “would rise from an already deep $80 billion in 2026 to about $300 billion in 2027, with commensurate increases in cuts for individual states.” There is no logical reason then that Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and McCain would suddenly decide they are fine with massive Medicaid cuts and a partisan rush to judgment. But yet, Graham (R-S.C.), Cassidy (R-La.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) are trying it again, maybe hoping their three colleagues are fickle and will go for it this time. It does not even have the sop of billions for opioid abuse treatment that got Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) to go along with the “skinny repeal” last time. (Imagine Portman having to explain why he sold opioid abuse patients down the river.) Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) went to the floor on Monday with special focus on these very senators: My colleagues should know the effect of the bill, they don’t. CBO has told us that they cannot give us a full score, but simply note whether it meets the budget reconciliation. It’ll say, ‘it’ll cut a billion dollars.” That’s all it will say. We won’t know how many citizens are hurt. But Center for Budget and Policy Priorities whose numbers are very, very reliable has done a calculation. I would ask my colleagues to pay attention. I’ve just picked out some states; there are more. Arizona would lose $1.6 billion in federal funding; Alaska would lose $255 million in federal funding; Maine would lose $115 million in federal funding; West Virginia would lose $554 million in federal funding; Colorado would lose $823 million in federal funding; Ohio, a state most wracked by the opioid epidemic, would lose over $2.5 billion in health care funding; and Iowa would lose $525 million in federal funding. He also pointed out that voting for this would undercut the sole bipartisan effort underway at the time. “Senator Alexander, Senator Murray have had hearings, they’ve had discussion. They’re negotiating it this moment,” Schumer said. He added, “It’s not to rush a bill through in the dark of night without even knowledge of how it affects people, because now CBO has said they cannot measure how many people would lose coverage and how people would be affected until a few weeks because this is a block grant, it takes a long time to weigh it.” (CBO said it will have some kind of preliminary score next week, but the bill’s impact on coverage will take weeks to develop.) McCain wasn’t fooled. On Monday, he decried the process again. “It’s better but it’s not what the Senate is supposed to be doing. … Is it better to be guilty of murder or train robbery? … I’m not the one that waited nine months … it’s not my problem that we only have those few days.” I suppose the three co-sponsors think McCain doesn’t mean what he says. Collins also released a statement. “I have a number of concerns with the Graham-Cassidy proposal, including the fundamental changes to the Medicaid program, the effect on premiums for older Americans, and the fact that the bill could allow insurers to charge higher premiums for people with pre-existing conditions,” she said. She vowed to examine carefully the CBO analysis. She doesn’t seem likely to be snookered into supporting this bill either. Returning to our original question — why is the Senate even toying with this? One explanation is that scared of Trump’s foray with Democrats, the Republicans are trying to get back in his good graces with one more try at health care. (But if they fail again, doesn’t that get Trump all worked up again?) It might also be that Republicans imagine this is actually a “hard” vote for red-state Democrats and want them to vote again. Senate and House tax plan negotiators may also have discovered that they cannot square the numbers for big tax cuts without the added revenue from cutting Medicaid. (Yes, they contemplate big cuts to Medicaid that will help pay for tax cuts for the rich and for corporations.) Then again, they may imagine their colleagues who opposed the previous version of Trumpcare are so dense and insincere that they’ll cave to the Trumpian base this time around. (If the latter, we don’t yet know whether they are right.) Whatever the motive, it is the worst sort of legislation — thoughtless, partisan, cynical and injurious to the most vulnerable in our society. Cassidy is a doctor by trade — did he not learn Hippocrates’s medical directive “First, do no harm”? Maybe the GOP as a whole should start adopting that principle.

The Trumpcare zombie is back from the dead. And here come the same old lies.,"THE MORNING PLUM: For many months, President Trump and Republicans tried to sell Obamacare repeal proposals that would have cut hundreds of billions of dollars in health spending on poor and working people — by peddling all sorts of creative lies about how those cuts wouldn’t actually end up hurting the many millions who would lose coverage as a result. Those efforts failed. But now Trump and Republicans are back with one final effort to repeal Obamacare. And in so doing, they will try to sell a proposal that would cut hundreds of billions of dollars in health spending on poor and working people  — by peddling all sorts of creative lies about how those cuts wouldn’t actually end up hurting the many millions who would lose coverage as a result. Anyone else notice a pattern here? This time, however, it just might work. But for that to happen, a handful of moderate GOP senators would have to support the bill in a way that would reveal their previous vociferous moral objections to GOP repeal efforts as entirely hollow. The Post reports that Senate Republicans are planning a major push this week to see whether they can get 50 votes for the repeal bill created by Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). Politico reports that Trump and the White House will try to build support for it. The Graham-Cassidy bill would get rid of the Medicaid expansion and subsidies for lower-income people starting in 2020 and replace them with block grants to the states, which could use that money to cover people in a variety of other ways. But as an analysis by the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, the result would be very deep cuts to the Affordable Care Act’s historic coverage expansion. There are two reasons for this. CBPP concludes that the overall spending on the block grants would add up to hundreds of billions of dollars less between 2020 and 2026 than would be spent on Medicaid and subsidies under current law. As Jonathan Cohn puts it: “Cassidy-Graham would shrink the federal investment in health care programs dramatically.” Second, because of Graham-Cassidy’s funding formula, it would redistribute funds from states that have expanded Medicaid to ones that haven’t, penalizing the states that have tried to make the law work for them. This would end up costing a lot of Republican states that expanded Medicaid. As Axios points out, the three Republican senators who helped sink the “skinny repeal” bill last time — Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and John McCain (Ariz.) — all come from states that would lose out under the bill. You’d think that voting for Graham-Cassidy should also be a very heavy lift for other Republican moderates from states that expanded Medicaid, such as Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and Rob Portman (Ohio). Their states, too, would lose out. What’s more, most of these senators, including Collins, Murkowski, Capito and Portman, originally expressed strong moral opposition to the original GOP repeal bills precisely because of their deep Medicaid cuts. And now we are going to find out whether they meant what they said. Once the big push for Graham-Cassidy starts, you’ll hear the same old nonsense about how no one will lose out under the bill; how everyone will have “access” to coverage; and how the states will now have more “flexibility” to better address their coverage needs. Indeed, that last talking point is already being employed. But as Cohn notes, what this really means is that states could redirect their block grant money away from covering poor people, and toward other goals, and the bottom line is that substantially cutting spending means that people — a lot of people — will lose coverage. The grand health-care debate of 2017 revealed a meaningful divide between Republicans who want government to spend money to expand coverage to people who are too poor and sick to afford it, and those who want to roll back most or all of that spending. That divide was papered over for years, as Republicans could call for repeal without it actually happening. But once repeal loomed as a reality, a few Republicans revealed themselves to be unwilling to go through with it, precisely because that rollback of spending would have inflicted an unacceptable outcome on millions who stood to lose coverage. Once the Congressional Budget Office weighs in on Graham-Cassidy, we will have a clearer sense of the magnitude of the coverage loss this latest effort would bring about. And we will once again find out whether those Republicans who claimed to oppose such an outcome meant what they said. * MUELLER INTENSIFIES FOCUS ON TRUMP TEAM’S LYING: The New York Times reports that Trump’s lawyers, White House counsel Donald McGahn and outside counsel Ty Cobb, are feuding over how cooperative to be amid special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s probe. Note: Mr. McGahn himself is a likely witness. Mr. Mueller wants to interview him about [FBI director James] Comey’s dismissal and the White House’s handling of questions about a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer said to be offering incriminating information about Hillary Clinton. Mr. McGahn is willing to … answer questions, but his lawyer, Bill Burck, has asked Mr. Cobb to tell him whether the president wants to assert either attorney-client or executive privilege, according to lawyers close to the case. Trump himself had a hand in the statement that lied to the United States about that meeting. When your lawyers are lawyered up, you know things will get rocky. * TRUMP’S UGLINESS IS DRIVING AWAY CUSTOMERS: The Post reports that Mar-a-Lago is on track to have its slowest season in nearly a decade: Trump’s properties are attracting new customers who want something from him or his government. But they’re losing the kind of customers the business was originally built on: nonpolitical groups who just wanted to rent a room. … Before this year, many longtime Trump clients said they would return to use his clubs again — believing that quitting a Trump club would be a political act. Now, as Trump’s presidency has grown more polarizing, some customers say they see it as a political act to stay. Trump’s use of the presidency to promote Mar-a-Lago is being outweighed by the degree to which his racism and ugliness are driving customers away. Sad! * MAJORITY DOESN’T TRUST TRUMP ON NORTH KOREA: A new NPR-Ipsos poll finds that 51 percent of Americans don’t trust Trump to handle the North Korea threat, vs. 44 percent who do trust him. Note this: The president has unilateral authority to launch a nuclear strike — a fact that surprises many Americans. Only about a quarter of the people surveyed know that Trump can order a strike on his own authority. Most incorrectly think he needs to get Congress’ approval. One big campaign issue was whether Trump could be trusted to handle nukes. One wonders how that debate might have played out if more people understood the president’s authority over them. * REPUBLICANS FEAR ‘SENATOR ROY MOORE’: Politico reports that Senate Republicans are dreading the possibility that religious-right candidate Roy Moore might actually beat establishment pick Luther Strange in the Sept. 26 Alabama Senate runoff: Moore could cause GOP leaders grief by aligning himself with a conservative bloc of senators, or go rogue by placing holds on legislation and nominees, employing the enormous powers that individual senators possess. … Other Republicans worry that a Moore victory would embolden other conservative challenges to other incumbents. If Moore wins, look for former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon to seize on that to argue that other challengers should also try to oust GOP senators. * WILL COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI HOLD THE LINE ON REPEAL? Graham-Cassidy would end the Medicaid expansion and replace it with block grants to states, which would punish states that used the ACA to help their residents. E.J. Dionne Jr. explains what this should mean: This should make the bill impossible for two brave Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who stood up against July’s repeal effort. Both have said they would not be complicit in undermining health-care coverage in their states. And the bill would, in fact, undermine coverage in their states. The question is whether these two — and John McCain, who has insisted on a return to regular order — will remain consistent. * HOW REPEAL COULD STILL PASS: Paul Krugman reminds us that it was public outrage and activism that blocked the last GOP repeal efforts, and notes: The news cycle has moved on, taking public attention with it. Many progressives have already begun taking Obamacare’s achievements for granted, and are moving on from protest against right-wing schemes to dreams of single-payer. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the kind of environment in which swing senators, no longer in the spotlight, might be bribed or bullied into voting for a truly terrible bill. And all Republicans need is one of the three who voted against repeal last time — or perhaps two, if Rand Paul votes no, as he has been threatening to do, though I wouldn’t count on that — to flip. * HOW TRUMP’S ADVISERS ARE SCHOOLING HIM ON THE WORLD: The Associated Press has a fascinating look at how Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis privately schooled Trump on the need for American military engagement abroad: To be successful, Mattis and Tillerson decided they should use talking points and commentary with which they believed Trump would be most familiar: the role that the military, intelligence officers and diplomats play in making the world safe for American businesses, like The Trump Organization, to operate and expand abroad. American troops provide stability, diplomats push rule of law and anti-corruption measures and the intelligence community provides context and analysis that drive the first two, the briefers explained. No doubt studding these presentations with references to the greatness of Trump’s international business ventures would also help to hold his attention.

The Health 202: The new GOP Obamacare repeal effort faces the same old math,"THE PROGNOSIS Senators pushing a last-ditch Obamacare repeal effort this week are up against the same old problem: math. This small group of Republicans — led by Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham — appear convinced they can rework the equation to secure  that ever-elusive 50th vote for their measure, finally passing a bill overhauling the Affordable Care Act with a tiebreaking vote from Vice President Pence and moving closer to their goal of repealing and replacing President Barack Obama’s health-care law. There will be a lot of moving parts to watch this week. Republicans have asked the Congressional Budget Office to rush a score of the Graham-Cassidy bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) office confirmed yesterday. McConnell plans to take the temperature of his leadership team and his entire conference over the next few days. They have only two weeks left to scrape together enough support, since the budget reconciliation bill they’re using expires at the end of the month. But despite all the noise being generated on Capitol Hill, Cassidy and Co. still appear to be shy of the vote total they’d need to succeed. Cassidy says he’s certain they have 48 or 49 Republican votes for his bill. But getting that final, 50th vote is the crucial -- and the hardest -- part. Cassidy has sorta, kinda, maybe won over Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who said this month that he favors this latest approach but wanted to see actual text first. McCain is a key figure in all of this, since he cast the third vote in July bringing down a “skinny repeal” bill. But McCain has also continually expressed frustration at passing a health-care bill entirely along partisan lines — and he reiterated that concern on CBS’s “Face the Nation” yesterday. “Why did — why did Obamacare fail?” McCain said. “Obamacare was rammed through with Democrats' votes only. That's not the way to do it.” McCain spokeswoman Julie Tarallo told me the senator is continuing to ""review"" the text Cassidy introduced last week. ""Senator McCain continues to review the bill to assess its impact on the people of Arizona"
The Daily 202: The reading list that helped Hillary Clinton cope,"Hillary Clinton signs copies of her new book, What Happened"
Sessions forced Trump into his dumbest political move yet,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions apparently convinced President Trump he had no choice but to pull the plug on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, using a phony deadline as the pretext. Stephen K. Bannon and the alt-right may think this was a terrific idea, but the polls say otherwise — as does Trump’s newfound interest in finding a fix to his own political malpractice. According to a new Morning Consult/Politico poll, 65 percent of voters think that “passing a bill that grants young people who were brought to the United States illegally when they were children, often with their parents, protection from deportation” should be a top or at least important priority.  A plurality (45 percent) think ending DACA was wrong. Asked “When it comes to legislation regarding Dreamers, which of the following would you most like Congress to pass?” 54 percent say they want dreamers “to stay and become citizens if they meet certain requirements” while an additional 19 percent want to afford them legal residence. That includes 41 percent of Republicans who voted for Trump. Only 12 percent want to deport them. Repealing DACA looks like it’s even less popular than Trumpcare. In addition, a plurality (45 percent) think a DACA fix should be a stand-alone bill while only a third think it should be part of a larger immigration package. The DACA repeal therefore has done several things, none of them helpful to the anti-immigrant crowd. First, it has galvanized sympathy for dreamers to such an extent that a significant majority now want them to be citizens. Second, it has made Trump as anxious about passing a DACA fix as Democrats are. He’s so concerned, the White House already threw in the towel on tying it to funding for the wall. In all likelihood, DACA will be fixed and the wall will never be built. It’s a result Hillary Clinton might not have been able to obtain (certainly not with a GOP House and Senate). Third, Trump’s decision will force a good number of Republicans to cast votes for the Dream Act (or some variation), thereby emphasizing the split between the Bannonites and the rest of the GOP. This offers traditional Republicans an opportunity to rebuke the ethno-nationalist agenda (oddly, with Trump’s help) but puts anti-immigrant but pro-Trump lawmakers (e.g., Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas) in a precarious position. No one should consider a DACA fix to be a small or insignificant part of the immigration problem. About 1.9 million people were eligible for DACA — more than 17 percent of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. About 788,000 successfully applied for DACA status, about 7 percent of the illegal immigrant population. Taking care of dreamers, without giving up much of anything, would be a huge win for the pro-immigrant community. Getting Americans to think of immigrants as assets, not burdens, and certainly not as a bunch of “murderers,” as Trump described them, would represent an important precursor to a humane, reasonable immigration solution that takes care of those already here, provides workable border and visa overstay-prevention and reform of our legal immigration system (not slashing of legal immigration, an immensely stupid and destructive proposal). It would be what the die-hard anti-immigrant groups used to call “amnesty.” And it will be largely due to the handiwork of Jeff Sessions.

Democrats are rushing to embrace single payer. Can it be a political winner?,"One of the most important political trends of the last couple of decades is what is often referred to as “asymmetric polarization,” which means that while Democrats were getting more liberal, Republicans were getting much, much more conservative. That trend, however, may be entering a new phase. In many policy areas, it’s almost impossible for the GOP to get any more conservative than it has become, while Democrats are continuing to move left. Nowhere is this clearer than on health care. The experience of the last decade — the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the political challenges of its implementation, and the failed Republican effort to repeal it and replace it with a spectacularly unpopular plan moving government out of the business of helping people get coverage — has brought about a new boldness among Democrats. While some of us have been predicting for a few months that support for some version of single-payer health care would gradually become the default position for those seeking the 2020 presidential nomination — and thus for the party as a whole — it’s happening faster than one might have thought. A bunch of potential candidates, including Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, and Kamala Harris, have moved from their previous position — a somewhat vague support of single payer in the abstract — to becoming co-sponsors of Bernie Sanders’s single-payer bill, which is set to be released this week. Today Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, who’s up for reelection next year, added her name to the list, and so did Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, joining a number of others. A single-payer bill in the House is co-sponsored by more than half the Democratic caucus (though House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California is notably holding off). This is a significant change in Democratic Party orthodoxy. Can it help Democrats politically? The answer is yes, it can — but it’s complicated. For starters, it would be better if we referred not to “single payer” but to “universal coverage,” since the latter is the real goal, while the former is just one way to achieve that goal (see Harold Pollack for more on this). One big question about Sanders’s plan is whether it will be the kind of “Medicare for all” he’s advocated in the past, or something like “Medicare for all who want it,” which would retain a role for private insurance. There are multiple paths to universal coverage, and no one who is serious about the complex policy questions involved believes that a true single-payer plan is the only way to get a system that does what we want it to. But that reality may be powerless in the face of the fact that “single payer” is a slogan that people are already rallying around. In any case, the first thing Democrats have to acknowledge is that if this is going to be their goal, they have a challenging persuasion task ahead of them. Most voters don’t really understand what single payer is and haven’t thought much about it, mostly because it’s only now emerging as a topic of mainstream debate. That makes public opinion on the question extremely fluid. Polls tell us something about how receptive the public might be to a single-payer plan, but they also demonstrate that they can be easily swayed in either direction. Take, for instance, this Kaiser Family Foundation poll from July. It found 53 percent of respondents saying they’d support “a national health plan, or a single payer plan, in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan.” That’s quite encouraging to liberals, but when they offered some reasons one might oppose it (it would give government too much control, it would require new taxes), support dropped to as low as 34 percent. On the other hand, when they offered reasons to support single payer (it would guarantee universal coverage, it would save administrative costs), support climbed as high as 72 percent. That tells us that it’s impossible to know for sure how a debate over single payer will turn out. One thing we can say, however, is that Democrats probably don’t need to be too paralyzed by fear of the inevitable Republican charge that it would represent big government controlling your life. As Republicans discovered when they tried to kick millions of people off Medicaid and undermine the program, the American public is perfectly fine with the government helping to give people health coverage. Medicare and Medicaid are both extremely popular with their recipients, who in total now number about 130 million. That doesn’t mean the public isn’t still receptive to arguments about big government. But it does mean they can be refuted. Nevertheless, there are other arguments Republicans will make in opposition that could be persuasive, including that a single-payer plan would require a big tax increase, and that it would disrupt the system in ways that might leave some people worse off even if many more people benefit. Democrats should invest time and resources in figuring out the best way to counter those arguments, especially since we know all too well how much people fear change when it comes to their health care. But single payer offers Democrats something extremely powerful: an ambitious policy change that will motivate their own voters to haul themselves to the polls. Saying that the other side is terrible is important and often true (particularly right now), but experience has shown that if you want to really get your voters to the polls, at least in presidential elections, they have to have an affirmative reason to get excited. That comes from the personality of the candidate, but it also comes from their vision of change. Whether they were right or not, in 2016 Democrats didn’t perceive Hillary Clinton as offering a sweeping policy agenda; she seemed more interested in tinkering with every program to make it work better. Even if that’s a big part of what was needed, it doesn’t make for a stirring campaign. That gets to an important thing that a big goal like universal coverage can accomplish for Democrats, who are often accused of being too focused on small-bore policy change. It sends a message to voters that goes beyond health care, saying something about who Democrats are, what’s important to them, and what their vision of the future is. It says that they want to deploy government to solve problems and improve people’s lives, stepping in where the free market has failed to remove uncertainty and create conditions for everyone to thrive. And it establishes a clear contrast with the status quo. Democrats need to keep in mind that they’re setting out on a long road. Even if they’re ultimately successful and we achieve universal health coverage in America, getting there will take years and the debate will have many ups and downs. It’s good to see them rallying around an ambitious idea for positive change. But achieving it is going to require all the skill and persistence they can muster.

The Health 202: Immigrants' health-care problems are about to get worse,"THE PROGNOSIS Young immigrants and supporters walk holding signs during a rally in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) in Los Angeles, Calif. on Sept. 1. (AFP PHOTO / FREDERIC J. BROWN) The Prognosis is guest hosted today by The Fix's Amber Phillips. Paige will return next week. “Dreamers” may soon lose their security to go about their daily lives and not be deported. But these 800,000 young adults who came here illegally as children have never had health-care security. When it protected them from deportations, the Obama administration blocked dreamers from participating in the health-care marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act, to the dismay of immigration rights advocates. And dreamers' health-care insecurity is a microcosm of all immigrants' health-care problems. The 23 million immigrants who aren't citizens — which includes the 11 million who are undocumented — are significantly more likely to be uninsured than U.S. citizens. That's according to a July Kaiser Family Foundation report that found immigrants in the country legally are twice as likely to be uninsured than U.S. citizens. Undocumented immigrants are four times as likely to be uninsured than U.S. citizens. In short, immigrants play a big role in driving up the nation's uninsured rate. And immigration advocates fear that Trump's decision Tuesday to limit dreamers' rights by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is only going to exacerbate immigrants’ insurance problem. “It's not easy to overstate the level of fear and anxiety among immigrants and their families right now,” said Matthew Lopas, a health policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, which advocates for immigrant rights. Some people are afraid to leave their homes"
Three cheers for eight governors on health-care reform,"In a fog of dysfunction, acrimony and ignorance that surrounds the health-care “debate” in Washington, a flicker of light could be seen yesterday in the form of a letter signed by eight governors (two Republicans, five Democrats and one Independent). Led by Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R), the group recommended a health-care package. They explained: Continuing uncertainty about the direction of federal policy is driving up premiums, eliminating competition, and leaving consumers with fewer choices. Proposed premiums for the most popular exchange plans are expected to increase 18 percent in 2018 and 2.5 million residents in 1,400 counties will have only one carrier available to them on the exchange. Despite these headwinds, states continue to try to stabilize the individual market and have developed innovative solutions to preserve coverage while making insurance more affordable. … Based on these guiding principles, we recommend (1) immediate federal action to stabilize markets, (2) responsible reforms that preserve recent coverage gains and control costs, and (3) an active federal/state partnership that is based on innovation and a shared commitment to improve overall health system performance. Just as these proposals have brought together governors from across the political spectrum, we are confident they can attract support across party lines in both chambers of Congress. Included in their package were items such as a commitment that “should put to rest any uncertainty about the future of [cost-sharing reduction] payments by explicitly appropriating federal funding for these payments at least through 2019”; a federal reinsurance fund to help stabilize premiums and deductibles; and increasing outreach efforts to sign up younger, healthier Americans (the Trump administration is sabotaging the system by cutting advertising for sign-ups by 90 percent). Those items should please many Democrats. On the reform front that may please Republicans, the governors suggest allowing states more flexibility in choosing essential health benefits (EHB). (“The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) should allow states more flexibility in choosing reference plans for the ten EHB categories than are currently allowed by regulation. HHS should give states that develop alternatives to EHBs that meet the requirements of Section 1332 of the [Affordable Care Act] the opportunity to pursue and implement innovative approaches.”) The plan includes all sort of ideas on easing the process for state waivers (which still abide by basic ACA requirements) and payment innovation. For now, the governors agree that the individual mandate should stay in place. Hey, how come no one consulted these guys, who seem to know an awful lot about health care? Republicans, in short, were so set on ripping out Obamacare and so ignorant of the consequences of their actions that they wanted no hearings, no methodical negotiations and no bipartisanship. Well, that didn’t work out so well. Without getting into the weeds of the idea, Jared Bernstein, former chief economist for Vice President Joe Biden and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told me on Thursday, “Their proposals to stabilize the private insurance market through steady CSR payments, reinsurance, and commitment to the individual mandate make a lot of sense and should be an easy bipartisan play in this space.” Likewise, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who introduced his own plan in June, had a positive reaction to the plan. “The plan proposed by Governors Kasich and Hickenlooper is a positive example of how bipartisan teamwork can move the needle on health care,” he said. “What they’ve offered is a constructive solution to improve the individual health insurance market and reduce health care costs. This bipartisan plan includes funding for cost-sharing reduction payments for two years and, similarly to legislation I introduced earlier this year and Republican health care plans, calls for a stability fund to strengthen the individual insurance markets.” He added: “For months, I’ve been urging my colleagues in Congress to give our governors a seat at the table and a voice in the health care debate. I look forward to hearing more from our governors in the coming weeks.” That sounds an awful lot like what Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said in The Post, imploring his colleagues once again to “return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts” and rediscover the value of “compromise between opposing sides to protect the interests we share.” (As he notes, that is especially crucial since the president “has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.”) The governors’ plan may have flaws or omissions; reasonable centrists on each side may have additions. But perhaps it is time for a mini-revolt against the mindlessness exhibited by Republican leaders and the White House, on one side, and the left flank of the Democrats on the other. The combination of centrist Republicans and large numbers of Democrats can produce something that is, if not perfect, at least sane and helpful. Put it on President Trump’s desk, bless it as “Trumpcare” and let him take a victory lap. He won’t know or care what’s in it.

"On taxes, George W. Bush sounded more populist than Trump","Plenty of presidential rhetoric is forgettable, and President Trump's speech on tax reform may be forgotten by next week. By offering few specifics about what a reform package needed to include, Trump left analysts with little to talk about. (“A broad-brush opening pitch” was the Wall Street Journal's diplomatic description.) By plowing ahead with the speech despite the news coming out of the Gulf Coast, Trump saw himself relegated to half the screen on Fox News and MSNBC; CNN didn't even cover his speech live. The most interesting aspect of the speech, in fact, might be how little attention was paid to describing how tax cuts could benefit most taxpayers. For all the run-up talk about how Trump was pivoting back to “populism,” and how he would describe reform as a way to “un-rig”* the economy, Trump said less about gains for average taxpayers than George W. Bush did when he successfully sold his 2001 tax cuts. It's worth contrasting the two approaches — one of which, obviously, paid off. Today, Trump spent just 248 words discussing “tax relief for middle class families.” He did so with very few details, and with digressions about his daughter, Ivanka, and about his campaign baseball cap. The third principle for tax reform is a crucial one: tax relief for middle-class families. In a way — and I've been saying this for a long time — they've been, sort of, the forgotten people. But they're not forgotten any longer, I can tell you that. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. And they can do lots of things with those paychecks. And that really means buying product — ideally made in this country. But that means they'll go out and they'll spend their money. And it will be a beautiful thing to watch. This includes helping parents afford child care and the cost of raising a family. That's so important to Ivanka Trump. Very, very important to everybody in this room, but so important to my daughter. It's one of her real big beliefs and she's very committed to that. Right, Ivanka? We believe that ordinary Americans know better than Washington how to spend their own money and we want to help them take home as much of their money as possible and then spend it. So they'll keep their money, they'll spend their money, they'll buy our products, our factories will be moving again, companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country is going to be just like it says on that beautiful red hat. It says “Make America Great Again.” That's what we're going to do. Even if you were listening closely, it was completely unclear what “middle-class families” were going to get. Helping them afford child-care, for example, would mean helping them defray costs that run families thousands of dollars every month. (In Washington, the average family with child care pays around $2,500 monthly.) Would they be getting hundreds of dollars back? Thousands? Who can say! Compare this with the aggressive sales pitch that George W. Bush used to pitch his first round of tax cuts. In his first address to Congress, Bush told several stories to describe the most needful beneficiaries of tax cuts — the working class. A typical family with two children will save $1,600 a year on their federal income taxes. Now, $1,600 may not sound like a lot to some, but it means a lot to many families: $1,600 buys gas for two cars for an entire year; it pays tuition for a year at a community college; it pays the average family grocery bill for three months. That's real money. Anyone who covered the tax cut debate could point out some flimflam here. What's a “typical family?” How much is the average cut distorted by the cuts for higher earners? Bush tucked that information inside a couple of memorable examples — the cost of gas and tuition. Bush went on to describe a hokey, but effective, appeal for help from two voters from the important swing state of Pennsylvania. Again, there was a concise story about how much money they'd save. Steven and Josefina tell me they pay almost $8,000 a year in federal income taxes. My plan will save them more than $2,000. Let me tell you what Steven says: “Two thousand dollars a year means a lot to my family. If we had this money, it would help us reach our goal of paying off our personal debt in 2 years' time.” After that, Steven and Josefina want to start saving for Lianna's college education. Again, there was a personal story — even a quote — about how much people would benefit from tax cuts. Bush did this all the time. The month after the joint address, he gave a speech in Michigan that dealt specifically with the debt 25 million families” were carrying"
Cory Gardner has a choice: Voters or Trump?,"Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) ran in 2014 as a reform-minded, inclusive Republican (now an oxymoron). He successfully beat back the “war on women” charge from Democrats. He nevertheless turned out to be a political lemming — yes on endorsing Donald Trump’s candidacy (until the “Access Hollywood” tape); yes on denying Merrick Garland a confirmation vote; yes on President Trump’s extreme and unqualified nominees (only the U.S. trade representative [!] nominee drew a no vote); and yes on Trumpcare, including a one-year ban on Planned Parenthood funding. When he returned home this week, he got an angry reception. The Denver Post reported: Months of frustration with U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner and the GOP boiled over Tuesday as the Republican faced his constituents across the Front Range in his first in-person, solo town halls in more than a year. The GOP strongholds of Greeley and Colorado Springs offered hostile questions about health care and President Donald Trump’s rhetoric toward North Korea. A crowd of about 1,000 in Lakewood was so loud that Gardner’s answers were rarely audible over their roar. . . . Asked about Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and adviser Sebastian Gorka, Gardner said he wouldn’t tell the president to fire any of his staff — which displeased many. He also defended Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, another Trump pick, by highlighting his trip earlier this month to the Gold King Mine, in southwest Colorado, and the promises he made there. Gardner’s comments rebutting Trump’s moral equivalence on Charlottesville fell short of denouncing the president. ““We can’t let people think that somebody who believes in the KKK or white supremacy is part of any base. . . . Why we have a 20-year-old neo-Nazi in this country,  I don’t know,” he said. One reason would be that the GOP elected a neo-Nazi sympathizer who spews his venom while Gardner and others treat him like just another GOP president. When the hard questions come, Gardner shows no moral leadership: “Are you confident that Donald Trump is fit to lead this country? Yes or no?” asked a Jewish man who said he was unnerved by the demonstrations of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. “The people of this country elected Donald Trump,” Gardner said to an eruption of anger, adding that he does believe Trump is fit for office. Really, he thinks a man who coddles neo-Nazis is fit to lead a diverse, democratic country? He trusts this president with nuclear weapons? Gardner is not on the ballot until 2020 so perhaps Colorado voters will forget his spineless behavior and failure, for example, to call for congressional hearings and action on Trump’s potential conflicts of interest and Emoluments Clause violation, for his failure to put his constituents (especially the most vulnerable) above mindless party loyalty and for going along with Trump’s anti-immigrant and criminal-justice agendas that disproportionately hurt minorities. In  three years, no one will say in his defense, “But Cory Gardner was privately upset so he gets a pass!” or “But Cory Gardner made empty public statements after Charlottesville!” It is because of passive, cowering Republicans such as Gardner that Trump feels confident he can ride out his term. Gardner is the quintessential decent man who refused to interpose himself between an abhorrent leader and his country. Gardner has sacrificed his integrity and betrayed the confidence voters place in him to be an independent-minded voice. And for what? His reputation has suffered, his profile has fallen. It’s Gardner’s moral absenteeism that reminds all voters how unworthy of office are Trump  and his go-along Republicans. Anti-Trump Republicans and Democrats should get ready for 2020 — they can and should have the chance to knock him out of office.

Why Trump’s poll numbers are still in free fall,"Gallup reports: “President Donald Trump’s job approval rating in Gallup Daily tracking is at 34% for the three-day period from Friday through Sunday — by one point the lowest of his administration so far.” Even worse, his support among Republicans is low by usual standards: The president has talked in recent days about doing well with his “base,” but Republicans’ latest weekly approval rating of 79% was the lowest from his own partisans so far, dropping from the previous week’s 82%. Democrats gave Trump a 7% job approval rating last week, while the reading for independents was at 29%. This is the first time independents’ weekly approval rating for Trump has dropped below 30%. [Trump’s lasting legacy is to embolden an entirely new generation of racists] We can speculate as to why he’s dropping so precipitously. There is the failure on health-care reform, the Russia investigation, the spate of firings and continued dysfunction inside the White House, the bullying of his attorney general, his bombast directed to North Korea and, most recently, his handling of the Charlottesville violence and reluctance to condemn white nationalists. His aberrant, unpresidential behavior in responding to North Korea shouldn’t be ignored. The Marist poll tells us: Americans want the United States government to diffuse heightened tensions surrounding North Korea’s nuclear programs through diplomatic means and not military intervention. 76% of residents say the U.S. should either negotiate directly with North Korea, 39%, or convince China to use their influence to stop North Korea’s nuclear programs, 37%. Only 11% think the United States should employ air strikes to destroy North Korea’s nuclear facilities, and 4% believe the U.S. should launch a first strike nuclear attack. Two percent of Americans say troops should be deployed to overthrow the government. … While President Donald Trump’s base is confident in his ability to lead the nation during an international crisis, more than six in ten U.S. residents, 61%, lack faith in the president’s ability to do so. In other words, he’s making most Americans feel more unsettled at a time they normally receive reassurance from the commander in chief. The right is in a constant state of agitation. Trump flails away — ordering transgender Americans out of the military one day, assailing Attorney General Jeff Sessions the next — but the nonstop controversies no longer distract and keep the public off balance. (Was it just last week he declared some military option was on the table — for Venezuela!?) Instead, the aura of failure, panic and unprofessionalism now rests as a permanent cloud over the White House. The events that usually prompt a rally-around-the-president phenomenon don’t perform that function; instead they underscore Trump’s defects. He looks rash and out of his depth on North Korea, the kind of national security semi-crisis in which normal presidents can show off their diplomatic skills and steady temperament. Not Trump. Likewise, in times of violence and national tragedy, Presidents George W. Bush (after 9/11) and Barack Obama (after the shooting of then-Democratic congresswoman Gabby Giffords and after the slaughter at the African American church in South Carolina) could rise to the occasion, transcending partisan divisions to create moments of unity and shared grief. Trump spreads anger and division. [Donald Trump’s despicable words] The U.S. president has two functions — head of government and head of state. Trump has failed miserably at the first. His inability to understand the details of policy and his lack of persuasive skills (bullying and threats don’t work, as we saw in the Trumpcare debate) have left him with only a couple of accomplishments (getting Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, achieving some regulatory rollbacks). But, if it’s possible, he’s performing even more dreadfully as head of state. In that role, empathy, historical perspective, humility and eloquence are all required. Trump has none of these qualities. Rather than look bigger than life, he looks like a peevish child. Trump never thought he’d be president and never was prepared to be. Now we see what happens when he is unable to rise to the occasion. And the country is getting tired of watching him lose it, day after day.

Elizabeth Warren’s advice for Democrats: Don’t fall back to the center,"On Saturday morning, as the nation’s attention turned to the white supremacist march in Charlottesville and its violent aftermath, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) used a speech at the progressive Netroots Nation convention to lay down a marker for the Democratic Party’s future. There was little buzz in the room about the 2020 presidential primaries — shouts of “Run Warren Run” and “Warren 2020″ were short and muted. But Warren, one of the party’s most popular figures, told activists that they could safely ignore any advice about how Democrats could win only through moderation. [Analysis: Centrist Democrats begin pushing back against Bernie Sanders, liberal wing] Here are four points that we’re probably going to hear more about as the left wages and mostly wins battles inside the party. No fear of “identity politics.” Near the top of her remarks, Warren ridiculed — by name — a New York Times op-ed in which pollster Mark Penn and disgraced politician Andrew Stein beseeched Democrats to “move to the center and reject the siren calls of the left.” This, according to Warren, not-so-subtly suggested that the party needed to pander to white voters at the expense of non-whites. “Apparently, the path forward is to go back to locking up non-violent drug offenders and ripping more holes in our economic safety net,” Warren said. Later, she counted off a series of issues where Democrats decisively took the side of black activists. The “system is rigged,” she said… … when the black-white wealth gap triples over the past three decades. When racist voter ID laws and voter suppression tactics sprout like weeds all across the country. When a man too racist to become a judge in the 1980s now runs the Department of Justice. When communities like Flint are living with poisoned water and polluted air. When there’s still no justice for, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile and so many more. Warren’s opposition to Attorney General Jeff Sessions was already famous, especially on the left, but it was striking that she called him a racist — and she did so to applause. Defining the “bad” donors. Warren, who has repeatedly criticized her party’s 2016 presidential campaign messaging, included one pointed line: “We’re not going back to the days when a Democrat who wanted to run for a seat in Washington first had to grovel on Wall Street.” It was impossible to hear that line and not think of how Hillary Clinton’s campaign, especially after the primary against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), never shook off the stigma of “Wall Street money.” But Warren, who represents Martha’s Vineyard and other bastions of big Democratic money, defined the bad sort of donations narrowly. That reframed the kind of argument that broke out after Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) met with “Clinton donors.” It would be impossible to fund Democratic campaigns without most of the people who backed Clinton; it is possible, and likely a good frame for 2018 and 2020, to noisily reject financial industry money. Labor rights as civil rights. Warren suggested that Democrats needed to get behind basically every priority of the labor movement, and make it easier to join a union, a cause that was stymied in 2010 when Democrats lost the supermajority that could have passed the Employee Free Choice (or card check) bill. “We’re going to fight for fully portable benefits for everyone,” said Warren, “and we’re going to fight to make sure that all work — full-time, part-time, gig — carries basic, pro-rata benefits. We’re going to fight to make it easier for workers to come together to form a union so they can take power into their own hands. And we’re going to turn the minimum wage into a living wage. Fight for $15!” Single-payer health care as a 2020 standard. The arguments between Democrats about whether every 2018 candidate should back single-payer health care are happening, in part, because single-payer is becoming a de facto Democratic position in 2020. Every Senate Democrat seen as a potential candidate, from Warren to Harris to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), now backs “Medicare for All.” Even Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who launched the first 2020 bid this month to — let’s be honest — an avalanche of skepticism, has said he’s “for single-payer evolving from the context of the market we have now.” Warren used her speech to reiterate her support for expanding Social Security payments, and to make single-payer the party’s default health-care pitch. “It’s not enough just to defend the Affordable Care Act, we’re going to improve it, starting with bringing down the costs of prescription drugs — and leading the fight for Medicare for all,” she said. The whole speech is below. Before I begin, I would like to say a word about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program – DACA – that was just discussed. The fights that we fight for – they matter. In 2012 — because of persistence of many of you in this room – 800,000 young men and women were protected from deportation. Because of DACA, DREAMers, who are as American as you and me, were promised a chance. The chance to work. The chance to live without the fear of being ripped away from the only home most of them have ever known. The chance to build a future. Now, President Trump will make a decision on DACA. DREAMers’ future hangs in the balance. This Tuesday, August 15, people are mobilizing to protect DREAMers. Let’s not sit back. Let’s stand together to say: President Trump, let DREAMers stay. They are our friends, our family, our future. Give DREAMers the chance to build their dreams. These fights matter. These fights matter, and that’s why it’s good to be back at Netroots Nation! Thank you Mary, thank you Eric, thank you Arshad, and thank you to the entire Netroots Nation team for bringing us together again. And what a treat it is to be here in Atlanta – the hometown of a man who has taught us the importance of necessary trouble, my friend and hero John Lewis. I look out here and see 3000 progressives, people of every race, gender, religion, and color, all committed to building a better future. I look out here and I see Donald Trump’s worst nightmare. Yes, Trump’s worst nightmare, but also a big threat to everyone who kind of likes things the way they work now. A few weeks ago, I saw an op-ed in the New York Times from a so-called Democratic strategist titled, “Back to the Center, Democrats.” It was all about how we have to stop caring about, quote, “identity politics” and stop waging, quote, “class warfare.” Apparently, the path forward is to go back to locking up non-violent drug offenders and ripping more holes in our economic safety net. I even got a shoutout! Apparently, I’m the face of the problem. So is Bernie. But let’s be really clear here – the real power, the real threat, is not me — it’s you, all of you. It’s your energy, your passion, and your commitment to our values that threaten the bland, business-as-usual establishment. We’ve been warned off before. Give up, keep your heads down, be realistic, act like a grown-up, keep doing the same old same old. But here’s what’s interesting: instead of lots of lots of ferocious back-and-forth and piling on, this time, no one cared. Big yawn. Why? Because the Democratic Party isn’t going back to the days of welfare reform and the crime bill. It is NOT going to happen. We’re not going back to the days of being lukewarm on choice. We’re not going back to the days when universal health care was something Democrats talked about on the campaign trail but were too chicken to fight for after they got elected. And we’re not going back to the days when a Democrat who wanted to run for a seat in Washington first had to grovel on Wall Street. Democrats are heading forward. We are looking ahead – and we will not, we shall not, we must not allow anyone to turn back the clock. A lot of you have been coming since the very first YearlyKos in 2006. That feels like a long, long time ago. Way back in 2006 and still when I first started coming in 2010, a big part of what we were trying to do was to “crash the gate” and get the Democratic Party to listen to us. We wanted a party led by people who weren’t afraid to call themselves progressives. We wanted a party that would defend progressive values. We wanted a chance to fight for progressive solutions to our nation’s challenges. We wanted a movement. And now, look around. We got the progressive movement, and we gather here every year to organize, to energize, and to sing karaoke. And now? We are not the gate crashers of today’s Democratic Party. We are not a wing of today’s Democratic Party. We are the heart and soul of today’s Democratic Party. But, boy, we’ve inherited a hell of a challenge, haven’t we? We’re gathering here in Atlanta in a moment of crisis for our country. And I’m not just talking about Donald Trump and his Twitter account. More and more working families today are hanging on by their fingernails in a country with an economy and a government that works only for those at the very top. This crisis didn’t start when Donald Trump walked into the Oval Office. And it won’t just magically disappear the day he walks out of it. Me, I’ve been shouting about this crisis from every rooftop I could find for years – talking about how our middle class was squeezed to the breaking point, how chances to move up in this economy were disappearing, and warning that, if we weren’t careful, the very promise of this nation — the commitment to expand opportunities — would be lost. That’s the fight that got me into politics. That’s the fight that brought me to my very first Netroots all those years ago. How about you? By applause: Who got into the fight because they were passionate about economic justice? Who came to fight for reproductive rights? How about clean air and clean water? How about immigration? Civil rights? Human rights? Anti-war? Campaign finance reform? Net neutrality? Any other bankruptcy nerds in the house? That’s one of the things I love about coming to Netroots. We all came to this fight from different experiences. We all get fired up about different issues. But if we’re going to be the people who lead the Democratic Party back from the wilderness and lead our country out of this dark time, then we can’t waste energy arguing about whose issue matters most or who in our alliance should be voted off the island. We need to see each other’s fights as our own. And I believe we can. In the wake of the last election, I’ve heard people say we need to decide whether we’re the party of the white working class or the party of Black Lives Matter. I say we can care about a dad who’s worried that his kid will have to move away from their factory town to find good work – and we can care about a mom who’s worried that her kid will get shot during a traffic stop. The way I see it, those two parents have something deep down in common — the system is rigged against both of them — and against their kids. Over the last generation, the most powerful people in this country have gotten way more powerful. Corporate profits and CEO pay are near record highs. But workers’ wages haven’t budged, and, one after another, workers’ rights are getting wiped away. Unions are under attack. Millions of people are struggling to piece together two, three, or four jobs just to pay the rent. The balance of power is shifting in other parts of our economy, too. In industry after industry – airlines, banking, health care, agriculture, tech – a handful of corporate giants control more and more and more. The big guys are locking out smaller, newer competitors. They are crushing innovation. Even if you don’t see the gears turning, this massive consolidation means prices go up and quality goes down for everything from air travel to broadband service. Rural America is left behind, dismissed by corporate giants as fly-over country. This concentration of power strikes at the heart of our democracy. Our government is supposed to be the one place where everybody gets the same fair shot, no matter how powerful or powerless they might be. But thanks to the revolving door between Capitol Hill, K Street and Wall Street, powerful people have more and more influence in Congress. Thanks to Citizens United, corporate money slithers through Washington like a snake. Washington works great for the rich and powerful, but for everyone else, not so much. Yes, the system is rigged – and if you don’t feel like anyone in politics is doing anything to un-rig it, well, that’s how a lot of folks who should have been with us last November wound up voting for Donald Trump. For many Americans, it isn’t news that the balance of power in our country has seriously tilted away from them. African Americans. LGBTQ Americans. Immigrants. Muslims. Women. Poor people. No, I have not personally experienced the fear, the oppression, and the pain that many of my fellow Americans endure every day. But I do know this: For a lot of our fellow citizens, the system is rigged now and it has been rigged for a long, long time. Don’t take my word for it. Just look around. • When women aren’t invited to the debate over our own health care and health insurance must cover Viagra but not birth control. • When we’re almost two decades into the 21st century and we still don’t have equal pay for equal work. • When a man running for President of the United States can get caught on tape bragging about sexual assault and Republican party leaders turn a blind eye. Yeah, the system is rigged. Keep going. • When the black-white wealth gap triples over the past three decades. • When racist voter ID laws and voter suppression tactics sprout like weeds all across the country. • When a man too racist to become a judge in the 1980s now runs the Department of Justice • When communities like Flint are living with poisoned water and polluted air. • When there’s still no justice for, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray, Philando Castile and so many more. Yeah, the system is rigged. Keep going. • When you can still be fired from your job because of who you love. • When you can’t use a public restroom or serve in the military because of your gender identity. • When you’re afraid to report a rape because ICE could split up your family. • When you’re treated like a suspect every minute of your life. Yeah, the system is rigged. And if you don’t feel like anyone in politics is doing anything to un-rig it, or it’s too broken to un-rig at all — well, that’s what a lot of folks felt last November, a lot of folks who should have been with us on election day but who stayed home. So spare me the argument about whether we ought to be trying to bring back folks who voted for Donald Trump or trying to turn out folks who just didn’t vote. Because we can’t do either of those things until we can show that things CAN change – and that WE will fight to change them. It’s easy to make the case that Donald Trump and the Republicans aren’t the answer to any of these problems. Heck, they aren’t even trying. Look at the Republican priorities: • Cut health care coverage for 25 million Americans and drive up insurance costs for millions more. • Cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations. • Roll back Wall Street regulations, gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and let the big banks wreck our economy again. • Turn polluters loose and let them spew, dump and destroy whenever and wherever they want. • Zero out the programs that help people keep a roof over their heads. • Double down against Planned Parenthood, against an undocumented immigrant’s right to due process, against a black American’s right to vote in an election. • And this week, play a stupid, reckless game of chicken with a dangerous foreign power and threaten nuclear war. The Republican agenda will make the powerful more powerful – and leave everyone else further behind. The Republican leadership is willing to threaten our health, our economy, and our basic safety. All true, and we should say so clearly. But that’s not the end of our job. We have to show people that, when we get a chance to lead, things WILL start getting better. And that starts with showing some backbone. Not just backbone when we stand up to Donald Trump, but backbone when we put forward an agenda. For so many Americans, every day is a battle against powerful interests. It’s time for us to pick sides and get in the fight. So let’s talk about picking sides: It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of working people, on the side of Moms and Dads who dream of a better life for their kids, on the side of people in every part of this country and people of every race, gender, and religion who just want a level playing field and a chance to build a future. And we know how to show them that their fight is our fight. • Let’s start with jobs. • It’s time to re-think the basic social contract on labor. We’re going to fight for fully portable benefits for everyone. And we’re going to fight to make sure that all work — full-time, part-time, gig — carries basic, pro-rata benefits. • We’re going to fight to make it easier for workers to come together to form a union so they can take power into their own hands. • And we’re going to turn the minimum wage into a living wage. Fight for $15! It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of hard working families who are getting pounded every day. • We’re going to fight for universal pre-K, and to make it easier for every family to get child care. • We’re going to fight like hell to stop Republicans from jacking up the cost of health insurance and taking coverage away from millions. Trumpcare will not get one Democratic vote – not now, not ever. But it’s not enough just to defend the Affordable Care Act, we’re going to improve it, starting with bringing down the costs of prescription drugs – and leading the fight for Medicare for all. • We’re going to make it possible for young people to go to college or get a technical degree debt-free. • We’re going to fight for affordable housing and good schools across our country, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns and most remote rural homesteads. • And we will fight our hearts out to defend — and expand — Social Security and Medicare. It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of consumers. • So we’re going to fight to break up the monopolies that are killing competition. • We’re going to put a cop on the beat so that no one can steal your purse on Main Street or your pension on Wall Street. • And whether you’re shopping for broadband or a student loan, an airline ticket or health insurance, we’re going to go to bat for you to help make damn sure you don’t get cheated. It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of science. • We’re done arguing about whether climate change is real – and we’re going to fight it with everything we have. • We’re done arguing about whether trickle-down economics works – and we’re going to fight to build this economy so it works for working families. • We’re done arguing about gun safety – and we’re going to fight for the common-sense reforms the overwhelming majority of Americans want. It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of fairness and equality. • So we’re going to fight for equal pay for equal work. • We’re going to keep Planned Parenthood open, and we’re going to make sure women have access to safe, legal abortions. • And we’re going to fight to put more women in positions of power, from committee rooms to boardrooms to that really nice Oval-shaped room at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. • And we’re going to reform our criminal justice system so that getting caught with a baggie of pot doesn’t mean your life is ruined, and getting pulled over by the cops doesn’t mean your life is at risk. It’s time for us to say: Democrats are on the side of American values. • So we’re going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform. And we’re going to say to every DREAMer in this country: You are an American. This country is your home. And we have your back. • We’re going to fight to wipe the stain of Donald Trump’s Muslim ban off the books once and for all. And, by the way, Mr. President: We’re never, ever going to build your stupid wall. • We’re also going to fight for our democracy. That means we’ll fight to reverse Citizens United so big corporations can’t BUY our elections, and we’ll fight to stop voter ID laws so Republicans can’t STEAL our elections either. And, by the way: it’s time for us to up front about whose side we’re not on. We’re not on the side of big Wall Street banks that break the law — we think everyone needs to be accountable. When bank CEOs break the law, they ought to go to jail just like everyone else. We’re not on the side of the giant companies that want to twist government rules for themselves. We’re going to slam shut that revolving door, and we say enough is enough with corporate money that is drowning our democracy. We’re not on the side of the bigots and the misogynists – and unlike the so-called Republican “leadership” in Washington, we’re not afraid to say it to their faces. And we’re not on the side of foreign governments that hack our elections or politicians whose fragile egos put our national security at risk. Folks, we don’t have to tip-toe. We don’t have to hedge our bets. We don’t have to ask permission from the pundits or the corporate CEOs – and we sure don’t have to ask permission from Mitch McConnell. [pause] Actually, that’s a good thing because I think he would probably tell me to sit down and shut up. Nevertheless, I would persist. We don’t have to fear the wrath of the powerful, because when we’re bold enough to stand up for our values, when we’re bold enough to stand up for our fellow Americans, that’s when we ARE powerful. Isn’t that the spirit that brought us all to this movement? Isn’t that the reason we’re proud to call ourselves progressives? Isn’t that the Democratic Party we want to call our own? This fight is our fight. This fight is the fight Americans have been waiting for someone to take on. This fight is the fight Americans are ready to rally behind. This fight is the fight Americans are counting on us to win. This fight is my fight. This fight is your fight. So let’s go win it! Thank you! "

Trump is torturing Mitch McConnell for sport. Here’s how McConnell can get revenge.,"THE MORNING PLUM: For many liberals, the spectacle of President Trump publicly tormenting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) over his failure to pass health-care repeal surely carries a whiff of poetic justice or perhaps even schadenfreude. During the election, McConnell pocketed a Supreme Court seat for Trump and helped scuttle bipartisan condemnation of Russian meddling, even though he likely knew Trump was unfit for the presidency and, worse, an untrustworthy ally of the GOP — ideologically, perhaps, but more to the point, temperamentally. Now McConnell is being targeted by the sort of pathological abuse that Trump has directed at other flunkies who have failed him, such as Jeff Sessions and Sean Spicer. But instead of relishing this moment, we should hope and push for another resolution to this saga — one in which McConnell gets his revenge by helping shore up the Affordable Care Act’s individual markets, thus deftly undercutting Trump’s similarly pathological threats to sabotage the law. As crazy as that sounds, there’s actually a good case for it. First, a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll out today finds that large majorities want Republicans to do this. The key findings: Now, the last two of those findings concern what the public wants Trump to do, and he can’t be persuaded to act with that in mind, but McConnell surely knows that if Trump goes through with his threats, it would create a major political problem for congressional Republicans in the looming 2018 elections. Another recent Kaiser poll found that 61 percent say congressional Republicans and Trump are now responsible for any future problems with the ACA, meaning they now own whatever happens with the markets. McConnell himself knows this. In July, McConnell explicitly said that if the GOP repeal push failed, Republicans would have to work with Democrats to shore up the markets, because doing nothing is “not an alternative.” This was a tacit admission that for Republicans, doing nothing is not an option politically. What’s more, other Republicans are now moving forward with bipartisan efforts to shore up the markets, in direct defiance of Trump. Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee has announced that the health committee, which he chairs, will work this fall on legislation to boost the markets. Alexander has also said that Trump must continue funding the CSRs, which Trump continues to threaten to cut off, a move that could leave many millions without coverage options. A pair of House Republicans has joined with Democrats to push an effort that would legislatively fund the CSRs. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), who chairs the House Energy Committee, has also called for them to be legislatively funded, suggesting he, too, knows House Republicans will be held responsible in 2018 for sabotage. Remember, the mere uncertainty Trump is fomenting by not saying whether he’ll continue the CSRs is itself undermining the markets — and if that gets worse, Republicans could bear the blame. If this continues, at some point GOP leaders — including McConnell — will be pressed to support a more formal bipartisan process to stop it. Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at Kaiser, emails: Uncertainty about insurance market rules and underlying fragility in certain markets around the country are driving premiums up significantly and causing insurers to exit. These are problems that can be fixed pretty easily by Congress, for example by appropriating funds for cost-sharing subsidies and providing funding to help pay for the care of high-cost patients. The industry will be closely watching the bipartisan hearings in the Senate in September for a possible way forward. I don’t know what McConnell will do — surely there are pressures that make it hard for him to back efforts to shore up the markets, and who knows if this could pass the House. But so doing would amount to an elegant way to give Trump the middle finger. Trump went all in with McConnell’s repeal push, but now Trump is heaping all the blame for failure on McConnell and again demanding Republicans get repeal done, putting them in an impossible position for sport. As part of this effort to distract his voters from his role in repeal’s collapse, he is threatening further ACA sabotage to prove to them that his toughness remains undiminished. McConnell, by acting to boost the markets, could move to take that weapon out of Trump’s hands, undercutting the chance that Trump’s craziness further damages congressional Republicans in 2018 while simultaneously leaving Trump sputtering ineffectually on the sidelines. And don’t say Trump’s voters would rage at the GOP, because no matter how angrily Trump tweeted about this outcome, they won’t want collapsing insurance markets, either. * WHY THE NORTH KOREA STANDOFF IS SO DANGEROUS: Experts tell the New York Times that even a limited strike by Trump on North Korea probably would not be able to avoid setting off a spiral of widespread destruction and death: Even a limited strike against a North Korean missile on its launching pad or the shooting down of a missile in midair would pose risks that the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, might retaliate, setting off a spiral of escalation that could plunge the Korean Peninsula into war. … A major consideration would be whether and when to evacuate American and other allied civilians, which is no small feat as Seoul, a city of about 10 million, is within range of North Korea’s rockets and artillery … Fortunately, we have a president who has demonstrated a penchant for carefully weighing the unintended consequences of every decision he makes. * IF TRUMP ORDERS NUKE STRIKE, HIS ADVISERS CAN’T DO MUCH: Dan Lamothe has a great piece explaining that if Trump orders a nuclear strike, it cannot be overruled by either military leaders or the Congress: The reason is simple: The system is set up for the United States to launch an attack within minutes, so that if the United States is under a nuclear attack, it can respond almost instantly, said Bruce Blair, a former nuclear watch officer. Trump would presumably meet with [Defense Secretary Jim] Mattis, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. and Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House national security adviser, before launching a preemptive attack, but it would “really be uncharted territory” if they sought to stall or slow down an order from the president, Blair said. A few Democrats are pushing ways to pass legislation to place some constraints on this process, but as Lamothe notes, these efforts are “unlikely to [succeed] with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress.” * REPORT: STATE DEPARTMENT ‘RATTLED’ BY TRUMP COMMENTS: Yesterday Trump thanked Russian President Vladimir Putin for expelling hundreds of U.S. diplomatic staff from Russia, saying, “Now we have a smaller payroll.” Reuters reports: The State Department [is] “horrified and rattled” by Trump’s remarks, said a veteran U.S. diplomat who has served in Russia, speaking on condition of anonymity. And Heather Conley, formerly a top State Department official dealing with European affairs, said … “it is very difficult to see how the president could view these expulsions as a ‘positive’ development in any form.” It’s not that difficult, really. * WORLD STOCKS SLIDE AMID TENSIONS BETWEEN TRUMP AND NORTH KOREA: The Wall Street Journal reports: The Dow closed down 205 points Thursday, in its biggest decline since May 17, after U.S. President Donald Trump rejected criticism that his threats to release “fire and fury” had been too inflammatory. Instead, he said his statement “maybe wasn’t tough enough.” … The selling in the U.S. extended to global markets Friday. As one investment adviser puts it: “This situation is beginning to develop into this generation’s Cuban missile crisis.” * EVEN NEWT GINGRICH IS NOW CRITICIZING TRUMP: Trump continues to blast McConnell for failing to get repeal through. This is now drawing fire from Trump loyalist Newt Gingrich: “It’s a team problem; the president has to own a piece of this. … I may not be clever enough to understand this, but I don’t see how a Republican president deepening his fight with the Republican majority leader gets him very far.” But, Newt, the thing is, Trump will never “own a piece” of any failure, because he never takes responsibility for anything, ever. By the way, the deadline to raise the debt ceiling looms… * JEFF FLAKE GETS A CHALLENGER: A local news outlet in Arizona is reporting that Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is gearing up to challenge GOP Sen. Jeff Flake in 2018: Sinema has locked down her swing district and proved to be a prolific fund-raiser, with $3.2 million in cash on hand as of June 30, a solid base for a Senate run in Arizona. … Recent polling shows Flake with high disapproval ratings among Arizona voters, driven down in part by his recent votes for the Obamacare repeal. This might explain why Flake has been escalating his criticism of Trump of late. But he’s on record voting for the repeal bill that failed in the Senate — i.e., for an effort to move Trumpcare forward. * DON’T GET COMPLACENT ABOUT THE TRUMP ERA: Paul Krugman looks at all the forces that are collaborating to push climate denialism — fossil-fuel interests; ideological foes of regulating business; bought-and-paid-for analysts — and concludes: Right now progressives are feeling better than they expected to a few months ago: Donald Trump and his frenemies in Congress are accomplishing a lot less than they hoped, and their opponents feared. But that doesn’t change the reality that the axis of climate evil is now firmly in control of U.S. policy, and the world may never recover. Of course, there is some hope in the fact that Trump will have a very hard time fully undoing climate regulations, even as some states will continue forging ahead, but yeah. * AND TRUMP KEEPS UP THE TWITTER BRINKMANSHIP: Good morning, Mr. President: Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2017  Again, one wonders whether Trump’s top national security officials had any idea that this carefully crafted statement, in the midst of an extremely volatile crisis, was coming.

Trump couldn’t have picked a dumber fight,"“Attacking Mitch McConnell is the most gobsmackingly stupid thing the president has done yet. And that’s saying quite a bit.” That’s how Michael Steel, former spokesman for ex-House speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), described President Trump’s attack on the Senate majority leader. Trump on Wednesday had taunted McConnell on Twitter for not delivering the votes for Trumpcare. (“Why not done?”) McConnell, it seems, had set the president off with remark delivered Monday to a Rotary Club in Kentucky. “Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before and, I think, had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,” McConnell observed. Well, no one ever accused Trump of stopping while he was behind. His “gobsmackingly stupid” indictment of the majority leader continued Thursday morning. He tweeted, “Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn’t get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!” Let’s count the ways in which this is unhelpful to the president. [Why the GOP might kill the filibuster after all] First, Congress is already ignoring him; Republicans have made clear they are moving on from health care and his peevish rant won’t change their minds. When they continue to ignore his heckling, it will be Trump who, once again, looks impotent. Second, in a week in which much of the country is disturbed that the president lacks the gravitas, discipline and judgment to be commander in chief, Trump’s attack reinforces the idea that he is motivated by personal pique and is incapable of dispassionate strategizing. Third, McConnell has resisted naming a select committee to investigate the Russia scandal. He and his Senate Republicans have been utterly uninterested in examining Trump’s conflicts of interest and potential violations of the emoluments clause. McConnell could decide at any moment to pursue those lines of inquiry. Fourth, to the extent Trump makes Senate Republicans the enemy, he helps Democrats who, until now, were thought to have only a remote chance of winning the Senate majority. Losses by Sens. Jeff Flake of Arizona and Dean Heller of Nevada in 2018 would leave the Senate split 50-50, with Vice President Pence essential to break ties. A single retirement or defection (anyone certain Lisa Murkowski of Alaska or Susan Collins of Maine would never, ever flip parties?) would give Democrats the majority. And with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) potentially absent due to his medical treatment, Democrats could have the upper hand even without a midterm retirement or defection. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee should send Trump flowers and chocolates to show their gratitude. [From ‘I need loyalty’ to ‘Witch Hunt’: Trump’s second 100 days, in his words and ours] And finally, if the House ever impeaches Trump, the Senate tries the president. Does Trump really want to convince the “jury” that it would be better off without him? In sum, in Trump’s mind, the categorization of someone as friend or foe depends almost entirely on whether they support and lavishly praise him. He cannot comprehend that legal or ethical rules (as Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed in recusing himself from the Russia affair), allegiance to democratic institutions, or personal principle (!) might have a greater hold on others. In Trump’s mind, there are no excuses for defying or criticizing him. Now, it would be one thing if Trump’s poll numbers were high and he was helping to enact a GOP agenda. He is doing neither. This latest tantrum should serve to remind Republicans: They’d be better off without him.

Donald Trump is already costing conservative lawmakers seats — in the U.K.,"Despite winning the presidency, Donald Trump is a historically unpopular political figure. He had the lowest favorability ratings of any modern presidential nominee during the 2016 campaign, and he is  less popular than any  president in the history of modern polling has been at this point in his term. As unpopular as President Trump is in the United States, he is even more disliked in Western Europe. The graph below from Pew’s Global Attitude Project shows that confidence in Trump to do the right thing in world affairs ranges from 7 percent in Spain to  22 percent in the United Kingdom. That represents a huge decrease from Pew polls conducted while Barack Obama was in office.  A sizable majority in the U.K. were not happy that  Trump was elected president, either. Right after he won the presidency, 65 percent of respondents in a November-December 2016 British Election Study survey said they were disappointed by Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton, while only 15 percent were happy about it. It’s no surprise, then, that the Labour Party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, regularly contrasted his opposition to Trump with the Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May’s “subservient” relationship with Trump. Pro-Labour videos even featured May and Trump holding hands during her January 2017 visit to the White House. Corbyn’s attacks on May’s relationship with the president intensified in the final week of the campaign after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord and attacked the Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his response to the June 3 London Bridge terrorist attack.  Both of Trump’s actions were broadly condemned across the U.K. in the days leading up to the election. So, could Trump have really affected the U.K. election? Several commentators have suggested that May’s embrace of Trump contributed to her party’s unexpectedly poor performance on election day. Although Conservatives expanded their vote share from 37 percent in 2015 to 42 percent in 2017, Labour’s vote share rose at an even greater rate (from 30 percent to 40 percent).  The upshot was that Conservatives lost 13 seats in the House of Commons and their parliamentary majority. Now we have even more direct evidence of a “Trump effect” in election. The British Election Study (BES) has collected some remarkable data: Their ongoing 2014-2018 Internet Panel interviewed the exact same 7,616 individuals eight different times between May 2015 and June 2017 — including after the U.K. General Election in May 2015, after the U.S. election in November 2016, and after the U.K. General Election in June 2017. Thus, we can determine whether reactions to Trump’s election affected the Conservative Party’s changing electoral fortunes from 2015 to 2017. The results indicate that there was indeed a Trump effect on the U.K. Election. Here is the relationship between voters’ reactions to Trump’s victory and their support for the Conservative and Labour parties in both 2015 and 2017. The left-hand panel shows that Conservatives expanded their vote share from 2015 to 2017 among the minority of voters who were happy Trump won. That growth came largely at the expense of the U.K. Independence Party, thanks to its post-Brexit collapse. But perhaps more importantly, the graph shows that May’s party lost votes among the majority of voters who were disappointed by Trump’s victory. The right-hand panel shows the exact opposite pattern for the Labour Party. Labour’s vote share increased by about 10 percentage points among voters who were disappointed that Trump won, compared to just a five-point increase among Trump supporters. With nearly two-thirds of voters in the U.K. disappointed by Trump’s victory, Labour’s superior performance among this majority helped the party in 2017.  Meanwhile, Conservatives’ inability to expand on their 2015 margins among voters opposed to Trump appeared to hurt them. Of course, this doesn’t mean Trump was the only, or even the most important, reason for the Conservatives’ poor performance. But even after controlling for Brexit support, attitudes about immigration, left-right ideological placement, age and gender, reactions to Trump’s election were still associated with vote change from 2015 to 2017.  With all of those factors accounted for, voters who were very happy about Trump’s election were about 15 percentage points more likely to switch to the Conservatives than voters who were very disappointed. There has been a similar Trump effect on public opinion in the United States as well. Americans with unfavorable opinions of Trump are now more opposed to his signature border wall and more supportive of Barack Obama and Muslims than they were before the 2016 presidential campaign. In fact, some of Trump’s biggest campaign foils — immigrants, Muslims and Obamacare — are all approaching record popularity. At home, this Trump effect makes it more difficult for the president to pass his legislative agenda. Not only does the spillover of unpopularity from Trump into his policy proposals decrease support for them (see: Trumpcare), but Republican members of Congress must also worry about hitching their wagon to the party’s historically unpopular president. The Trump effect in the U.K. election shows that foreign leaders might also need to worry. As public opinion turns sharply against the president in most countries, more leaders may find it advantageous to distance themselves from Trump.

"Congress dances on the (debt) ceiling, and it’s not pretty","Well, well, well. The Post reported Tuesday that “debt-ceiling talks between White House, Senate break up with no progress.”  According to my colleagues, the meeting attended by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) “ended without any progress — or even a clear sense of what the lawmakers need to deliver votes to raise the limit.” I’ve been warning y’all about this since March. Congress isn’t the only entity conflicted about what to do. So is the White House. While Mnuchin has been the grown-up in the Trump administration calling consistently and clearly for a clean (no conditions) raising of the debt ceiling, a certain someone of significance has been muttering something completely different. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney has made it clear that raising the debt ceiling with conditions is a-okay by him. Heck, he even said chasing the rainbow that is Obamacare repeal should be tackled first. No wonder my colleague Catherine Rampell correctly dubbed Mulvaney “the most dangerous man in Washington.” [The most dangerous man in Washington] The policy discordance within the Trump administration should freak you out. Both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Bipartisan Policy Center (BPC) warn that if the legal limit on federal borrowing is not lifted sometime in early to mid-October, Uncle Sam might not have enough money on hand to pay all of its bills when they are due. The full faith and credit of the United States hangs in the balance. [Look past the smoke from the Trump White House funeral pyre, and you’ll see financial Armageddon.] And don’t think for a minute that the fallout from not raising the debt ceiling will not impact Americans from sea to shining sea. As we get closer to financial doomsday, the BPC undoubtedly will do what it did when we went through this avoidable nonsense back in 2011 and 2015. It put out these handy and terrifying charts that show the daily impact of U.S. default for every day the borrowing limit is not increased. Anyone who gets any kind of check from the federal government (think veterans, retirees) could get an IOU instead. Interest rates on mortgages and other loans could spike. Nations could turn away from the dollar as the reserve currency of the world. The United States would be like that bunny trying to outrun that avalanche in Russia we’ve seen on the Web. Perhaps not as successfully. After Congress comes back from summer recess next month, there will be just 12 working days until the end of the fiscal year, which is also around the time the treasury will have insufficient funds to pay its bills. The debt ceiling is one of a host of things on the congressional agenda. It also includes the herculean effort to reform the tax code, which is going to gum up the effort to avoid default because Republicans haven’t seen fit to work with Democrats. “Asking Democrats to provide the votes to lift the debt ceiling while you blow a multitrillion-dollar hole in the deficit with a partisan tax package is not in furtherance of avoiding a default,” Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), told me. “Jamming Democrats on big issues without any outreach whatsoever is going to make a very difficult September needlessly more difficult.” [The OMG moment at a congressional budget hearing you should care about but don’t — yet] Are you freaked out yet? I was — until Shai Akabas, director of fiscal policy at BPC, told me not to freak out just yet. “We’ve seen this show before. The unfortunate pattern is that negotiations usually don’t get serious until much closer to the projected X Date,” Akabas said, referring to the estimated date when the treasury will be unable to pay its bills on time and in full. “Based on recent history, I would have been more surprised if they had emerged with the outline of a deal at this stage.” Unfortunately, that’s cold comfort. We’re talking about a Republican-controlled Congress and an Oval Office that has shown an inability to get even its own cherished task done.

Trump is clueless about health care. Republicans are worse.,"It's hard not to laugh about the fact that President Trump thought it was going to be “so easy” to give people “great health care at a tiny fraction of the price.” But as clueless as he was to believe that health insurance only costs $1 a month for 21-year-olds, it's not like the rest of the Republican Party was much better. They never moved beyond merely having a plan to have a plan to replace Obamacare. They just weren't as memorably vague about it as Trump was when he promised to come up with “something terrific.” Now, for seven years, Republicans have attacked Obamacare with the same solemnity and frequency that they typically reserve for praising Ronald Reagan. They held symbolic votes against it. Then they held some more. They challenged it in court. Then they did it again over a typo. They shut the government down over it. And, now that he's in office, Trump has even threatened to withhold some of the law's subsidies in a not-so-veiled attempt to make the whole thing “implode.” Throughout it all, though, Republicans haven't been able to agree on what they want to do, only what they don't. Which, of course, is anything like Obamacare's alleged “big government takeover” of health care. The only problem with that is that Obamacare is not, in fact, a big government takeover. The opposite, actually. It's just about the most market-friendly way to cover poor and sick people. Indeed, the conservative Heritage Foundation supported something a lot like it back in 1989. As did former Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1993. And former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2006. So by vilifying their old plan as unconstitutional socialism, Republicans haven't left themselves a lot of leeway to come up with a new one. Well, other than just going back to the way things were before Obamacare. That's what most Republicans really want. They think insurance companies should be able to once again discriminate against people with preexisting conditions and sell plans that are only useful as long as you don't need to use them. Or, as they call it, allowing state-based innovation and a free market in health care! Not to mention that they don't think the government should be expanding Medicaid or otherwise giving people money to help buy insurance. The only thing they would change about the pre-Obamacare status quo would be having more people in the kind of high-deductible plans that would force them to pay even more of their costs out-of-pocket, the idea being that this would turn price-insensitive patients into bargain-hunting consumers of health care — an idea, coincidentally, that researchers Zarek Brot-Goldberg, Amitabh Chandra, Benjamin Handel and Jonathan Kolstad found hasn't held up when it's actually been put into practice. Republicans, in other words, have tied themselves in a Gordian knot. The only thing less popular than letting insurance companies charge sick people more is making people pay more out-of-pocket — especially when you've criticized Obamacare's “soaring deductibles” and promised to lower them, like Trump has. So Republicans have defended their plan the best way they can: by trying to prevent people from finding out about it. According to Vox's Sarah Kliff, Republicans have held a combined two hearings in the House and Senate about repealing Obamacare compared to the 44 Democrats did about Obamacare itself back in 2009. It's no surprise that they didn't wait to get the final budget scores for their bills, either. After all, how many times can you listen to experts tell you that your plan would lead to 22 million fewer people having health insurance? But maybe the Republicans' best trick was convincing themselves that their plan wasn't really their plan. House Republicans, you see, passed a bill that Trump himself said was “mean” under the assumption that the Senate would make it better. At which point Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill they scribbled down at lunch that Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called a “fraud” and a “disaster,” under the assumption that the conference committee would make it better. Which is to say that Republicans could only talk themselves into voting for their plans as long as they could talk themselves into believing that they still had a secret one up their sleeves. Republicans, then, haven't been able to come up with a conservative alternative to Obamacare, because Obamacare is the conservative alternative. And they won't be able to unless they're willing to make the case that the government shouldn't help the poor and sick get covered — or just lie about their plan. In the meantime, though, you can bet that they think they're getting closer and closer. Republican health-care policy is like tomorrow. It's always a day away. "
The Health 202: Trump turns glare to health care subsidies,"THE PROGNOSIS President Trump waves after dining at Trump International Hotel on Saturday. (EPA/CHRIS KLEPONIS / POOL) Even if they weren't able to snuff out Obamacare, Republicans appear determined to ensure its marketplaces accelerate their meltdown. Over the weekend, President Trump castigated the Senate for failing to pass multiple versions of legislation repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act, despite a marathon health-care debate that spanned four days last week. The president has few options left at this point, but he does have power over one crucial part of the ACA marketplaces: payments covering cost-sharing discounts (or CSRs) that insurers must offer to the lowest-income customers. These payments are estimated to total $7 billion this year -- making up about 15 percent of all federal subsidies on which marketplace plans are counting. At this moment, it's up to the administration whether to make the monthly CSR payments to insurers. So far, it has delivered them around the 20th of each month. But the president tweeted on Saturday that he's considering withholding the next batch (presumably in August), if Republicans don't find a way to move past their seemingly insurmountable gridlock on health care: If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon! And this morning: If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays? White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said yesterday that Trump will decide this week about whether to continue the payments: White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. (Photo by Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) “He’s going to make that decision this week, and that’s a decision that only he can make,” Conway said on “Fox News Sunday.” The authority to pay these subsidies could soon shift from the administration to Congress. A federal district court ruled last year that Congress must use its power of the purse if the payments are to be made. If the Trump administration doesn't continue an appeal of the ruling, which was begun by the Obama administration, Congress would take the reins. But it's not so clear congressional Republicans would agree to pay insurers, at this point. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared to threaten as much in the wee hours Friday morning in a post-mortem after his skinny repeal"" bill failed by one vote. He called on Democrats to share their own ideas for health-care changes -- adding that without a real revamp"
Who saved Obamacare from the GOP? The American people.,"Constituent power is a wondrous thing in a representative democracy. After the election in November, political prognosticators speculated that President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, was probably as good as dead. Some thought President Trump might even sign a “Trumpcare” bill on his first day. But on Friday, more than six months into Trump’s presidency, Senate Republicans announced that their attempt to repeal Obamacare had collapsed. The defeat was months in the making. In December, we released a Google Doc titled “Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda.” As former congressional staffers, we witnessed the rise of the tea party and saw the power of local, defensive congressional advocacy. After Trump’s election, we recommended that progressives implement the same strategies and tactics — minus the racism and violence. To our surprise, the Google Doc went viral, and today there are locally led Indivisible groups in every single congressional district in the country, full of members applying their constituent power. Trumpcare was the victim of constituent power, which is based on a simple principle of American democracy: Members of Congress need their constituents to get reelected, which requires at least appearing to represent the constituent interests. When a sufficiently large group of constituents repeatedly demonstrate local opposition to a piece of legislation, it’s awfully tough for members of Congress from those precincts to support it. That’s constituent power in action. [Why a decentralized swarm of resistance is the best way to resist Trump] Make no mistake: The leaders of our new, unified, conservative federal government were desperate to enact Trumpcare. But the combined political might of the president of the United States, the speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader was no match for one simple thing: people showing up. And show up they did, because constituent power is locally applied power. From town halls to “die-ins” to sit-ins to mailing protest potatoes, constituents took action not in Washington but in their home states. Since before Trump was even inaugurated, and in the months following, these local leaders relentlessly opposed Trumpcare at every local congressional office, town hall and rally at home. While this local pressure may have surprised some, its power couldn’t have surprised Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). McConnell, who has worked in politics since the Johnson administration, is an arch conservative and a brilliant legislator. Tasked with getting Trumpcare through the Senate, he allowed no public hearings and repeatedly attempted to move the legislation forward without divulging its details, even to his fellow Republican senators. Remarked one Senate Republican this month: “It’s an insane process.” But there was method in the madness. McConnell knew that a traditionally methodical and open Senate process would allow public pressure to build and that the only strategy with a chance of success was secrecy and speed — to try to hide from and outpace the people. And yet, all his secretive machinations were not enough. There were many twists and turns on the road to his defeat. Two weeks ago, a sufficient number of Republican senators announced their opposition to Trumpcare to kill the bill. While the bill was temporarily dead, McConnell announced that he’d move forward on a new vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. But Republican senators came out against that effort within hours. In response, McConnell committed to voting on yet another Trumpcare iteration. Last week’s defeat of that effort marks yet another “death” of this zombie bill. Why the false starts and failures? Across the country, local advocates have fought against Trumpcare using the only tool they have: constituent power. In Maine, Indivisible groups coordinated statewide visits to each of Sen. Susan Collins’s seven regional offices. In Alaska, they traveled to far-flung rural offices of Sen. Lisa Murkowski to share their health-care stories. In Arizona, crowds of Indivisibles gathered under the blistering sun with umbrellas outside Sen. John McCain’s offices chanting, “Keep us covered!” And when it looked as though Trumpcare was on its last legs last week, Indivisible groups in nearly every state held more than 170 events on a single day at their local congressional offices to make clear that the opposition to Trumpcare is here to stay. [What is power — and how do you get it?] One of the striking things about the past several months was the breadth and depth of coordinated action across the progressive ecosystem. Indivisible groups cheered on or linked arms with activists from National ADAPT, Planned Parenthood, MoveOn, Ultraviolet, Center for Popular Democracy and Credo Mobile, among others. The common feature of these organizations’ work over the past several months was simple: constituent power, relentlessly applied. This pressure made the bill and McConnell’s political calculus unworkable, leaving senators across the ideological spectrum to sink the bill together. Thus, zombie Trumpcare is dead, again. We don’t know whether McConnell will attempt to resurrect it or move on to other Republican priorities. We do know that Republicans have been promising to repeal the ACA for more than seven years, and it isn’t gone yet. And that leaves us with a couple of more lessons from the early Trump era: We know that when constituents across the country rise up and apply their power, they change what is politically possible nationwide. Our task now is to build and sustain that leadership and power because we also know that if we stand together, indivisible, we will win. "
Kelly takes over for Priebus,"The Post reports: President Trump on Friday ousted his White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and named his homeland security secretary, retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, to replace him in a major shake-up for a West Wing beset by chaos and infighting.  . . . Priebus became consumed by internal battles, clashing not only with [Anthony] Scaramucci but finding himself under siege by Trump advisers inside and outside of the White House who complained that he was ineffectual and more concerned with his own public image than the president’s. Given that Priebus was the weakest chief of staff since Bill Clinton’s friend from kindergarten Mack McLarty, that the White House was a den of infighting and backbiting, that Trump’s agenda had stalled, that the president on a daily basis disrupted his own message and the executive branch more generally, the shift from mousy Priebus to no-nonsense general may give Americans hope that the chaos will subside. I wouldn’t be sure there are grounds for optimism. One wonders what understandings were hammered out before Kelly took the job. Did he get full control of all White House staff? Did he have reassurance that the president would not try to fire the special prosecutor without giving Kelly the chance to weigh in? We don’t know, but Kelly, along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, has the gravitas and leverage to threaten to resign if Trump really goes off the rails. Because Kelly reportedly has a good relationship with Stephen K. Bannon and the Trump children, perhaps he can clamp down on the internal staff wars. A number of questions remain. The overarching problem — discussed publicly by conservative activists and pundits and in hallway conversations between GOP lawmakers — is the degree to which the president has lost his emotional stability (or what remained of it) and become entirely divorced from reality. We’ve seen the president in essence meltdown repeatedly over the past couple of weeks (e.g., impulsively tweeting a ban on transgender military personnel, ranting endlessly about his attorney general). To be blunt, Kelly’s hardest task is to steady the president and prevent his emotional and political self-destruction. It’s not clear anyone can do this. Finally, Kelly’s departure opens up the secretary of homeland security spot. The Senate has an obligation to carefully vet Kelly’s successor, determine his intentions with regard to the partially halted Muslim ban (and the supposed review of vetting procedures that were the rationale for the ban), his position on “dreamers” and more. It’s long past the point at which the GOP should cease rubberstamping nominees. In sum, Kelly brings personal discipline to the White House, but it is far from clear he can impose discipline on Trump. This has been the worst week of the Trump presidency (with Trumpcare’s failure, the tantrums about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the transgender ban). At least under Kelly the opportunity for vast improvement — even just some semblance of normalcy — is possible. Kelly’s selection is a vivid admission that this presidency is failing. We will have to see whether the damage is reversible.

Republicans’ Obamacare repeal was never really that popular,"The immediate cause of Republicans’ failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act early Friday morning was the opposition of three Republican senators. But the persistent unpopularity of Republican repeal efforts has weighed heavily on GOP plans, suggesting that Americans’ skepticism has jelled over months of debate. On average, 55 percent of Americans opposed the GOP proposals to replace Obamacare while 22 percent supported them, according to an average of health-care polls tracked by PollingReport, which we compiled starting in March.  Negative reactions to Republican repeal efforts have been strikingly consistent. Polls have asked about GOP proposals using a wide range of wordings, but every single poll tracked by the PollingReport found opposition outweighing support by more than 20 percentage points. Web-based polls not tracked by PollingReport found narrower margins, though support has consistently trailed opposition. Beyond overall support, repeal proposals had only tepid majority support among Republicans, according to polls tracked by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Polls conducted this month find Republican support ranging from 49 to 60 percent. The same polls showed clear opposition from independents (18 to 30 percent) and overwhelming opposition among Democrats (5 to 9 percent). The GOP efforts have not gotten more or less popular over time. Polls from March through May found opposition outpacing support by an average of 32 percentage points, overlapping the House’s passage of a repeal bill. The margin was negative 35 points in June, and negative 31 points in July as the Senate debated varying proposals. Trump supporters represent an exception to that. In May, Kaiser found that 69 percent of Americans who approved of Trump’s job performance had a favorable view of Republican plans to repeal the ACA, but that fell to 54 percent in July. The drop was even more pronounced in Fox News’ polling tracking Trump voters, from 79 percent in May to 52 percent in July. Was the “skinny repeal” more popular? No polls tested Republicans’ “skinny repeal” legislation, which was drawn up Thursday and voted down early Friday morning, and past polling suggests it might have been more popular than previous plans. For one, it focused on repealing the individual mandate to purchase insurance — the part of the ACA that over 6 in 10 people disliked in a November Kaiser survey. It also skirted major federal cuts to future Medicaid spending included in previous bills that were widely unpopular. At the same time, the Senate’s scaled-back repeal had several unpopular components, such as suspending the employer mandate, temporarily blocking funding for Planned Parenthood and allowing states flexibility in deciding which health benefits insurers should be required to cover. Congressional Budget Office forecasts found that the law would result in more people lacking insurance and lead to higher premiums for people purchasing insurance, which also may have sapped public support. As Republicans hammered out new legislation, support for the Affordable Care Act grew. Some 50 percent rated it favorably in the last Kaiser Family Foundation poll earlier this month, up from 43 percent last December and a far cry from its low of 33 percent favorable in November 2013.  Americans still support changes to the Affordable Care Act Whatever their skepticism for Republican repeal efforts, polls show many are not happy with the status quo. A Gallup poll from earlier this month found that 44 percent of Americans want to keep the Affordable Care Act but “make significant changes,” nearly twice as many who want to keep the law “as is” and higher than the 30 percent who wanted to repeal it. And the public is lopsided in favoring a bipartisan approach to changes, a route pushed in a speech earlier this week by Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), one of the three Republicans who voted down the skinny-repeal bill. A 77 percent majority of Americans in a CNN poll this month said Republicans should work with Democrats to pass a health-care bill, while 12 percent preferred continuing attempts to pass a bill that has only Republican support. The strategy — which in practice would require compromises from Democrats as well — was also favored by 69 percent of Republicans. "
This is what you get when you elect Republicans,"This has been quite a week in Washington, a week full of terror, intrigue, suspense, backstabbing and outright chaos. While we might not have been able to predict the particular contours of the catastrophe that complete GOP rule has been, we should have known it would turn out something like this. Guess what, America: This is what you get when you elect Republicans. It goes much further than their repugnant and disastrous effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but all the contemporary GOP’s pathologies could be seen there: their outright malice toward ordinary people, their indifference to the suffering of their fellow citizens, their blazing incompetence, their contempt for democratic norms, their shameless hypocrisy, their gleeful ignorance about policy, their utter dishonesty and bad faith, their pure cynicism, and their complete inability to perform anything that resembles governing. It was the perfect Republican spectacle. It’s remarkable to consider that there was a time not too long ago when the Grand Old Party was known for being serious, sober, a little boring, but above all, responsible. They were conservative in the traditional sense: wanting to conserve what they thought was good and fearful of rapid change. You might not have agreed with them, but there were limits to the damage they could do. The devolution from that Republican Party to the one we see today took a couple of decades and had many sources, but its fullest expression was reached with the lifting up of Donald J. Trump to the presidency, this contemptible buffoon who may have been literally the single worst prominent American they could have chosen to be their standard-bearer. I mean that seriously. Can you think of a single person who might have run for president who is more ignorant, more impulsive, more vindictive and more generally dangerous than Donald Trump? And yet they rallied around him with near-unanimity, a worried shake of the head to his endless stream of atrocious statements and actions the strongest dissent most of them could muster. So now we see the results of putting this party and this president in charge. Let’s take a little tour around the news and see what’s going on, shall we? I could go on and delve into the president’s plan to blow up the Iran nuclear deal, or the climate-denial initiative at the Environmental Protection Agency, or all the fossil-fuel lobbyists now staffing the Interior Department, or any of a hundred abominable policies and programs. But the point is, we’re getting just what we should have expected. Donald Trump isn’t an aberration, he’s the apotheosis of contemporary Republicanism. Republicans don’t care about making an honest case for their priorities; Trump lies nearly every time he opens his mouth. They’re unconcerned about the details of policy; he knows less about how government works than your average sixth-grader. They’re indifferent to human suffering; he literally advocates destroying the individual health-care market so he can blame Barack Obama for the lives that wind up ruined. They advocate a mindless anti-government philosophy; he has so much contempt for governing that he puts his son-in-law in charge of everything from solving the opioid crisis to achieving Middle East peace. They whine endlessly about the liberal media; he spends hours every day watching “Fox & Friends” and takes advice from Sean Hannity. Trump is the essence of the GOP, distilled down to its depraved and odious core. America was given a reprieve last night, saved from the Republicans’ cruelest plans by a Democratic Party that stood strong, thousands of activists and ordinary citizens who organized in opposition and the GOP’s own incompetence. But this what you get when you give today’s Republican Party complete control of the government. Have no doubt: There are more horrors to come.

"Now that Trumpcare has failed, it’s time to drop all the lies","THE MORNING PLUM: It’s fitting that President Trump reacted to the epic collapse of the GOP repeal-and-replace push by vowing to keep up his campaign to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. “Let Obamacare implode, then deal,” Trump tweeted, meaning the administration should continue undermining the law, to force Democrats to the table to … well, it’s not clear what he wants from them, but it is clear is that he will continue sabotaging the ACA out of sheer rage and spite. For Trump, this has never been about improving our health-care system. Trump, who visibly had no idea how the ACA works or what was in the various GOP replacements, and who openly said he would sign whatever Republicans put in front of him, just wanted to boast of a “win” while triumphantly using Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement as his own personal toilet paper roll. Trump has not yet secured that opportunity for himself. The “skinny repeal” bill failed, after Sen. John McCain cast the dramatic vote against it that, along with the opposition of Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, sealed its fate, and for now, the fate of the GOP repeal push. Trump raged that all Democrats and three Republicans had “let the American people down.” But this outcome, ironically, was good news not just for the American people overall, but also for untold numbers of Trump’s own voters, the low-income and aging whites who also benefited from the ACA’s historic coverage expansion. Trump’s voters were spared the destructive impact of his peculiar combination of ignorance, megalomania and sheer indifference to the fate of millions. Trump’s threat to keep sabotaging the ACA, however, could actually still end up hurting a lot of people. There are plenty of tools that the administration can employ to keep sabotaging the individual markets and the ACA. Politico has a good rundown:  The administration can do too little to promote enrollment or scale back enforcement of the mandate or give states more leeway to experiment with Medicaid in destructive ways. The administration can continue to refuse to guarantee cost-sharing reductions, which has already caused insurers to exit the markets and hike premiums, something that could continue or get worse, leaving many more people without coverage options. Insurers are already warning of such an outcome. I don’t know if Trump will make good on these threats. But the important point is that the openly stated goal here is to hurt our health-care system — which would hurt real people — in service of an end that Trump has not articulated. Democrats cannot support GOP plans that would leave millions uncovered, and yet, because Trump has no interest in understanding what challenges the ACA and our health system face, he has no idea what any “deal” with Democrats would look like. His only discernible strategy is to use the threat to harm millions to force Democrats to capitulate to him in some manner that will remain undefined. But there is another way. If there is one thing I hope happens now, it’s that Trump and Republicans can shape their current response to the ACA around an acceptance of an idea that many of them have refused to acknowledge: that the ACA has effected positive change in the lives of millions, making American life more humane and just. The Medicaid expansion has expanded coverage to millions of poor people, many of whom no doubt never had coverage in their lives, and many deep in the heart of Trump country. The exchanges, for all their problems, have helped extend coverage to millions more, particularly people with preexisting conditions, who can now get robust insurance packages, and lower-income people who can now get coverage with the help of subsidies. Trump’s ongoing threats to sabotage the ACA have important overlap with the position of many congressional Republicans. Unlike Trump, Republicans had genuine principled reasons for wanting the ACA repealed — many of them sincerely believe that the ACA’s expansion of government spending and regulation is not worth the benefits the law has brought. But beyond this, many Republicans have also refused for years to tell the truth about the real-world impact of the law, or about what their own replacements for it would actually do. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan kept lying right up until the end, claiming the ACA is merely “collapsing and hurting American families.” Throughout, Republicans claimed endlessly that their solutions would not cut Medicaid and would leave nobody worse off, and that if millions were left uninsured, it would be by choice under the new reign of freedom they would usher in. Trump, too, hopes to sabotage the ACA under the guise of the lie that it is collapsing of its own accord. But the American people flatly rejected all of these arguments. By finally introducing concrete plans of their own that would bring about an enormous rollback of the ACA’s historic coverage gains, Trump and Republicans managed to get Americans to take another look at Obamacare. The result is that it finally edged into positive approval territory, with large majorities supporting the basic priorities embedded in its expansion of health spending on poor and working people, paid for by high-end taxes, and large majorities rejecting the GOP’s massively regressive alternative. My point is not that Republicans should stop making arguments against the ACA or stop trying to move our health-care system in a conservative direction. Indeed, a genuinely bipartisan approach to reforming our health-care system could end up giving Republicans some deregulatory measures in exchange for GOP help in shoring up the exchanges and a GOP acceptance of the ACA’s coverage expansion. Some Republican health wonks are now calling on their party to adopt a similar approach. But for this to happen, we would all have to proceed from shared agreement that this coverage expansion — one fostered by government — has actually helped enormous numbers of people, even if it isn’t in the manner that Republicans had hoped. * REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR BILL KNEW IT COULD BE DISASTROUS: An important point in the New York Times overview: Even some senators who voted for the bill Friday conceded that its enactment could have been disastrous. It would have repealed the mandate that most Americans have insurance, without another mechanism to push Americans to maintain insurance coverage. Under those circumstances, healthy people could wait to buy insurance until they are sick. The insurance markets would become dominated by the chronically ill, and premiums would soar, insurers warned. Let’s not forget that most Senate Republicans, in an act of staggering bad faith, voted for something they knew (if the House passed it, which Ryan suggested could happen) could end up becoming law, despite knowing it would be massively damaging to the country. * MIKE PENCE’S LAST-MINUTE PLEAS FAIL: The Post has a great anecdote showing how the vice president’s last-minute plea to John McCain, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski failed: Pence walked over at 12:44 a.m. McCain smiled, pointed at Collins and Murkowski, said something about “marching orders,” and stood up. “Mr. Vice President,” he said, greeting Pence. For the next 21 minutes, the vice president cajoled McCain, Collins and Murkowski. Twice during the conversation, a Pence aide came to whisper in the vice president’s ear — other reporters learned it was the White House calling. The ignominious performance of Vice President Pence, who lied about the GOP bill in truly reprehensible fashion, should also not be forgotten. * WHERE MUELLER’S PROBE MAY BE HEADED: USA Today scoops: Since Election Day, President Trump’s businesses have sold at least 30 luxury condos and oceanfront lots for about $33 million. That includes millions of dollars in properties to secretive shell companies … Now, details of some of those deals and other transactions by Trump’s family business could be unmasked as special counsel Robert Mueller expands his inquiry … Federal investigators are expected to delve into records revealing some of the President’s most closely guarded secrets, including how much money he makes, who he does business with and how reliant he is on wealthy, politically-connected foreigners. Keep in mind, some of this appears to include financial activity that took place after Trump was sworn in as president. * CONGRESS’S CHECK ON TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY IS UNUSUAL: Yesterday the House voted to dramatically restrict Trump’s ability to ease sanctions on Russia, and the Washington Examiner notes the larger context: Foreign policy analysts … say that it is highly unusual for Congress to hamstring a president’s ability to conduct foreign policy. The trend over the past 25 years or so has been to show deference on these matters to the executive. “It’s unusual. The last time Congress overrode a presidential veto in a major foreign policy issue was Ronald Reagan in 1986 on South African sanctions,” said Aaron David Miller, a scholar at the Wilson Center. Between this and the failed health-care vote, it was a very bad day for the tweeter-in-chief. * RUSSIA RETALIATES OVER SANCTIONS VOTE: Meanwhile: Russia announced Friday it would seize U.S. diplomatic properties and demand that the State Department reduce its staff in Russia, a tit-for-tat punishment that the Russian Foreign Ministry said was spurred by a financial sanctions bill now awaiting a signature from President Trump. This creates a very interesting situation for Trump, who still has not said clearly whether he’ll sign the sanctions bill or veto it. * ON HEALTH CARE, DON’T FORGET THE BIG PICTURE: Paul Krugman reminds us of it: This story didn’t start in the last few weeks, or the past few months. Republicans have been denouncing Obamacare and pledging to repeal and replace it for seven years, only to be caught flat-footed when given the chance to come up with an alternative. Shouldn’t someone in the G.O.P. have asked, “Hey, guys, what is our plan, anyway? If we don’t have one, shouldn’t we consider helping make this law work?” But nobody did. Even more cynically, Republicans spent years voting to repeal the law, secure in the knowledge that Obama would veto those attempts and spare them from owning the consequences. * AND TRUMP LOVES ‘THE MOOCH’: New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci is getting lots of attention for saying really nasty stuff about other top White House people. Axios reports: The President likes people with backbone. And at the moment, Scaramucci is empowered: We’re told the President loved the Mooch quotes. But President Trump doesn’t like being upstaged. “Mini-me” can’t forget the “Mini” part. Being more Trump than Trump, in Trump’s house, is a dangerous game. The funny thing about this is that it’s entirely plausible, both in Trump’s affection for “the Mooch” and in how Trump might be conflicted over all the attention he’s getting.

"Can McConnell and Ryan be repaired, or must they be repealed and replaced?","Strong arguments can be made for removing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). After all, their leadership has sent the GOP into a death spiral — bad ideas and silly stunts chase out reasonable compromise and responsible action. Pretty soon the ordinary Republican cannot afford good ideas. The exaggerated promise to cover everyone in their respective conference in glory was not fulfilled. McConnell and Ryan have made their members more vulnerable; the least able to defend themselves will be hurt the most. The GOP agenda is dead. Gone. It’s failed. It and its authors must be replaced to end America’s suffering. Couldn’t we replace them with awesome leadership? Well, wait a minute. You cannot just remove them with no replacements in mind. Can anyone imagine Republicans in each body coalescing around a single replacement for each? I can’t either. Moderates will have their ideas, the hard-liners their own. They will float one idea (for a leader) after another, trying to see which replacement candidate clicks. At some point, they will find out that there are serious splits in each body, reflecting an inability to agree upon the end goal. You see the problem. Well, rather than repeal and replace McConnell and Ryan as leaders, could their tenures be repaired? After all, no leader is perfect, and if we can fix what is there already, we avoid the anxiety, disruption and uncertainty that change brings. What would a repair plan look like for the McConnell/Ryan leadership team? Now, the analogy to the repeal-and-replace or compromise-repair approaches for health-care reform isn’t exact, but there is a common principle: Don’t simply discard what you have in search of  a magic bullet/white knight in shining armor when you can work with what you have. We offer five suggestions for how McConnell and Ryan could recover from their monumental failure. First, no more top-down plans. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is right: Regular order, with fact-finding, hearings, input from stakeholders, amendments and votes, has to return. That’s the proper way to vet legislation and build consensus. Never again can there be votes on major legislation if its contents are unknown days or even hours before the vote. Second, turn to middle- and large-size items on which there can be some bipartisan support. A jobs training and apprenticeship bill would be a good place to start. Even the Democrats’ proposal to toughen anti-trust rules and prevent market consolidation (including the consolidation prompted by Dodd-Frank) could draw wide support. Third, on tax reform, McConnell and Ryan should avoid repeating the health-care disaster. They cannot present a bill as a fait accompli with nothing in it that Democrats would find appealing. Instead, tackle consensus items first. Rack up some wins. For example, rather than comprehensive tax reform (i.e. giant tax cuts for the rich and a massive overhaul of the individual tax code), try revenue-neutral corporate tax reform (get rid of tax expenditures that favor one industry, or in some cases, one company). Work on a deal to combine repatriation of overseas profits that can be taxed at a hugely discounted rate, with the revenue to be dedicated for infrastructure. (Companies, of course, keep the remainder, which hopefully they will use to invest in new plants, increase employee training, etc.) Fourth, it’s time to stop tolerating gross conflicts of interest, nepotism and possible emoluments-clause violations in the executive branch. Set up a joint committee, with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats, that can come up with a batch of proposals. Then take an up-or-down vote. Republicans could even make the rules all prospective — applicable to whichever candidate wins in 2020. (This might be a way to discourage Trump from running again.) First on the list must be the required disclosure of presidential candidates’ tax records. Finally, McConnell and Ryan need to bring moderates into leadership. The so-called Tuesday Group of moderates in the House and the handful of Senate moderates who helped beat back Trumpcare in the Senate have enough votes to sink major legislation. They will — fortunately from my perspective — be newly empowered after the health-care disaster. Better to have them inside the tent, able to shape the agenda, than outside and regarded as a nuisance that the right wing tries to steamroll.

"Enough about McCain. It was Collins, Murkowski and red-state Democrats who killed Trumpcare.","Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) played his hand on the Senate Republicans’ health-care proposal for the maximum political effect. It’s always the case that it’s the people who are wavering at the last minute who end up getting all the attention: Undecided voters, new car buyers, bachelorettes on reality television shows. In politics, though, there’s special cultural role acclaim for those who, at the last minute, do the unexpected — often while those who did exactly what was expected get little fanfare. This ends up yielding weird results. It’s not the politicians who’ve actively pushed for or against a measure for years, building relationships with activists and introducing legislation who get the credit for passage. It’s the guy who’s spent all that time indifferent about or hostile to the cause, who at the last minute flips his position. That’s the guy who makes the headlines. The others have to live with, you know, winning. McCain’s vote early Friday morning against the measure had been telegraphed for about an hour beforehand, but his loud “No!” of opposition was still the crack that caused the wall to crumble. Political genius. The maverick is back. Etc. But that “no” came from atop 50 other votes of opposition, not all of them easy. Any one of those 50 votes vanishes and McCain isn’t the guy who killed Trumpcare, he’s just a guy who eventually changed his mind for no real reason. In other words, those 50 people helped McCain be the political winner. Here are seven people in particular who he can thank for his victory lap this morning. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine). It’s sort of amazing that Collins hasn’t gotten more attention for her role in opposing the health-care bill this week. She was one of two Republican senators who opposed the motion-to-proceed, the procedural vote that allowed the climactic vote on Friday morning to happen at all. She was one of the three votes against the Republican bill. She also made headlines for bashing President Trump after a hearing when a live microphone caught her conversation with a colleague. The administration’s handling of the budget was just “incredibly irresponsible,” and she was “worried” about what might happen. She delivered bad headlines for Trump on three different days — yet somehow has escaped his Twitter wrath. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Murkowski did not escape that wrath. Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017  She also didn’t escape a phone call from the secretary of the interior in which projects important to her state were tacitly threatened. (That’s according to her colleague from Alaska, who received a similar call. She told reporters on Thursday that she preferred not to use the word “threat.”) Murkowski’s opposition was driven, among other things, by a desire to protect funding for Planned Parenthood, a commitment she made publicly in the state earlier this year. When McCain’s “no” became known on the floor of the Senate as voting loomed, Murkowski was swarmed by her colleagues, hoping to cajole her into flipping. As on the motion-to-proceed, which she also opposed, Murkowski didn’t budge.  Five red-state Democrats: Sens. Joe Manchin III (W. Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.) and Joe Donnelly (Ind.). The chart above picks out notable Senate votes from the failure of the Republican health-care bill. The black dots are the three Republicans who voted no. The large red dots are Republicans who, at one point or another, seemed like they might play the spoiler role that McCain embraced, including McCain’s colleague Jeff Flake. (Notice that Flake is much more conservative than McCain, by the estimate of VoteView. That certainly made a difference.) The little red, yellow and blue dots are those senators who voted as expected. That includes blue-state Democrats or the two independents who voted against the measure, as their constituents would have wanted. But the large blue dots? Those votes were almost certainly harder. Manchin’s home state of West Virginia backed Trump by a 42-point margin in 2017. By 42 points, West Virginia voters said they supported Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton, and supported his policies and leadership, including, presumably, the health-care bill that Trump wanted to see passed. His colleague, Shelley Moore Capito (R), considered voting against the effort, but ultimately stuck with her party despite being about as moderate as Murkowski. But at no point did Manchin appear to waver. Same with the other four. Their states backed Trump by an average of 23 points, but Heitkamp, Tester, McCaskill and Donnelly held firm. No on motion-to-proceed, no on the final bill. Had any of them indicated a willingness to jump ship, they’d have been embraced by the president and by Republicans in their home states (at least until reelection), but none did. Granted, this was not a popular bill. There were a slew of reasons to oppose the measure, including the way it was drafted (which was much of the reason that McCain said no). But if credit or blame is being disseminated, these seven senators deserve more of it than the senior senator from Arizona. In a 51-49 vote, every vote is the deciding vote, even the ones that were quietly there all along. "
"The Health 202: Murkowski, Collins and ... McCain sink Obamacare overhaul effort","THE PROGNOSIS Republicans' seven-year quest to wipe out President Obama's Affordable Care Act came to a crashing halt around 1:30 this morning, when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) shockingly bucked his party and voted against a scaled-down repeal bill that emerged as the Senate's last-ditch effort. It's now clear that replacing Obamacare -- or even repealing small parts of it -- may be forever a pipe dream for President Trump and the GOP, whose deep divisions over the U.S. health-care system proved unbridgeable in the end. Gasps broke out around the Senate chamber early this morning as McCain walked to the dais and uttered no"" on the ""skinny repeal"" bill. Two other Republicans -- Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- had already opposed it"
Republicans’ dream of repealing Obamacare ends,"We’ve said it before, but the Senate has reached a new low point in a once revered body. (On the bright side, at least Republicans’ hypocritical invocation of Senate traditions and Constitutional niceties need not be tolerated.) To the rescue, however, rode two brave women and a war hero stricken with cancer. Since the healthcare debate got underway, the Republican-controlled Senate has had a fundamental problem: It had no bill it could pass. We’re not talking about meeting the 60-vote threshold; they had not been able find 50 votes (plus Vice President Mike Pence’s tiebreaker) for any version of repeal and replace. So they hit upon the idea of passing an atrocious bill that would repeal the individual mandate, dumps 15 million people off healthcare insurance and raises premiums 20 percent. Then the kicker, as The Post reported Thursday: In other words, millions more people wouldn’t have insurance, and it’d be more expensive for everybody else. It’s no wonder, then, that even the Republicans who are voting for this bill don’t want it to become law. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) called it a “disaster” and a “fraud.” Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said “the only possible problem” with it is that the House might vote for it too. And Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) wants a guarantee that the House won’t turn around and pass it. Three senators actually held a press conference to say they’d vote for it — but only if they got an ironclad guarantee the House wouldn’t pass it. That’s right: They would only pass something they hate in order to kick the can down the road, with no prospect they can find a bill satisfactory to enough Senate Republicans. Really, gentleman, that’s your idea of responsible governance? Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) smartly characterized the goings on as “weapons grade bonkers.” Speaker of the House Paul Ryan tried to accommodate them, but had to hedge. “If moving forward requires a conference committee, that is something the House is willing to do,” he said in a written statement. “The House remains committed to finding a solution and working with our Senate colleagues, but the burden remains on the Senate to demonstrate that it is capable of passing something that keeps our promise.” Whatever that meant, a final (we think) vote on the skinny repeal took place in the wee hours of the night on Friday. In the end, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) — in a sort of Hollywood ending — voted no along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Susan Collins (R-Maine). The bill died, and with it perhaps, finally, the quixotic vote to end Obamacare. And what was the excuse for the rest of the Senate? They all had the power to stop a bill many openly trashed as a joke and conceded would do great damage. Nevertheless, all hoped someone else would do the dirty work of derailing it. I’m hard-pressed to think of another instance in which virtually all senators of one party (save three) declared their inability to make a critically important decision. It’s junk but send it to conference where someone else can make the tough calls.  So why are they there? The ambitious GOP senators who hid from their responsibilities have no business being in the United States Senate, let alone seeking higher office. After 7 years of protest and 7 months of legislative paralysis, Republicans have not figured out what to do about Obamacare, but they cannot admit their failure and refuse to take their medicine in the form of the base’s wrath. It took three brave souls, one in the twilight of his career, to finally put their constituents and the country above partisan hackery.

"Hey, nice state you have there Sen. Murkowski","President Trump is a transparent bluffer. He threatens to eviscerate the obligation to defend our NATO partners if attacked. He doesn’t. He threatens to pull out of NAFTA. He doesn’t. He insists Mexico will pay for the wall. He gives way on that as well. His public attacks on his own personnel and on the course of the Russian investigation should be seen in that light. Let’s look at three bluffs. Fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions? Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) warns the Judiciary Committee’s calendar is full. Translation: We won’t confirm a replacement if he fires Sessions. Trump will have an acting attorney general. If he fires deputy attorney general Rod. J. Rosenstein too, he’ll have an acting AG and an acting DAG. Not only would he then be stuck with Rachel Brand or a permanent civil service replacement in charge of the Russia investigation, but also he would lose his strongest advocate for a set of policies (which I strenuously object to, but that is neither here nor there) that Sessions has championed including the Muslim ban, the attack on so-called sanctuary cities, mandatory minimums and civil forfeiture. Frankly, Democrats would celebrate if Trump had the nerve to can Sessions — they’d get rid of a nemesis on a host of issues, see a firestorm and likely be able to hold off on the confirmation of a Trump loyalist. Next, is the extortion threat — well, not exactly extortion but close — his interior secretary lobbed at Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) for having the temerity to vote against proceeding to a non-bill that would undo Obamacare with no substitute in reach: Early Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter to express displeasure with Murkowski’s vote. By that afternoon, each of Alaska’s two Republican senators had received a phone call from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke letting them know the vote had put Alaska’s future with the administration in jeopardy. The response follows Trump’s no-holds-barred style of governing, even when it comes to his own party. It is his first strike of retaliation against Murkowski, however, despite her tendency to stray from the party line and the president’s priorities. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan said the call from Zinke heralded a “troubling message.” “I’m not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,” Sullivan said. If Sullivan had the nerve, he’d inform the White House that under no conditions would he submit to blackmail. He therefore would have no choice but to oppose any Trumpcare measure, especially since wrecking the exchanges (the outcome of the so-called skinny repeal) would cause widespread suffering in his state. Does he have that sort of spine? I fear he does not, but he’d be smart to call the president’s bluff. Trump doesn’t have the power to put a state’s “future . . .  in jeopardy.” Congress has the power of the purse and the Senate the power of confirmation. You’d think Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would have the guts to defend his own member, and the Senate as a whole, from this sort of vindictiveness. Don’t hold your breath. Then there is the threat to fire Robert S. Mueller III. That, it seems, is a more immediate threat and one Trump might want to act upon. Trump for now is trying to smear and undermine the investigation. At some point, when presented with a demand for documents or request for testimony, he might have no choice in his mind but to fire Mueller. And even before that point Trump may truly believe his financial and legal interests would be imperiled if Mueller kept digging, he might very well pull the trigger. He has every reason to doubt that the Republicans would bolt at that point. Would Republicans actually commence impeachment hearings? Subpoena his taxes? Pursue violations of the emoluments clause? Even many neutral observes would bet no; Trump surely could convince himself this would be the best course. In sum, Trump is ultimately a coward who has backed down when presented with a united front. Republicans have the power to call his bluff. They need to man up and do so.

Will the Trump administration ever be held accountable for its abuses? Here’s one way it might.,"THE MORNING PLUM: The GOP campaign for a health-care overhaul, which faces a critical moment this week, has been absolutely saturated from top to bottom with bad faith and scandalously brazen abuses of our governing norms for months. We’ve seen endless lies about the Affordable Care Act and the possible GOP replacement; an unprecedentedly secretive and rushed process in the GOP-led Congress; attacks on the legitimacy of nonpartisan budget scorekeepers; and the apparent use of taxpayer funds to promote the Republican replacement and undermine the ACA. But it turns out that we just might see a little accountability soon enough. No, really. Here’s how: The Government Accountability Office, the leading auditor of the federal government, has formally agreed to a request by Democrats for an examination of whether the Trump administration has been violating the law by using government resources to promote the Republican replacement plan, I’ve learned. If the GAO concludes that the administration’s conduct is violating the law, that could put increased pressure on it to refrain from these tactics, or on congressional Republicans to exercise their own oversight of them. Given that the repeal push could drag on for weeks or months longer, this could matter. The GAO has sent a letter to Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) announcing its formal intention to examine the conduct of the Department of Health and Human Services for possible lawbreaking. Murray and three other Democrats recently sent their own letter to the GAO and the U.S. inspector general requesting an examination of whether HHS is engaging in a “pattern” of “using federal resources to advance partisan legislation.” The Democrats’ letter cited the use of HHS’s official Twitter accounts to attack the ACA and promote the GOP replacement. It also raised questions as to whether HHS is using taxpayer funds to produce video testimonials of people criticizing the ACA, which would violate the prohibition on an agency “engaging in covert propaganda,” the Democrats’ letter says. The GAO will now examine this conduct. “GAO accepts your request as work that is within the scope of its authority,” the GAO’s letter says, adding that the work of providing a “legal opinion” on HHS’s conduct will begin “shortly.” The Daily Beast recently reported in a detailed exposé that under HHS Secretary Tom Price, the agency has spent taxpayer money originally earmarked for encouraging ACA enrollment on a public relations campaign that uses many of those tactics to undermine the law and promote the GOP replacement for it. Among these tactics are heavy investments in producing anti-ACA social media content, including videos shot at HHS’s internal studio that featured ordinary Americans flown in to criticize the law. The Daily Beast story noted that this broad campaign is “far more robust and sustained than has been publicly revealed,” leading Democrats to question whether HHS is “abdicating its responsibilities to administer the law” while sabotaging it in an effort to facilitate its undoing. The letter from Democrats — which is also signed by Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Reps. Richard Neal (Mass.) and Frank Pallone (N.J.) — asked the GAO to look at whether such tactics violate federal laws that prohibit the use of taxpayer money to “influence” Congress or “ban certain electronic communications, covert propaganda, and grass roots lobbying.” Now the GAO has agreed to do so. The larger story here is that even in moments of unified control of the White House and Congress, the minority has some limited tactics at its disposal. The GAO’s reports are public, and its findings about presidencies in both parties can make news, such as when the GAO found that the Environmental Protection Agency under Barack Obama violated the law with a social media push for a water rule. “GAO is an extraordinarily valuable tool for provoking oversight — it gives the minority a key tool,” Sarah Binder, a congressional expert at George Washington University, told me today. “If taxpayer dollars are being used to sabotage the law, that’s a constitutional problem.” “GAO is an arm of Congress, but it’s fiercely independent and filled with impressive expertise,” congressional scholar Norm Ornstein added. “If GAO finds malfeasance by HHS, it is a big deal — impossible for Paul Ryan and Republicans to ignore.” Given the enormous range of norm-shredding we’ve seen under Trump and this Congress, this might seem like a small matter. But, should the GAO agree with Democrats, it won’t be a small thing. It will shine additional light on one of the leading tactics employed by the Trump administration, as part of a broader health-overhaul campaign that has been marked by abuses of our democratic and governing processes on multiple levels for months. And every little effort at accountability matters. * EVEN ‘SKINNY REPEAL’ WOULD LEAVE MILLIONS UNINSURED: The Congressional Budget Office has weighed in on the “skinny” bill that Senate Republicans may vote on today, which would repeal only the mandates and the medical device tax: Democrats on Wednesday night released a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the effects of repealing several provisions that could be part of a “skinny” repeal measure. The analysis found that the number of uninsured people would increase by 15 million next year compared with current law, and Democrats said they were told that premiums would be roughly 20 percent higher. Of course, Republicans say they want this bill only so that they can get to conference negotiations with the House. But if so, they’d then negotiate on a bill that would leave many more people without coverage. * HOW REPUBLICANS HOPE TO SALVAGE REPEAL: The Post reports that Sen. John Thune of (R-S.D.) candidly explained what will happen if “skinny repeal” passes this way: Thune said … leaders were betting that some Republicans who defected on votes this week would feel more pressure to support any bill that emerged from negotiations with the House to face a final vote in the Senate. “Voting on something at the end of the process when it’s the only train leaving the station … I think that’s a different vote for a lot of people,” he said. Game plan: Use “skinny repeal” to get to conference to make it harder for GOP moderates to oppose whatever awful product emerges at the end, when the pressure for passage will be really intense. * KEY GOP SENATORS UNDECIDED ON ‘SKINNY REPEAL’: Politico reports that moderates such as Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Rob Portman (Ohio) remain undecided on the skinny bill. Meanwhile, conservatives such as Rand Paul (Ky.) and David Perdue (Ga.) are wary, because you never know what could emerge from conference. At the same time, Roll Call reports that Sen. Jerry Moran (Kan.) worries about going to conference without a broader proposal agreed upon among GOP senators. If only three Republicans defect, even skinny repeal dies. * GOP GOVERNORS BLAST ‘SKINNY REPEAL’: Ten governors, including Republicans Brian Sandoval of Nevada and John Kasich of Ohio, have released a letter blasting “skinny repeal” as a threat to their states. The letter says it would “accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage.” In other words: It would cause the death spirals and rising premiums that Republicans have exaggeratedly ascribed to the ACA. One question is whether Sandoval’s criticism weighs on Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.). * TOP TRUMP ADVISERS CONDEMN ATTACKS ON SESSIONS: With Trump’s assaults on Attorney General Jeff Sessions continuing, the New York Times reports that top White House advisers are now leaking like sieves: Among those urging Mr. Trump to spare Mr. Sessions have been Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist; and Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, according to officials who asked not to be named describing internal deliberations. Well, at least there is some level of lawlessness on Trump’s part that these good people don’t want to be associated with. * SHREDDING OF OUR NORMS IS UNFOLDING ON MULTIPLE FRONTS: E.J. Dionne Jr. has a great column linking two separate storylines — Trump’s ongoing norm-shredding assault on Sessions and the GOP’s ongoing norm-shredding health-care repeal push: Our country is now as close to crossing the line from democracy to autocracy as it has been in our lifetimes … But where are the leaders of the Republican Party in the face of the dangers Trump poses? They’re trying to sneak through a health-care bill by violating every reasonable standard citizens should impose on public servants dealing with legislation that affects more than one-sixth of our economy. Who cares about our democracy when there’s a safety net to shred and taxes on the rich to cut? * AND DID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THREATEN MURKOWSKI? The Alaska Dispatch News reports that Trump’s rage at Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) for opposing the health-care bill may have resulted this week in a none-too-subtle administration threat: By that afternoon, each of Alaska’s two Republican senators had received a phone call from Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke letting them know the vote had put Alaska’s future with the administration in jeopardy …. Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan said the call from Zinke heralded a “troubling message … I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop.” Remember, this is because Trump, who doesn’t care in the least about the specifics of the bill he signs, wants the pleasure of wiping his feet on something with Barack Obama’s name on it.

"Defeated on Obamacare, the GOP struggles to save face","Before delving into the particulars of the GOP’s failed health-care bills or the destructive and purposeless “skinny repeal” plan, we should not lose track of a defining, historic moment for the Republican Party: The GOP is unable to repeal the Affordable Care Act or replace and repeal the ACA after seven years of histrionics and with control of the Senate, House and White House. Take that in. The GOP has failed to make good on its “promise” — not because the party is cowardly but because what it promised is so objectionable even to its own members. To lose 43-57 and then 45-55 on two versions of repeal is a remarkable display of intellectual and political decrepitude. The Post recaps: The Senate rejected a proposal Wednesday that would have repealed major parts of the Affordable Care Act, but Republican leaders were growing more confident about their chances of passing a more modest overhaul of the health-care law later this week. … More than half a dozen centrists from states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act objected to the original Senate draft that was considered on Tuesday night. It would have cut the program for low-income Americans by $772 billion over 10 years and curtailed its long-term growth rate. Yet even if Republicans agree on a minimalist plan to alter the ACA, uniting with their House colleagues to enact a bill would be far more challenging. On Wednesday — even before the skinny repeal came up for a vote — some House conservatives were calling it untenable. At least Republicans now have clarity: The efforts to slash Medicaid, a position taken by a majority of House Republicans (including many moderates); to give huge tax cuts to the rich; and to eliminate the protections for preexisting conditions and the requirement for a minimum set of benefits have failed. The touchstones of conservative health-care policy have taken Republicans into a legislative cul-de-sac. They are left spinning their wheels as the reality of their political predicament sinks in. (The Post explains that “in two votes over the past 24 hours, lawmakers rejected differing approaches to rewriting the landmark 2010 law. The open voting process — which is likely to drag on for the rest of the week — has laid bare the fact that Senate Republicans haven’t been able to find a comprehensive replacement for the law they have relentlessly lambasted.”) Before addressing the skinny repeal, let’s note once again that moderate Republicans who voted to “get on the bill” had no viable plan to replace Obamacare. One must ask once again how lawmakers such as Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) — who expressly promised not to “hurt people” and not to proceed without a replacement plan — rationalized their vote on Tuesday afternoon to proceed with debate. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) went to the floor late in the day on Wednesday to review the bidding. “Clearly the Senate Republican bill — repeal and replace — has failed. Sen. Paul’s bill — repeal without replace — has failed. We know the Republicans are not going to take a final vote on the underlying House bill, which is still the pending legislation,” he said. “And now the Republican leadership team, unmistakably at the direction of the leader, has been telling the press about a yet-to-be-disclosed final bill. If the reports are true, the Republicans will offer a ‘skinny’ repeal plan. We just heard from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that under such a plan, as reported in the press, 16 million Americans would lose their health insurance and millions more would pay a 20 percent increase in their premiums. At least 20 percent.” Huh? Yup. The GOP can no longer do what it promised or do what it wants, so it’ll do something no one wants that will have nothing but negative results. According to reports, the plan would repeal the individual and employer mandates and the medical device tax. That’s it. It knocks out the individual mandate, thereby making the adverse selection problem more acute and hastening the death spiral they falsely claim is already happening. Rather than lower premium costs, lower deductibles, lure insurers back to the exchanges or improve access to coverage, the GOP’s repeal of the individual mandate will raise premium costs, raise deductibles, chase insurers from the exchanges and price millions of people out of the individual market. In sum, it cannot repeal or repeal and replace Obamacare, so it will destroy health-care insurance coverage for millions. No wonder governors of both parties reacted angrily. In a letter released Wednesday night, a bipartisan group of 10 governors stated: We agree with Senator John McCain that the Senate should “return to regular order,” working across the aisle to “provide workable solutions to problems Americans are struggling with today.” Congress should be working to make health insurance more affordable while stabilizing the health insurance market, but this bill and similar proposals won’t accomplish these goals. The bill still threatens coverage for millions of hardworking, middle class Americans. The bill’s Medicaid provisions shift costs to states and fail to provide the necessary resources to ensure that no one is left out, including the working poor or those suffering from mental illness or addiction. The Senate should also reject efforts to amend the bill into a “skinny repeal,” which is expected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage. They pleaded with the Senate “to work with governors on solutions to problems we can all agree on: fixing our unstable insurance markets. Improvements should be based on a set of guiding principles, which include controlling costs and stabilizing the market, that will positively impact the coverage and care of millions of Americans, including many who are dealing with mental illness, chronic health problems, and drug addiction.” No one who understands health insurance thinks the skinny repeal would actually improve the health-care insurance market. The Wall Street Journal reports: Health insurers came out strongly against the idea of any bare-bones health-care bill that would repeal the ACA’s coverage mandate without other measures aimed at stabilizing the law’s insurance exchanges. “If there is no longer a requirement for everyone to purchase coverage, it is critical that any legislation include strong incentives for people to obtain health insurance and keep it year-round,” the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement. “A system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone.” We find interest in the skinny repeal inexplicable. It solves no problem; it makes insurance coverage more expensive. It does not create cheaper options for coverage. It serves only one purpose: to provide a fig leaf for Republicans bereft of ideas as to how to improve health care. The notion that passage of unworkable skinny-repeal legislation would at least result in a conference with the House reveals how unseriously GOP senators take their job. (What if the House simply approves the Senate bill?) Moreover, supposing there would be a conference, Republican senators’ approach  begs the question: If they get to conference, what kind of bill could they possibly agree upon? To accomplish what? Republicans’ health-care efforts no longer have any coherent purpose. They take votes for the sake of voting. They need to stop before real people suffer.

MAD magazine skewers Trumpcare with this scathing Al Jaffee ‘fold-in’,"AL JAFFEE, at age 96, has a few words for Donald Trump about how the president is handling health care. A few pictures, too. Jaffee is not only the longest-working cartoonist in comics history, as recognized last year by Guinness World Records, but the MAD magazine legend is also the father of the “fold-in,” the publication’s back-page feature that reveals a surprise message and image once the illustration’s middle section is collapsed. And on Friday, MAD will digitally publish Jaffee’s latest fold-in, in which the cartoonist asks: “Who stands to benefit most from Trumpcare?” Here’s an exclusive sneak peek of his art: Jaffee then offers his dire reply (complete with two-word caption), which reflects reports that tens of millions of Americans will lose their health coverage if the government repeals and replaces the Affordable Care Act, which Congress continues to debate. His pointed verdict is viewed when you fold in the sides as such: “The fold-in is a sort of bait-and-switch process,” Jaffee tells The Washington Post’s Comic Riffs. “The full-page scene asks and illustrates a question. After the page is folded, a surprise new scene and answer appear. “In that way,” he continues, “it’s not very different from what the Republicans did during the last election with the health-care plan.” For part of his childhood, Jaffee grew up poor on a shtetl in Zarasai — “the Siberia of Lithuania,” he says — and those years fostered not only his artistic creativity, but also his distrust of adult authority. He says he has little patience for bloviators, and that, unfortunately, the world is stocked full of them. [A MAD magazine cartoonist shows how growing up poor sparks creativity] Jaffee began satirizing political candidates in MAD’s pages in the ’60s, and his fold-ins have appeared in nearly every issue since 1964. MAD’s editor in chief, John Ficarra, relishes that after a half-century, Jaffee’s art still delivers the spit and vinegar of acidic satire. “Al has written and illustrated almost 500 fold-ins for MAD,” Ficarra says, “and he never stops surprising us.” The new MAD issue, which also features an extended “Trump Art Gallery” of visual spoofs of famed artists, hits newsstands Aug. 8.

A defensive vote on an offensive bill,"Republicans’ desperation to pass something, anything, that they can call “Obamacare repeal” and their total lack of concern for the health-care insurance that millions of Americans depend upon have never been more vivid. All Republicans but Sens. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine) voted to advance a bill — some kind of bill — that, from what we have seen, would dump millions off the Medicaid rolls, raise insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs for many of President Trump’s voters and return millions in tax cuts to the rich. But we don’t know, and neither does any senator know, where this is going or what consequences might flow. The greatest deliberative body now looks like a bunch of teenagers out for a joy ride. (The reason? They said they’d wreck the family car and they’ll look foolish if they renege.) The vote delayed the huge embarrassment that will await them when the Senate in all likelihood will fail to repeal and replace Obamacare. The excuse that senators were just voting to begin debate didn’t fit well with the promise made by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). She had said she “did not come to Washington to hurt people” and would only vote to advance a bill that would help her constituents. She wound up voting for something that may very well result in huge pain and suffering for the thousands of her constituents who are on Medicaid and/or need opioid addiction treatment. She either lied or changed her mind. Republicans’ defense that this was just a vote to begin debate will do Sens. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and others up for reelection in 2018 little good when the ads start flying. They voted for uncertainty and confusion, to endanger health care of the most vulnerable with no clue how they would replace it. They cannot escape blame for whatever happens. In the first major vote after the motion to proceed, the Senate emphatically rejected (43-57) a measure that would have combined the Senate Better Care Reconciliation Act with an amendment from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to allow insurers to offer an unregulated plan along with Obamacare-compliant plans and a separate amendment from Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) to add funds back to help those the GOP bill threw off Medicaid. There will be more votes on more versions of Trumpcare in the next day or so. Rather than repeal and replace Obamacare, Senate Republicans at some point may vote to disable Obamacare and do nothing about the consequences. That, in a nutshell, is what the so-called skinny repeal bill is all about. It’s not a repeal bill at all. The Post reports: “The ‘skinny repeal’ option would repeal the ACA’s mandates that both individuals buy plans and that employers with 50 or more employees provide coverage, according to lobbyists and Senate aides, as well as eliminate the law’s tax on medical device manufacturers.” That, of course, would further destabilize the exchanges, accelerating the death spiral, and would put at risk millions covered by employer insurance. It does nothing about any problem that Republicans have identified (e.g. premiums too high, deductibles too high, insurers abandoning the exchanges). When the Congressional Budget Office previously scored repeal of the individual mandate, it found: “About 2 million fewer people would have employment-based coverage, about 6 million fewer people would obtain nongroup policies (insurance people can purchase directly either in the marketplaces or from insurers outside the marketplaces), and about 7 million fewer people would have coverage under Medicaid. All together, the agencies estimate, 43 million people would be uninsured in 2026.” In addition, the left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress found that if the individual mandate were repealed, a “20 percent increase in individual market premiums next year [would occur and] would mean that the average premium in insurance marketplace would be about $1,238 higher than it would otherwise be under current law.” No wonder the GOP is not predicting that this will pass. Perhaps it should provide a score, a hearing or two and a rationalization for this latest gambit. (It would be fun, however, to watch GOP hard-liners vote to keep the vast majority of Obamacare provisions, including Medicaid expansion, on the books.) Never have we seen such a chaotic, rash legislative process on such a serious matter. Republicans throw around one idea after another with no systematic analysis or input from doctors, insurers, governors, etc. But look on the bright side: In sum, the consolation for a meltdown in legislative order, rationality and responsible government is that we now know just how incapable the GOP is of governing. Years of antagonism toward government have made them cavalier about the harm they can do to ordinary citizens in their quest to avoid blame. What a shabby group they are. Let’s hope they don’t do real damage before they lose their majority.

The Daily 202: Senate Republicans still face narrow path to pass health-care bill after procedural victory,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Republican Sens. John Cornyn (Tex.) and John Barrasso (Wyo.) leave the Senate chamber after Vice President Pence breaks a 50-50 tie to formally open debate on Republican health-care legislation. (Oliver Contreras For The Washington Post) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Mitch McConnell is like a quarterback who has just converted on fourth and long. The Senate majority leader kept the drive to repeal Obamacare alive, but he’s still trailing by a touchdown, the game clock keeps ticking down and a win is not inevitable. -- He didn’t have a single vote to spare, but the Kentuckian demonstrated impressive legislative prowess by getting 50 Republican senators to vote for the motion to proceed to debate on the health-care bill. It was high political theater: John McCain, recovering from surgery and battling brain cancer, traveled 2,300 miles from Arizona. As police removed protesters yelling “kill the bill” from the gallery, Wisconsin’s Ron Johnson (who has been a holdout in recent weeks) held off on voting until he saw what the outcome was going to be. Vice President Pence then cast a tiebreaking vote. -- But last night underscored what a tough row to hoe this remains. The rules of the body mean that any senator can now submit amendments that need to be voted on. This leads to what’s called a vote-o-rama, an often chaotic and sometimes unpredictable process. The first item members took up last night was the Better Care Reconciliation Act. That is the carefully negotiated package that McConnell spent weeks crafting, with compromises to get conservatives like Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and moderates like Rob Portman (R-Ohio) on board. But nine Republicans broke ranks and voted no. The diversity of those who opposed the measure underscored the ideological split within the Republican conference about the best path forward on health care. The group included moderates like Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), as well as conservative purists like Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Also voting no were Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). -- President Trump, who has stepped up his efforts in recent days to get a bill done, marveled yesterday at the small margin for error. “It’s a very, very difficult situation,” he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, “because you move a little to the left, and you lose four guys. You move a little bit to the right, and all of a sudden you have a bloc of people who are gone. You have a one-inch road and it wheels through the middle of the valley.” -- Senators will next cast an up-or-down vote on whether to completely repeal Obamacare. The vote could come as early as today. It will fail. The only question is how many Republicans vote against it. Two years ago, all but one of them voted for the identical measure — when they knew that it was only for show and Barack Obama would veto it. -- It’s hard to overstate the degree to which White House officials and Senate GOP leaders just want to pass something — really, anything — to show the base that they are keeping their promise to roll back Obamacare. They would happily portray even most modest tweaks to the Affordable Care Act as major successes to save face. As far as they’re concerned, whatever gets passed will be the basis for negotiations with the House. So this is not even a final product. That’s where what’s being called “skinny repeal” comes in. “The ‘skinny repeal’ option would repeal the ACA’s mandates that individuals buy plans and that employers with 50 or more employees provide coverage … as well as eliminate the law’s tax on medical device manufacturers,” Sean Sullivan, Juliet Eilperin and Kelsey Snell explain. “This … strategy would keep the overhaul effort alive but amount to a tacit acknowledgment that broader efforts to revise or repeal the law cannot succeed ... The conservative group Freedom Partners (backed by the Koch political network), urged senators to use the votes to partly repeal the law and then keep pushing for full repeal. … But one key way Senate leaders won Tuesday’s procedural vote was by assuring several centrist Republicans that they may end up with a modest bill.” The devil is in the details. Kim Soffen and Kevin Schaul have created a cool graphics page to track some of the most significant amendments expected to come up in the next few days, along with which senators to watch for each one. “There has been a mismatch all along between many of the Republicans’ critiques of current law and the likely outcomes of their reforms,” Margot Sanger-Katz writes in the New York Times. “But earlier bills grappled with the issues by trying to deregulate insurance markets or provide stabilization funds, even if analyses suggested that the changes would still increase consumer costs and the number of Americans without insurance. A skinny repeal bill, instead, leaves those policy goals to the side in an effort to find a slender majority of votes.” -- Keep in mind: Opening floor debate may be a Pyrrhic victory for the GOP: Democrats are going to force Republicans to cast some uncomfortable votes in the coming days as part of the freewheeling amendment process. Regardless of whether a bill ultimately passes, and how they try to spin it, every senator who voted for the motion to proceed just gave years of fodder to Democratic admakers. “These votes, frankly, are a lot tougher for them than they are for us,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “They are squeezed in both directions.” McConnell, for his part, warned his members that voters “expect us to tackle the big problems.” “So all we have to do today is to have the courage to begin the debate,” the GOP leader said in a floor speech. “Let the voting take us where it will.” THE MAC IS BACK: -- “John McCain, maverick of the Senate, did not return to Capitol Hill and suddenly stop the progress of the Republican health-care effort. But the Arizona Republican, now battling an aggressive form of brain cancer, did use his moment in the spotlight Tuesday to deliver a sobering message to colleagues,” Elise Viebeck, Paul Kane and Ed O'Keefe report. “The Senate might be known as the world’s greatest deliberative body, McCain said, but it is not clear it deserves that reputation today. The partisanship, the gridlock and the political subterfuge have dragged down the institution, he said. Senators’ work is ‘more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time I remember,’ McCain told a rapt audience on the Senate floor. ‘Our deliberations can still be important and useful, but I think we’d all agree they haven’t been overburdened by greatness lately. And right now, they aren’t producing much for the American people.’” (Read Kane’s column about McCain’s emotional return.) Even though he delivered a pivotal vote to move the health-care debate forward, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee publicly criticized his party’s leaders for their lack of transparency and suggested that a bill may not ultimately pass. “We’ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it’s better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition,” McCain said. “I don’t think that’s going to work in the end, and it probably shouldn’t … “Let’s trust each other,” he added. “Let’s return to regular order. We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That’s an approach that’s been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires.” HOW IT’S PLAYING BACK HOME: -- Arizona Republic: “It won't take long to see whether McCain's message dented the partisan stalemate on Republican efforts to overhaul the Affordable Care Act. Both sides are expected to wrangle for the rest of the week over competing versions of the health-care bill to see if any ideas can muster a majority.” -- Denver Post: “Cory Gardner votes to advance Senate GOP health care bill but circumspect on what comes next. Regardless, Colorado Republican plans to pitch idea involving private insurance for low-income residents.” -- Alaska Dispatch News: “Alaska's senior Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said Tuesday that her decision to vote no on beginning debate on health care legislation was a last-minute decision. In the end, an allegiance to ‘the process’ won out.” -- Las Vegas Sun: “[Sen. Dean Heller] voted in support of a motion to push forward with efforts to roll back Obamacare. … He noted that his vote to proceed was not a vote in favor of the GOP bill. … Rep. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who is running against Heller next year, said in a statement after today's vote that Heller folded under pressure from President Donald Trump and GOP leaders.” -- Charleston Gazette-Mail: “Following the roll call, [Sen. Shelley Moore] Capito said she expects that the final Senate version will put more money into combating the worsening opioid epidemic and beefing up the Patient and State Stability Fund, which would soften the blow of some of the lost federal funding.” -- Columbus Dispatch: “Despite his sharp criticisms of nearly every health-care bill pushed by Republican leadership this year, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman sided with party leaders Tuesday to keep alive the GOP effort to dismantle and replace Obamacare.” WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: Rick Perry. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) GET SMART FAST:​​ TRUMP VS. SESSIONS: -- The public standoff between Trump and Jeff Sessions escalated Tuesday: The president criticized his attorney general on Twitter, in a news conference and during a newspaper interview, and Sessions says he plans to stand his ground. Devlin Barrett, Philip Rucker and Sari Horwitz report: “Trump was asked at a Rose Garden news conference if he would fire the attorney general … ‘We’ll see what happens,’’ said Trump — a potentially ominous choice of phrase, considering the president used the same expression when talking [about fired FBI Director James Comey] ... It is unheard of for a Cabinet-level official to be subjected to such visceral and public criticism, which has now gone on for a week. But Sessions showed no sign of buckling ... and in fact his position was bolstered by support from prominent conservatives taking his side.”  -- Movement conservatives are very angry at Trump for going after one of their best allies in government: Breitbart, which has been Trump's staunchest defender in right-wing media and was formerly run by Bannon, posted an article saying the president’s attacks on Sessions “only serves to highlight Trump’s own hypocrisy” and it warned that firing Sessions would “fuel concerns from his base.” The lead story overnight was headlined: “Trump vs. Trump: Potus Endangers Immigration Agenda.” The banner on the Drudge Report is: “Sessions in Dog House; Republicans on Brink of Civil War.” Hard choice! Risk the future of the country (immigration) or score a few political points (Hillary)? https://t.co/0roWRpTBCN -- Frustration from the base has been building for a while, and the Sessions donnybrook has prompted some pro-Trump thought leaders to speak out: “Weeks ago, Mr. Bannon brought Ann Coulter, the firebrand pundit, to see Mr. Trump … Ms. Coulter railed at the president that he needed to focus more on his core supporters,” per the New York Times. ‘If an early supporter like this is thrown under the bus"
Jeff Sessions has done more for Trumpism than anyone. Trump still wants to ditch him.,"President Trump feels the hot breath of the Russia investigation on his neck: He’s tweeting heedlessly, almost maniacally, as special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s team methodically grinds its way toward the president’s tax returns and business records. Meanwhile, his hollow White House “functions” amid any number of warring, perpetually shifting factions, a cluster of Borgias on the Potomac, watching for any sign of less-than-unconditional fealty, of daggers hidden in sleeves, and of poisoned goblets. “We could use some more loyalty,” the president told Boy Scouts on Monday night. Too bad he’s been lashing out at the one person in his administration who’s loyally moved his agenda forward — Attorney General Jeff Sessions. First, Trump went on the record with his (sometimes) bête noire, the New York Times, to gripe that Sessions recusing himself on Russia matters was “very unfair to the president.” Next, Trump took to Twitter to blast Sessions for having “taken a VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes.” Then, Tuesday, standing next to Lebanon’s prime minister at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, Trump said he was “very disappointed with the attorney general” but only “time will tell” his fate. Never mind that recusal was the proper path and virtually no one, except Trump, faulted Sessions’s decision. Which really tells you all you need to know about Trump: Sessions has done more, in six months, to advance the weird brew of nationalism and big-government-ism that is Trumpism, than anyone. But to Trump, personal loyalty — and, perhaps, a plausible route to ridding himself of Mueller — is what matters. Over the years, Trump has betrayed a string of people who’ve trusted him in marriage, business and politics; his idea of loyalty is a steep, slippery, one-way street. And if Sessions didn’t know it before, now he does. [If you work for Trump, it’s time to quit] He was unquestionably, and crucially loyal to Trump during the 2016 campaign. When then-Sen. Sessions appeared onstage at a Trump rally in Mobile, Ala., on a humid night in August 2015, donned the infamous “Make America Great Again” hat, and later, in February 2016, formally endorsed then-candidate Trump, he validated the president to many in Washington. After all, Washington had always viewed the Alabama senator as a serious conservative. If Sessions could find a way to #MAGA, couldn’t they? In the Acela Corridor’s media ecosystem, he was a tireless promoter of Trump’s shambolic gaffe machine. His Justice Department has fought rabidly to defend Trump’s clumsy, ill-conceived Muslim travel ban. As attorney general, Sessions is on the tip of the Spear of Steves — the Stephen Bannon-Stephen Miller anti-immigrant push, as his “This is the Trump era” speech on the U.S.-Mexico border signaled in April. In many ways, Trump’s immigration policies were shaped by Sessions, a man he now reviles. Miller, once a Sessions acolyte, remains in the White House, his silence loudly suggesting that he’s content to let his old boss twist in the wind. Over the past decade, conservatives have taken a hard look at criminal justice reform and concluded that our long-standing, tough-on-crime political war led to a system that was too punitive, too reflexive and too racially separate — to the point that just about the only bipartisan thing going in Washington right now is the joint bail reform initiative of conservatarian Sen. Rand Paul and San Francisco liberal Sen. Kamala Harris. But the Sessions Justice Department, consonant with the swaggering lock-’em-up rhetoric of the Trump campaign, has ordered federal prosecutors to aim for the toughest penalties in every case. Criminal justice reform is for losers. Sad. Non-Trump conservatives find the Sessions Justice Department’s expansive statism hard to swallow; his reiteration of the tried-and-failed War on Drugs is particularly repellent to those who claim to believe in federalism. Despite decades of Republicans advocating for power to flow back to the states and away from one-size-fits-all Washington regulatory and legal control, the “beleaguered” attorney general’s almost obsessive anti-drug crusade has focused on states that have passed marijuana decriminalization and legalization. Just the kind of showy but ineffective and unconservative policy that Trump routinely favors. Sessions reversed an Obama-era reform that had been heralded across the political spectrum when he reapplied civil asset forfeiture regulations, allowing law enforcement agencies to seize property for people suspected of crimes — a move that law professor and conservative USA Today columnist Glenn Harlan Reynolds rightly argues is a message that “the feds see the rest of us as prey, not as citizens.” Not a huge surprise coming from the Trump-Sessions Justice Department. [Jeff Sessions isn’t making America safer. He might be making it more dangerous.] Sessions even announced he won’t keep the National Commission on Forensic Science, an advisory panel formed during the Obama years with this heretofore not-so-controversial aim: “to raise forensic science standards.” So much for enriching the ability to study evidence of crimes, both to convict the guilty and to exonerate the innocent. With the possible exception of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Sessions has been arguably the most successful Cabinet member — if success is defined as advancing the agenda of the guy who installed you in your post (crazy, I know). Russian President Vladimir Putin and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner seem to run more of our foreign policy decisions than Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is hip deep in the still-unfolding Trumpcare fiasco. The rest of the lot serve mostly as props for Dear Leader-y Cabinet meetings and stage-fodder for press events. But even in his rush to stroke Trump’s ego, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus thanked Trump for “the opportunity and blessing that you’ve given us to serve your agenda.” Your agenda, Mr. President, not you. An agenda that most Americans find repellent, but that, for better or worse, is exactly what President Trump campaigned on and what his base wants. And Sessions is doing everything he can to make good on it, cashing in his decades of Washington experience, a reputation as a serious Washington player and his newfound clout as an undying Trump loyalist. He took office and started putting “wins” on the board for Team Trump. (“So much winning” that, indeed, I’m already “bored” with it.) All he’s left out is the one thing Trump most desires: someone to slam the brakes on the multiple, burgeoning, Russia investigations. Whether Trump fires him, he’s damaged his hand-picked attorney general — and Sessions’s ability to press the administration’s agenda — beyond repair. It wasn’t enough for this president. Nothing ever is. "
Here’s how local TV news is making it harder for the Senate to repeal Obamacare,"Senate Republicans voted Tuesday night to open debate on repealing and possibly replacing the Affordable Care Act — the first iteration of which promptly stumbled on procedural grounds. But does any proposal have enough support to pass? The ACA repeal was always going to be a tough, uphill battle in the Senate, as we explained here in May. The stakes are high — both for the millions of Americans who now have insurance through Obamacare, and for the Republican Party that promised to repeal it. Senate efforts have failed so far for a variety of reasons. But here’s one that hasn’t yet been explored: local television news. That drumbeat of coverage in their home districts during Senate debates may have made some GOP senators think twice about angering constituents — including those of their own party. [Why can’t the Senate repeal Obamacare? Because its policies are actually popular] Here’s how we did our research Most Americans get the largest part of their information about health policy from the news media. Despite the broad political attention to national and cable broadcast outlets, local television has larger audiences and has been cited as an influential source. We have been tracking local television news coverage of health-care reform in all 210 media markets across the United States since the American Health Care Act was unveiled in early March. We’ve done this by searching a database of the closed captioning for all evening local television news broadcasts (from 4 p.m. to midnight) on local stations affiliated with the four major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox). We search for key words used in the closed captioning of local broadcast news, including various spellings of and references to Obamacare, ACA, AHCA, Trumpcare, health reform or health insurance. We have removed multiple hits within programs, and plotted the cumulative total of newscasts with keyword hits for all weekdays in the figure below. Here’s how local media attention to health-care reform may have made a difference Local television news discussed health-care reform extensively between the day that House Republicans first revealed details about the American Health Care Act and March 24, the day that Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told the president that they didn’t have the votes to pass the bill. When the AHCA was revived with newly proposed amendments in late April, coverage picked up again, jumping on May 4, when the House passed the bill. Our hunch is that local TV covered the ACA and the AHCA quite differently. When we did an in-depth analysis of 2013-2014 ACA news coverage, we found that local TV was more likely to focus on political conflict and its winners and losers than on the policy details of the law. While we have not yet conducted that careful analysis on AHCA coverage, we expect that it has been different. For one, the AHCA sought to change some of the most popular (and not previously well-covered in the news) ACA provisions, like a ban on denying health insurance because of preexisting conditions and minimum coverage requirements for all health insurance plans. [Here are the 4 reasons Mitch McConnell couldn’t get the Senate to replace Obamacare — yet] If our hunch is right, and local media drew attention to what might be lost — which they could do even without changing the focus on winners and losers — then that would help explain why the ACA has grown more popular, and the AHCA less so, the more citizens learned what one did, and the other would not contain. Something similar may well have happened with Medicaid, which was featured rarely in the first round of stories about the ACA in 2013-2014, but which likely got much more attention once both the House and Senate proposed to cut it significantly. Once the Senate picked up the repeal legislation, a small group of senators drafted the bill behind closed doors — in what may have been an effort to quiet the news coverage that was prompting the public to pressure legislators. If the move was strategic, it largely worked. As you can see in the figure above, local television news rarely referred to Senate deliberations during this period — much as it rarely covered the bill while it was quiescent in the House, after Ryan pulled the first vote and Congress was in recess. When the Senate bill’s details were finally unveiled June 22, local TV newscasts started reporting on legislative developments, only taking a break from coverage on July 4. To put the difference in coverage into context, we have graphed the average number of weekday, evening newscasts with mentions in the month before and after the Senate bill was unveiled, as you can see below. As you can see, the number of local television newscasts mentioning health reform jumped dramatically after the Senate bill’s details were unveiled. That was even more true — with upward of five newscasts an evening containing mentions — in states represented by key Republican senators like Susan Collins of Maine, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia or Dean Heller of Nevada usually considered to be swing votes. That’s a lot of coverage for local newscasts that usually don’t focus much on national affairs. Of course, we do not know yet precisely how local TV covered the Republican repeal and replace effort. But a look at the drop in public approval of efforts to repeal the ACA suggests that local TV coverage cannot have made things easier for wary GOP senators. On the one hand, they face a public that largely disapproves of the proposed repeal; on the other, they made campaign promises that may come back to haunt their reelection chances. Whatever happens in the coming days or weeks, the ACA repeal debate will surely keep showing up prominently in news coverage. Journalists will be digesting the results. And then discussion of the ACA will return in yet another medium that matters: the political advertising campaigns leading up to the 2018 elections.

"McCain makes a fine speech, but what now?","Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) returned to the Senate to lecture his colleagues about returning to regular order, the necessity of compromise and the necessity of shutting up and tuning out the most bombastic voices. He told his colleagues: [Senate debates] are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time I remember. Our deliberations can still be important and useful, but I think we’d all agree they haven’t been overburdened by greatness lately. And right now they aren’t producing much for the American people. Both sides have let this happen. Let’s leave the history of who shot first to the historians. I suspect they’ll find we all conspired in our decline – either by deliberate actions or neglect. We’ve all played some role in it. Certainly I have. Sometimes, I’ve let my passion rule my reason. Sometimes, I made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh I said to a colleague. Sometimes, I wanted to win more for the sake of winning than to achieve a contested policy. He argued, “Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To hell with them. They don’t want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood.” Although he had voted to proceed on a strictly party-line vote on a nebulous bill he stated, “Let’s trust each other. Let’s return to regular order. We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That’s an approach that’s been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires.” He reiterated he’d be a no vote on the current health-care bill — further underscoring that Tuesday’s vote still leaves the GOP short of a majority for any particular bill. He admonished Republicans, ““We’ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it’s better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don’t think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn’t.” It was a powerful speech that surely would have packed more punch had he voted against a bill and a process that violated many of the principles he outlined. Denying his party the chance to debate was, however, a bridge too far. The vote allows Republicans to claim they didn’t vote to preserve Obamacare, but without committing them to a replacement. In other words, it was a means by which members could deflect blame but take no responsibility for their actions. We dearly hope McCain does cast many more votes, including one to bury this monstrosity. If he does, his chiding of his party’s Senate leadership will ring true. “What have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions? We’re not getting much done apart,” he advised. “I don’t think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn’t the most inspiring work. There’s greater satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent agreements that don’t require abandonment of core principles, agreements made in good faith that help improve lives and protect the American people.” The Senate is already a smaller place, a shadow of its former, august self. One shudders to think how much worse it will be without McCain.

Senate Republicans’ gross irresponsibility,"Of all the reckless and counterproductive stunts the Senate Republicans have pulled — including shutting down the government in 2013 — none is as glaring and destructive as their decision to vote without a single hearing on a bill dramatically reshaping health care and taking coverage away from tens of millions of people. And they don’t even know what they are voting on. I don’t mean they are confused as to what’s in the bill; that would be commonplace laziness. No, in this case less than 24 hours before voting the GOP had not decided what bill to vote on. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) was alternately incredulous and outraged. “We’ve been on the topic of health care for 7 months,” he said on the floor Monday. “Republicans have been talking about repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act for over 7 years. And yet, here we are, one or two days from a vote on the motion to proceed, and we don’t even know what Republican plan to vote on.” He continued, “We are potentially one or two days away from a vote on a bill that would reorganize one-sixth of the American economy, impacting tens of millions of American lives — and no one knows what it is! It’s sort of like ‘Alice in Wonderland’ around here. It’s come down to this bizarre game where the Republican leader has basically said, ‘let’s spin a wheel and see what we’re going to vote on.'” Actually the Republican confusion perfectly reflects their and the president’s mind-set — they really don’t care about health care, let alone improving health care. This is now a game of chicken, testing whether they are more afraid of being tagged as cruel (voting to repeal Obamacare with no viable replacement) or cowardly (refusing even to vote). A chasm a mile wide is opening inside the GOP. On one side stands the profane, irresponsible and ignorant president and his followers; on the other is a smattering of actual grown-ups. In the former category count Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-Tex.), who declared it “absolutely repugnant” that “some female senators from the Northeast” won’t vote to repeal. Apparently he thinks West Virginia (home to Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito) and Alaska (home to Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski are in the “Northeast.” (Republican Sen. Susan Collins from Maine does come from the Northeast so he was one for three.) He then cracked: “If it was a guy from south Texas, I might ask him to step outside and settle this Aaron Burr-style.” Oh, that’s a knee-slapper. Yes siree. That’s a Republican from the party of Trump. At the other end of the spectrum, Ohio Gov. John Kasich released a statement, which read in part: “The American people will come out on the losing end if Senate Republicans try to force through a new healthcare proposal with no bipartisanship, transparency or open dialogue. Until Congress can step back from political gamesmanship and come together with a workable, bipartisan plan, it is a mistake for the Senate to proceed with a vote on Tuesday and force a one-sided deal that the American people are clearly against.” He urged Congress to get back to a bipartisan approach. What Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) regards as a threat (talking to Democrats), Kasich knows is an essential element of legislating. Right now, the GOP is defined by reckless stunts and legislative incompetence. Rather than provide an ungrounded president with sane, legislative leadership, GOP lawmakers, just as we predicted, have adopted the worst aspects of President Trump’s outlook and personality. This is not a party fit to govern.

"If Mitch McConnell fails to repeal Obamacare, he should blame himself first","Few people in America rode into 2017 higher than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). After leading Republicans to the Senate majority in 2014 and blocking President Barack Obama from filling the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s Supreme Court seat, McConnell helped the GOP hold the Senate last fall to deliver the first unified Republican control of government in a decade. Just six months later, though, McConnell is staring at a dramatic reversal of fortunes, facing a full-blown rebellion among the Republican senators he leads and serious doubts about his leadership ability. But that shift is not as abrupt as it may seem, since McConnell sowed the seeds of the discord he now faces as he forged his path to power. If pride goeth before the fall, a healthy dose of hubris preceded McConnell’s setback. For a man who titled his memoir “The Long Game,” McConnell’s decision to dive into health care as the Senate’s first major order of business remains a head-scratcher. Health care comprises one-sixth of the U.S. economy and affects most Americans in some form or another. Democrats’ effort to pass the Affordable Care Act stretched from the spring of 2009, past Christmas and into early 2010, spanning dozens of hearings and countless hours of public debate. President Trump was pilloried for saying “nobody knew health care could be so complicated,” but McConnell made the same mistake. [‘Repeal-and-replace’ is probably doomed. Congress rarely works along party lines.] To be sure, Trump promised to repeal Obamacare quickly, and there are procedural reasons why repealing health care first would make the GOP’s next ambition, a major rewrite of the tax code, easier. But the Senate leader is not captive to the president’s campaign promises, and treating an issue of health care’s magnitude as a quick errand to be dispatched on the way to tax reform is pure hubris — the exact strain of Master of the Universe policymaking arrogance for which Republicans often criticize Democrats. Moreover, McConnell missed a major opportunity to build on Republicans’ electoral momentum and exacerbate Democrats’ divisions. If McConnell had started with a more reasonable goal with bipartisan potential, like boosting spending on infrastructure projects, he would have had a solid chance of picking off Democratic senators, logging an early achievement, wreaking havoc on Democrats and building a far more positive environment for themselves than the morass they currently face. Instead, Democratic leaders have used to recent fights to unify the rank and file and deepen their ties to the progressive resistance, while Republicans have careened into a state of open civil war, with Trump repeatedly bashing fellow Republicans on Twitter and even threatening Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) to his face, on national television. The Senate leader is supposed to keep his eye on the big picture. Even though the House moved quickly to pass its own repeal bill, McConnell was under no obligation to act if he thought it was not in the best interest of his conference. Every leader has their ups and downs, but part of what’s shocking — especially relatively early in this new administration — is that the Republicans who have broken from McConnell publicly are violating the cardinal rule of criticizing or opposing the leader, which is: no surprises. In the 2014 midterms, Republicans’ Senate campaign mantra was “Fire Harry Reid.” Many Democrats in red states felt compelled to criticize him to stake out their independence — but they did so by picking relatively benign issues like amendment strategy, and above all else he was never surprised. But not only did numerous Republicans reject McConnell’s pleas to “keep their powder dry” and refrain from publicly opposing the bill, at least one of the pivotal “no” votes blindsided the leader, with Sen. Mike Lee’s (Utah) office stating that he did not tell McConnell before he announced his opposition. The tone of his fellow Republicans’ criticism is severe, with his colleagues questioning his strategy, calling his honesty into question and accusing him of double-dealing. Republicans from across the spectrum have criticized McConnell’s strategy and the closed process, from Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) to Lee, with Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) calling for a return to “regular order” — an implicit jab at McConnell’s repeated promises not to run things this way if Republicans regained the majority. In the intimate confines of the Senate, the most critical asset a leader has is his word. In this close-knit environment, verbal commitments are the iron beams girding the legislative process. And no commitments mean more than those given by a leader. So it is striking to see a Republican senator like Ron Johnson (Wis.), not generally considered a gadfly, accuse McConnell of a “significant breach of trust” and tell a reporter that he sought out other Republicans to confirm that McConnell was telling different senators different things. The respect McConnell enjoys is based almost entirely on delivering political victories — but even here, he may have depleted his capital by delivering those victories at the expense of the Senate as an institution, ratcheting down the power of committees and individual senators. McConnell has taken a torch to the Senate’s role as a deliberative, thoughtful body in many ways over the years, from breaking all previous records on the number of filibusters waged to denying Judge Merrick Garland so much as a hearing to going nuclear at the drop of a hat to confirm Justice Neil M. Gorsuch (Reid went nuclear too, but only as a last resort after years spent trying to negotiate alternative solutions. McConnell pulled the trigger at the drop of a hat.) But his original sin was recasting the fundamentally centrist legislation that was Obamacare as a socialist government takeover, scorching the Earth that should have provided fertile ground for public debate. Whether it leans to the right or left, most centrist health reform policy looks substantially like Obamacare, which was based on the reform implemented by then-Gov. Mitt Romney in Massachusetts. But the rhetoric McConnell and his allies used against it left Republicans with no room to maneuver when it became their turn to craft health-care policy. For example, a good-faith effort like the legislation proposed by Collins and Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) earlier this year was considered a non-starter and did not factor into the repeal debate because it too closely resembled Obamacare. [Why Republicans are finding it so hard to come up with a replacement for Obamacare] McConnell’s centralization of power was also evident in the drafting process, where he bypassed all committees, failed to hold a single hearing and drafted the bill the Senate will vote on this week in his leadership suite with a handful of his own aides. For years, McConnell’s fellow Republicans were willing to tolerate, even embrace, McConnell’s tactics as long as McConnell delivered political victories and amassed political power. But now that Republicans have power, they’re facing the reality that the way McConnell amassed it has hamstrung their ability to get things done. One possible prism for refining your view of McConnell is the 2016 election — the crown jewel of his political victories. Held to a certain light, McConnell is a political genius who saw Trump’s ability to win when no one else did, and defied all predictions and laws of political physics. Held to another, McConnell woke up on Election Day expecting Trump to lose, and he became the beneficiary of the biggest windfall of political luck in modern times. The latter explanation aligns with the consensus on McConnell in Reid’s office when I worked there: that he is a master tactician but a poor strategist. And while you can spend hours turning the prism to this or that angle, a simple way to resolve the question may be to rely on McConnell’s own words from December: “I didn’t think President Trump had a chance.” Read more: This is what it’s like answering all those phone calls to Congress Republicans have long dreamed of cutting Medicaid.

Charlie Gard’s case is tragic. But it’s not a warning about public health care.,"The saga of Charlie Gard — the critically ill 11-month-old boy with a spectacularly rare genetic disorder, who is on life support in a London hospital — seems to be coming to a close. Charlie has been at the center of a highly politicized imbroglio with international reach as a result of a disagreement between his parents and physicians over his fate. On Monday, however, that appears to have ended, after his parents learned of the results of an MRI performed last week and decided it was “too late” for an experimental therapy that had been offered in the United States. This is, more than anything, an utterly heart-rending situation for Charlie’s family. Looking back at the controversy over his medical care from an American prospective, however, one is also struck by how Charlie was used politically in this nation: Right-wing politicians and commentators have wielded his tragic case as a crude cudgel against the public provision of health care, essentially accusing the British National Health Service of sentencing him to die. “I stand with Charlie Gard and his parents,” House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) posted on Facebook on July 13. “Health care should be between patients and doctors. Government has no place in the life or death business.” President Trump, meanwhile, offered to “help” the child via Twitter. On Rush Limbaugh’s show, Vice President Pence opined, “We hope and pray that little Charlie Gard gets every chance, but the American people oughta reflect on the fact that for all the talk on the left about single-payer, that’s where it takes us.” Just last week, the House Appropriations Committee moved unanimously on an amendment that would grant Charlie residency status in the United States to facilitate his transfer here to receive experimental treatment, as his parents were hoping (until Monday), but his doctors opposed. The latter felt that the evidence was scant that the therapy would do him any good and that continuing life support would just prolong his suffering. There’s a serious hypocrisy in the conservative rhetoric, as others have pointed out. After all, Republicans are simultaneously attempting to dismantle the health-care safety net, which helps ensure that people don’t die simply because they are poor. Perhaps Ryan’s talk about the “death business” was actually a form of projection. Regardless, Ryan didn’t frame the debate quite right in his Facebook post. Health care should be between physicians and patients, he said — but it was Charlie’s own doctors who were pushing for a palliative care-only approach. Ultimately, it wasn’t Ryan’s government bureaucrats, but rather Charlie’s health-care providers who decided that his condition was beyond treatment. (British courts agreed with them.) [Who gets to decide if Charlie Gard’s life is worth living?] Charlie had the terrible misfortune of inheriting a pair of genetic mutations that deplete his body of mitochondria, the minute structures that produce energy molecules that cells need to live. As a result, he has for months suffered — according to the hospital — “catastrophic and irreversible brain damage.” He cannot breathe, he essentially cannot move, and he cannot hear. He has been kept alive because of the miracle — and sometimes the curse — of life support. To be clear, there would have been no debate — and no controversy — whatsoever if Charlie’s physicians and parents had been in agreement: The physicians would have already proceeded to withdraw life support some time ago, and we would never have heard of the case. This happens in ICUs in the United States and Britain every day. In other words, this case was never about what many people thought it was about. It was not about “euthanasia.” It was not about “death panels.” It was not about the “value of life.” And although the case captivated “conservative groups from the United States led by Catholics and evangelicals,” it was not really about religion. In Catholic doctrine, for instance, it is permissible to cease life support when an individual is overcome with disease. “We may reject life-prolonging procedures that are insufficiently beneficial or excessively burdensome,” as medical directives from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops note. Finally, it was never about “socialized medicine.” The means by which a health-care system is funded neither creates nor resolves these difficult situations: They are instead the inevitable consequence of the mid-20th–century invention of the ICU and of life-support tools like ventilators. I would wager that most, if not nearly all, critical-care clinicians have found themselves in scenarios where they felt they were doing a true disservice to another human being — performing invasive procedures, maintaining life support, prolonging suffering — because they were compelled to push ahead by a sick patient’s family. I most certainly have. And therein lies the crux of the Charlie case: There was no consensus between family and physicians. His physicians have firmly and consistently held that his condition makes discontinuing life support — and instead providing only palliative care so he was as comfortable as he could be — the appropriate medical decision, and they have been supported in this by multiple court decisions. Charlie’s parents wanted life support continued to take him to the United States, where Columbia University neurologist Michio Hirano had initially offered to provide an experimental treatment (“nucleoside bypass therapy”) that had never been tried, as STAT notes, on someone with his particular genetic mutation. Though it’s now a moot point, the question lingers: Had Charlie’s doctors been wrong to prevent his transfer, and withhold the treatment, earlier? One cannot know from the sidelines, but it is worth noting that the April High Court judgment refers to Hirano, at least at that time, as “the only expert in this case who has been suggesting that there is any potential benefit in nucleoside therapy” and notes that the physician himself once said, “I can understand the opinion that he is so severely affected by encephalopathy [brain dysfunction] that any attempt at therapy would be futile. I agree that it is very unlikely that he will improve with that therapy.” More recently, Hirano testified with what sounded like odd precision that there might be an “11 percent to 56 percent chance of clinically meaningful improvement” in the strength of Charlie’s muscles. With claims about new evidence, the case went back to court, and the controversy became only more heated. The Great Ormond Street Hospital, where Charlie is being cared for, did, in fact, consider this therapy but ultimately determined “that the experimental treatment, which is not designed to be curative, would not improve Charlie’s quality of life” and could not “reverse the brain damage that has already occurred.” There is simply nothing to suggest that the hospital was motivated at any point by anything other than what it saw as Charlie’s best interest. This was never about cost-cutting or rationing; Charlie is simply not, as the headline of Washington Examiner put it, “a baby … condemned to death by socialized medicine.” He is a baby tragically condemned to death by a fatal illness, which would be true in any country. [Republicans have long dreamed of cutting Medicaid. Trumpcare might really do it.] Admittedly, the landscape of who gets to make the critical decisions about stopping life support is different in the United States compared with Britain. As bioethicist Michael Dauber wrote in STAT, in the United States, when doctors and “surrogate” decision-makers disagree on continuing life support, the wishes of the surrogates — in a case like Charlie’s, where the patient is both too young and too ill to make medical decisions, his parents — take precedence. In Britain, the matter can be resolved in courts (and a guardian is appointed to represent children). Charlie’s case essentially revolved around the proper balance of power between surrogates and physicians over medical decision-making. The British approach may strike many here as problematic: The core principle around which so many of our bioethics debates revolve is autonomy, which is to say the sovereignty of the individual over his or her own body, the right to be at the center of all medical decisions. Paradoxically, however, the principle of autonomy is often of limited applicability in critical care, as during a moment of an overwhelming illness, many people are unable to engage in the complex, necessary discussions (in Charlie’s case, he is obviously also too young). There is simply no ideal solution, contrary to Ross Douthat’s assertion in the New York Times that the situation is an “easy question, whose answer makes the case a moral travesty.” Some may be horrified at the notion of physicians making decisions “over” family members, but this happens frequently. For instance, if parents insist that their child not receive a lifesaving treatment for religious reasons, they can — and should — be ignored. Obviously, the Charlie case is different: There is nothing to suggest improper motivations on the behalf of his parents, and they were trying to provide, and not deprive him of, care, albeit of questionable utility. But look at it from the perspective of Charlie’s physicians, who have been receiving a torrent of death threats and abuse. Continuing life support — and sustaining his potential suffering — so that he could cross the Atlantic to obtain experimental therapy that they believed has no chance of curing him and little chance of significantly palliating him would have constituted a form of real harm. However we answer it, the question of how decisions about the cessation of life support are made is an issue that is separate from how we structure and fund our health-care system. Attempts to link universal health care with one particular approach to end-of-life decision-making are disingenuous and dangerous. Chalie’s doctors have wanted to withdraw life support from him for months because they believe that is the best way they can help him. Those who denounced them are today fighting fervently to withdraw health coverage from millions to make way for tax cuts for the rich. Which one is the real moral travesty?

Senate Republicans take cynicism to a horrifying new level,"We are hurtling toward a health-care disaster in the next 36 hours or so, for the worst possible reason. Cynicism is seldom completely absent from the operation of politics, but this is truly a unique situation. Republicans are set to remake one-sixth of the American economy, threaten the economic and health security of every one of us and deprive tens of millions of people of health-care coverage, all with a bill they haven’t seen, couldn’t explain and don’t even bother to defend on its merits. Why? Because they made a promise to their base and now they say they have to keep it — regardless of what form keeping the promise might take and how much misery it might cause. Tomorrow, the Senate is set to vote on a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. What Republican bill? The senators themselves don’t even know. Here’s how Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) described it yesterday on “Face the Nation“: It appears that we will have a vote on Tuesday. But we don’t whether we’re going to be voting on the House bill, the first version of the Senate bill, the second version of the Senate bill, a new version of the Senate bill, or a 2015 bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act now, and then said that somehow we will figure out a replacement over the next two years. I’ve often argued that Republicans in Congress aren’t serious about policy, but this is taking their unseriousness to the level of farce. After complaining for years that the ACA was “rammed through” Congress — in a process that involved a full year of debate, dozens of hearings in both houses and 188 Republican amendments to the bill debated and accepted — they’re going to vote on a sweeping bill that had zero hearings and that they saw only hours before, because who cares what’s in it? It’s only the fate of the country at stake. If taking away health-care coverage from 20 million or 30 million Americans is what it takes to stave off a primary challenge from some nutball tea partier, then that’s what they’ll do. No one would argue that keeping promises isn’t important. But Republicans have elevated the idea of keeping their promise to repeal the ACA to the point where it’s drained of all substance. You can see it in the way they talk about the various iterations of their bill. You seldom hear a Republican defend it on the terms of the bill itself. They don’t say, “Here’s how this bill will bring down deductibles” or “Here’s how the bill will take care of those who lose their insurance” or “Here’s how the bill will lower costs.” That’s partly because their bills won’t do any of those things, but mostly because they just don’t care. Instead, what they say is, “We made a promise, and we’re going to keep it.” If Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) handed them a bill saying that all children on Medicaid would be taken to the desert, buried up to their necks in the sand, and covered in fire ants, at least 40 of them would say, “It may not be perfect, but we have to keep the promise we made to repeal Obamacare, so I’m voting yes.” For those few Republican senators with a hint of conscience — or whose states are particularly reliant on the ACA, and on Medicaid in particular — McConnell is trying to hand them a fig leaf they can use to justify their votes. But the goodies he’s offering are laughable. Consider, for instance, that McConnell is telling senators that he’ll put in $200 billion to help states that didn’t expand Medicaid. Sounds generous, until you realize that’s on top of over $750 billion in Medicaid cuts. It’s like saying, “I’m stealing your car, but here, you can keep the spare tire.” The same is true of the $45 billion over a decade they’re tossing in to address the opioid crisis. Many of the states hardest hit by that crisis are ones such as Ohio and West Virginia that are most dependent on Medicaid. So for them, the Republican bill would take $15 or $20 away from the program most central to treating the addicts in their state, but toss a dollar back to make up for it. People who work with state budgets and addiction treatment have been telling anyone who’ll listen that given the magnitude of this crisis, $4.5 billion a year is a joke. But it might be enough to allow a couple of Republicans in the Senate to claim they aren’t making the problem dramatically worse, which is exactly what they’d be doing. What you’d expect of leaders is to say, “Okay, there are a bunch of interlocking, complex problems we want to solve here. This has to be done carefully. Let’s take our time and make sure we get it right.” But that’s not what Republicans are saying. Instead, they’re saying “We have to vote on a bill now, even if we don’t know what it’s in it and even if it makes the problems we claim to care about impossibly worse, so we can say that we repealed Obamacare.” Sure, it would be bad to kick 20 million or 30 million people off their coverage — but not as bad as having to admit they failed to pass a bill! This is even less serious and more cynical than what they’ve been doing for the past seven years. When they held dozens of votes in the House to repeal the ACA, it may have been silly, but at least it didn’t hurt anyone. Now they have the power to affect people’s lives by the millions — even destroy them — and they can’t be bothered to spend more than a day or two figuring out how to do it.

Are we heading toward a constitutional crisis?,"THE MORNING PLUM: The Post and the New York Times are both reporting on what appears to be a serious escalation in the Trump team’s intentions to constrain the investigation of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and The Post is also reporting that President Trump has privately been exploring the possibility of granting pardons to his family members, and perhaps even himself. Which means the possibility that we are sliding toward a constitutional crisis needs to be take seriously. Now what? In an interview with me this morning, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon — a hard-charging Democrat on the Intelligence Committee — sounded the alarm in a big way, suggesting it’s time for Democrats to begin serious outreach to Republicans in Congress about sending a united message to Trump: Any effort to remove Mueller is unacceptable and will be met with a forceful response. “What’s important, now, today, is finding a path to send the strongest possible message that firing Mueller without cause would be seen as an attack on democratic values and the rule of law and that there will be negative consequences,” Wyden told me. “What we’ve seen so far, when the president says these kinds of things, is that Republicans try to find ways to leap out of the line of discussion,” Wyden said, adding that he was going to step up his own efforts to ensure that Republicans “understand how ominous this is.” “I am going to be doing everything I can to get both sides of the aisle to send the strongest possible message,” Wyden continued. “It could include a letter; it could include a resolution; it could include things that other senators may think of.” The Post’s report says that Trump’s lawyers are exploring ways to undercut Mueller’s investigation, perhaps by arguing that he has conflicts of interest. The report also says that Trump has been “fuming” about Mueller’s probe and “has told aides he was especially disturbed after learning Mueller would be able to access several years of his tax returns.” It is a measure of where we are now that this last revelation is not at all surprising. Candidates in both parties have voluntarily released their tax returns for decades, in an effort to show transparency as a matter of obligation to the public. As I argued yesterday, Trump has demonstrated that he has zero conception of any such obligation. Trump’s private rage that such transparency may be forced upon him confirms this in an unsettling way — he plainly views himself as the victim here and is wallowing in a deep pit of grievance and megalomania. But that grievance and megalomania could shape his legal strategy. As one close adviser to the president put it: “If you’re looking at Russian collusion, the president’s tax returns would be outside that investigation.” Taken along with Trump’s comments to the New York Times, in which he said he would view any investigation of his family finances as a “violation,” it appears Trump is trying to set down lines that Mueller must not cross. Another Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, suggested today that this could be legally problematic, arguing that “trying to draw lines” or “put certain subjects off limits,” and then “intimidating or threatening a prosecutor” could verge “on potential obstruction of justice.” There is, of course, precedent for presidents on both sides going on the attack against their prosecutorial tormentors. But Trump reportedly mulled trying to remove Mueller until getting talked out of it by his staff. Indeed, one Republican told The Post that all of this is part of an effort at “laying the groundwork to fire” the special counsel. Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, claims talk of trying to remove Mueller is “nonsense.” But who thinks Trump can be counted upon to do what his lawyers say? Indeed, Trump’s own staffers have confided they aren’t sure whether he’ll try to do this at some point. Now, you might be forgiven for thinking that it’s unlikely that Republicans will act to send a forceful message to Trump that such a course of action is off limits. Yesterday, CNN’s Jake Tapper reported that he had talked to a number of GOP senators who are very critical of Trump’s comments to the Times, in which he suggested that he would not have selected Attorney General Jeff Sessions if he had known Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia probe. But most of them would voice their concerns only under cover of anonymity. Still, Wyden insists it is imperative that Democrats try to get Republicans to speak up. We must “send the strongest possible message to the president now, today, that there will be consequences,” Wyden says. * MOVES AGAINST MUELLER COULD PUT PRESSURE ON REPUBLICANS: NBC’s First Read crew pointedly comments: Every member of Congress should be on the record on this question: What will you do if Trump tries to fire Mueller or pardon his aides or family members? Indeed. Let’s get on that. * REPUBLICANS CAN’T DECIDE WHAT TO VOTE ON: The New York Times reports that GOP leaders have not decided which health bill — the most recent measure that restores some of the Affordable Care Act’s tax hikes; or full repeal — they are going to vote on next week: The choice is unpalatable: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Thursday that the latest version of the bill to repeal and replace the health law would increase the number of people without health insurance by 15 million next year and by 22 million in 2026 … On the other hand, if senators opted simply to repeal the existing law, the budget office said on Wednesday, 32 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 compared with current law. Or, alternatively, Republicans could vote on something other than rolling back the historic expansion of health coverage to tens of millions of people to finance a huge tax cut. Just a thought. * MAJORITY DISAGREES WITH RUSSIA MEETING: A new CNN poll finds that 57 percent of Americans say Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort should not have met with the Russian lawyer to get dirt from the Russian government. Interestingly, even 36 percent of Republicans say they shouldn’t have done this. Still, 55 percent of Republicans say they are not at all concerned about the meeting, and another 24 percent say they’re not too concerned, a total of 79 percent. So expect criticism of this stuff from GOP lawmakers to remain relatively muted. * TRUMP SHAKES UP LEGAL TEAM: CBS News’s Major Garrett tweeted last night that Marc Kasowitz has been removed as Trump’s lead private lawyer. The Times adds that Trump liked Kasowitz’s “blunt” style but that he wasn’t a good fit for the delicacy of Trump’s evolving legal concerns, and that “veteran” Washington lawyer John Dowd will be taking the lead. In other words, it’s gettin’ real. * FOR THE GOP CONGRESS, FAILURE EVERYWHERE: The Associated Press points out that not only is it likely that the GOP health bill will fail, but also it could get a lot worse: The GOP goal of overhauling the tax code requires passing a budget that is months overdue. That means success on the tax front is highly uncertain … Promised infrastructure legislation is nowhere … A government shutdown already looms as a possibility in the fall … Money for President Donald Trump’s border wall … looms as a major land mine. Then there’s the possibility of a market-shattering default if Congress fails to increase the nation’s borrowing authority. Surely Trump’s renowned dealmaking prowess will save Republicans from themselves. Or perhaps his mighty Twitter feed will do the trick? * TRUMP HARMING MILLIONS OUT OF SPITE: Paul Krugman lists the ways that the administration is sabotaging the ACA, including threatening to cut off “cost -sharing subsidies” to lower-income people, which could drive out insurers and leave millions without coverage: The truly amazing thing about these sabotage efforts is that they don’t serve any obvious purpose. They won’t save money — in fact, cutting off those subsidies, in particular, would probably end up costing taxpayers more money than keeping them. They’re unlikely to revive Trumpcare’s political prospects … It’s basically about spite: Trump and his allies may have suffered a humiliating political defeat, but at least they can make millions of other people suffer. As I noted the other day, congressional Republicans could put an end to this madness immediately, if they chose to. * HOW TO STOP TRUMP’S SABOTAGE: Politico points out that there are other ways that the administration’s sabotage of the exchanges could be put in check: One possible brake on the administration might be the pushback from some Republican governors and lawmakers who oppose letting insurance markets crumble on their watch — even as Trump insists voters will blame Democrats … “The best next step is for both parties to come together and do what we can all agree on: fix our unstable insurance markets,” wrote 11 governors this week in a bipartisan letter led by John Kasich of Ohio and John Hickenlooper of Colorado. Should the GOP bill fail, this will be the next big battle. * AND TRUMP IS SHATTERING POLLING RECORDS: Gallup finds that Trump’s second-quarter approval average of 38.8 percent is lower than any other president’s in the history of presidential polling. And that’s not all: Trump has set new record lows for job approval ratings early in presidential terms, including his initial 45% reading, his first-quarter average of 41.3%, and his second-quarter average of 38.8%. Six months into his presidency, he has yet to register a single job approval rating above 50%, averaging 40% job approval to date. For the purposes of the midterm elections, one key number is Gallup’s finding that his average second-quarter approval average among independents is an abysmal 36 percent. So much winning!

"The Health 202: Republicans can run from health care debate, but they can't hide","THE PROGNOSIS Marketplace guide Jim Prim works on the Healthcare.gov federal insurance website (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) As much as Republicans might like to move past the toxicity of Washington's health-care debate for a bit, they just can’t – not with big, outstanding questions about Obamacare’s future still staring them in the face. Senate Republicans will still cast some form of health-care vote next week, GOP leadership says, although we're not exactly sure on what. The aim could still be to bring to the floor a bill replacing big parts of the Affordable Care Act. Or, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) might substitute in a bill repealing the law. Either way, the vote is expected to fail the way things stand right now. Too many conservatives and moderates are still too uncomfortable with the whole thing. But if and when McConnell's attempt fails, that doesn't mean Republicans are rid of their health-care problems. Enrollment in the state-based marketplaces – where about 11 million Americans buy insurance – starts in just three months, and hundreds of counties will have just one or no plan options under present conditions. They'll be looking at the first full sign-up season with Republicans holding both the White House and Congress, putting them under heavy pressure to ensure Americans have insurance options – or otherwise bear the blame if they don’t. Then there’s the question of who will actually sign up. How Republicans approach enforcing the individual mandate and funding extra cost-sharing subsidies will have significant influence on the resiliency of the marketplaces – that is, who enrolls and whether insurers are able to start breaking even. Right after enrollment season ends, there's another ACA element that will be implemented under the law -- a tax on health insurers is set to start up again in January after Congress suspended it for 2017. Bombarded by opposition from the insurance industry, which argues the tax will force it to hike premiums, it’s up to Republicans to either delay the levy again, repeal it or let it take effect. President Trump speaks about the Senate health-care bill during a lunch on Tuesday. (AFP PHOTO / SAUL LOEBSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images) Regardless of President Trump's insistence that he won't be blamed for problems with a system he is charged with implementing, polling suggests otherwise. Sixty-one percent of respondents to an April Kaiser Family Foundation poll said Republicans are responsible for any ACA problems going forward compared to 31 percent who said such issues would still be Democrats' fault. The bottom line is this: Ignoring health care after the party’s embarrassing meltdown on an Obamacare replacement isn’t an option for the GOP. Here’s a quick run-down of their decision list: 1. Whether to fund cost-sharing subsidies Depending on how a  court case plays out, congressional Republicans will likely have to decide whether marketplace insurers will continue receiving an extra bucket of payments to cover cost-sharing discounts they’re required to give the lowest-income enrollees. Called cost-sharing reductions, or CSR’s, these payments represent about 18 percent of the total subsidy payments marketplace insurers get from the federal government in order to lower costs for poorer Americans. The problem is that while the premium subsidies are funded by the ACA, the CSRs require an appropriation from Congress, a federal judge has ruled. The Trump administration has been making the payments month-to-month for now, but if the ruling stands, Congress would have to shell out. The CSR’s are a hefty chunk of change, so if insurers don’t get certainty about the payments, more are likely to withdraw from the marketplaces next year and beyond, worsening the situation for millions of Americans shopping there. “I think everyone involved in this -- state regulators and insurers and consumer groups and provider groups – agree they need to do something about the cost-sharing reduction payments,” Tim Jost, a health law professor at Washington and Lee University, told me. “That’s the single threat by far to the individual market.” And the marketplace situation is already tenuous in parts of the country. Unless more insurers join last-minute (they have until Sept. 27 to submit final plans to the feds), 40 counties will have no plan options and some 1,300 counties will have only one option in 2018, according to data released Wednesday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 2. Whether to enforce the individual mandate Insurers have warned Congress that healthy people must have incentives to buy coverage if the marketplace are going to work as intended. The IRS still accepted tax returns this year that failed to indicate whether a person had health coverage – but it hasn’t indicated whether it will crack down for next year. How strictly the federal government enforces the mandate and other rules around when people can enroll all plays into the overall environment of the marketplaces and insurers’ calculations. Several major insurers have already withdrawn entirely, and more are warning they’ll exit too if the marketplaces don’t eventually become self-sustaining. “Clarity around the rule set,” Cigna CEO David Cordani told me in an interview last week, when asked what his company is seeking from policy-makers. Cigna sold plans in seven states this year, but hasn’t yet announced its plans for 2018. Cordani said that encompasses a range of policies – from the individual mandate to CSR's to how enrollment will be handled. “The marketplace is a basket of rules and a basket of standards and a basket of approaches,” Cordani said. “How that basket gets refreshed, changed or solidified is what’s most important.” 3. Whether to repeal – or keep – Obamacare’s sales tax on insurance plans Dubbed the “HIT” by the insurance industry, plans are arguing that the tax will force them to hike premiums and undermine the overall goal of bringing down health-care costs. America’s Health Insurance Plans cites a study by Oliver Wyman that found the tax would cause employers to pay $210 more per employee and families to pay $530 more per year on average. This argument has gained traction with Democrats and Republicans alike, who agreed to suspend the tax for one year in a budget bill they passed at the end of 2015. Insurers are pressing for Congress to either suspend the tax again or repeal it entirely. They paid $11.3 billion in 2016, but that’s expected to be 26 percent higher – around $14.3 billion – next year. If Republicans allow the tax to go into effect under their watch, they could suffer industry backlash. UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s campus in Minnetonka, Minn.

John McCain (R-Ariz.) speaks on Capitol Hill. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) AHH: Sen. John McCain used his signature snark yesterday to warn colleagues that he will be returning soon to Washington — and chastised the Trump administration for ending assistance to moderate Syrian rebels battling the government of Bashar al-Assad. The Arizona Republican has been diagnosed with a brain tumor called a glioblastoma, and underwent surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye last week -- prompting McConnell to postpone a previously planned health-care vote. I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support - unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by! Yesterday, McConnell said, “We look forward to seeing our friend again soon and we hope he’ll be back in the very near future.” When McCain might return to Washington"
Teachers union leader bashes Betsy DeVos — and DeVos strikes back,"There’s no more pretending to play nice between Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. In April, the two visited a traditional public school in Ohio together in what was a short-lived experiment in “getting to know you,” and they were supposed to visit a charter school together, too. But on Thursday, Weingarten gave a blistering speech at her union’s convention in Washington, calling DeVos an “ideologue who wants to destabilize and privatize the public schools that millions of Americans value and rely upon.” A few hours later, DeVos went after the teachers unions — and the AFT, in particular — in a speech she gave in Denver to the American Legislative Executive Council, a powerful conservative organization of lobbyists and state legislators. DeVos accused the unions of being  “defenders of the status quo” who care only about “school systems” and not about individual children. She mentioned — and had displayed — an AFT tweet criticizing her for saying that public money should be invested in individual students and arguing instead that “we should invest in a system of great public schools for all kids.” DeVos said: “I couldn’t believe it when I read it, but you have to admire their candor. They’ve made it clear that they care more about a system, one created in the 1800s, than they do about individual students.” [Betsy DeVos claims philosophy of Margaret ‘Iron Lady’ Thatcher as her own] President Trump and DeVos have made clear that their chief educational priority is to expand school choice, including privately run charter schools, voucher and similar programs that use public money to pay for private and religious school education. They both have criticized the traditional public school system, America’s most important civic institution, which educates the vast majority of the country’s schoolchildren. Weingarten said in her speech that defenders of America’s public education system are in a “David versus Goliath battle, and in this battle, we are all David.” While the unions contribute a good deal of money to candidates and causes they support, she was setting up union members as the “Davids” against ultra-wealthy philanthropists, including DeVos, a Michigan billionaire, who have been financially supporting efforts to expand school choice and privatize the public education system. Weingarten said that the term “choice” was, decades ago, “used to cloak overt racism by segregationist politicians like Harry Byrd, who launched the massive opposition to the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision.” She said: After the Brown decision, many school districts, especially in the South, resisted integration. In Virginia, white officials in Prince Edward County closed every public school in the district rather than have white and black children go to school together. They opened private schools where only white parents could choose to send their children. And they did it using public money. Weingarten acknowledged that some public schools do not live up to the promise of providing a good education to every child: We get that public schools are not perfect and that every one doesn’t always work for every one of its students. We know that schools in America have always been unequal, often based on race and class. But I’ve never heard a parent say, “That school doesn’t work for my kid. So I want to engage in an ideologically driven market-based experiment that commodifies education and has been proven to be ineffective.” No, most of the time parents want a neighborhood public school that works for their child. They want their child to feel safe. They want their school to have adequate resources and small enough class sizes. They want their school to have music, art and science. They want their child to soar in challenging classes and get support when they struggle. They want their child to fill the dinner table conversation with stories about what they did in school that day. Earlier this month, the president of the country’s largest labor union, Lily Eskelsen García of the National Education Association, told delegates at her organization’s annual gathering that they would not work with the Trump administration because the president and DeVos could not be trusted to do what is in the best interests of children. She also labeled DeVos “the queen of for-profit privatization of public education.” [Teachers union leader: We won’t work with Trump and DeVos because ‘I do not trust their motives’] The two major teachers unions, which together represent several million people, have been quick to oppose the Trump administration. It took a lot longer for them to take issue with the Obama administration’s education reform policies, but both eventually did, calling for the ouster of Arne Duncan, who was education secretary for seven years under President Barack Obama. Here’s Weingarten’s speech Thursday as prepared for delivery and provided by the AFT: Introduction — My Day with Betsy Welcome to TEACH! I know many of you have just arrived in Washington (and you can understand why we call it the swamp), but let me start by taking you on a trip, to a town in Ohio called Van Wert. Like many rural areas in America, Van Wert has grown increasingly Republican. And in the November 2016 election, it went overwhelmingly Republican. Does that mean that the people of Van Wert agree with everything Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are trying to do, like end public schools as we know them in favor of vouchers and privatization and making education a commodity? Not in the least. The people of Van Wert are proud of their public schools. They’ve invested in pre-K and project-based learning. They have a nationally recognized robotics team and a community school program that helps at-risk kids graduate. Ninety-six percent of students in the district graduate from high school. This community understands that Title I is not simply a budget line but a lifeline. Why I am telling you about this town? Because these are the schools I wanted Betsy DeVos to see — public schools in the heart of the heart of America. Unfortunately, just like climate change deniers deny the facts, Betsy DeVos is a public school denier, denying the good in our public schools and their foundational place in our democracy. Her record back in Michigan, and now in Washington, makes it clear that she is the most anti-public education secretary of education ever. Betsy DeVos called public schools a “dead end.” Our public schools aren’t a dead end. They’re places of endless opportunity. They’re where 90 percent of America’s parents send their children. And while Secretary DeVos may have thought Van Wert would be a good photo op, my goal, like any educator, was to teach her something. And we did: Great things are happening in our public schools. And with the right support, they can do even better. That’s what she saw in Van Wert, and that’s what’s happening in public schools across the country. Betsy DeVos cannot claim ignorance of what’s happening in public schools — only indifference. But how can you be indifferent when you hear from someone like Claudia? I remember Claudia’s history class — the great discussions and the lively debates. But I also remember some grousing that I was pushing the class too hard. (Claudia, I didn’t push you nearly as hard as you pushed yourself.) And I could not be more proud that my former student is a member of AFT Local 243 in Madison, Wis. Everyone in this hall has their Claudias. It’s why we do what we do. And it’s why we are going to hold Betsy DeVos accountable for her indifference, and for her attacks on our profession and on public education. But her attacks are not the only challenges we face. She’s not the only ideologue who wants to destabilize and privatize the public schools that millions of Americans value and rely upon. Let me be blunt: We are in a David versus Goliath battle. And in this battle, we are all David. How Did We Get Here? So how did we get here? It didn’t just happen last Election Day or Inauguration Day. The moment we’re in is the result of an intentional, decades-long campaign to protect the economic and political power of the few against the rights of the many. It has taken the form of division — expressing itself as racism, sexism, classism, xenophobia and homophobia. And its intentions are often disguised. For example, take the word “choice.” You hear it all the time these days. School “choice.” Betsy DeVos uses it in practically every sentence. You could show her, as I did, an award-winning robotics program, and she’d say “What about choice?” which she actually said. You could probably say “Good morning, Betsy,” and she’d say, “That’s my choice.” She must love restaurant buffets. But let me be really serious. Decades ago, the term “choice” was used to cloak overt racism by segregationist politicians like Harry Byrd, who launched the massive opposition to the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision. After the Brown decision, many school districts, especially in the South, resisted integration. In Virginia, white officials in Prince Edward County closed every public school in the district rather than have white and black children go to school together. They opened private schools where only white parents could choose to send their children. And they did it using public money. By 1963, African American students had been locked out of Prince Edward County public schools for five years. AFT members sent funds and school supplies. And some traveled from New York and Philadelphia to set up schools for African American students in church basements and public parks, so these students could have an education. And what about the schools Betsy DeVos appallingly called “pioneers of school choice” — historically black colleges and universities? HBCUs actually arose from the discriminatory practices that denied black students access to higher education. HBCUs are vital institutions, but that doesn’t change the truth of their origins: They were born of a shameful lack of educational choices for African American students. Make no mistake: The “real pioneers” of private school choice were the white politicians who resisted school integration. But neither facts nor history seems to matter to this administration. In March, DeVos gave a speech here in Washington. She justified “choice” by saying: “I’m simply in favor of giving parents more and better options to find an environment that will set their child up for success.” Who could disagree with that? It’s not ideological to want a school that works for your kid. It’s human. But her preferred choices — vouchers, tuition tax credits, and private, for-profit charter schools — don’t work. And, after decades of experiments with voucher programs, the research is clear: They fail most of the children they purportedly are intended to benefit. The Department of Education’s own analysis of the D.C. voucher program found it has a negative effect on student achievement. The Louisiana voucher program has led to large declines in kids’ reading and math scores. Students in Ohio’s voucher program did worse than children in its traditional public schools. And I could go on and on about for-profit and online charters, as well. And, while parents are promised greater choice, when a family uses a voucher for a child to attend a private school, in reality it is the school — not the family — that makes the choice. That’s because private schools can — and many do — discriminate, because they don’t follow federal civil rights laws. Vouchers increase racial and economic segregation. And they lack the accountability that public schools have. Many voucher programs, like the one here in Washington, D.C., don’t even reveal how much public funding they receive or how students are performing. DeVos defends this lack of transparency, saying the important thing is not quality or accountability, but — what? Choice. These choices do not increase student achievement. They do not reduce inequity or segregation. They drain funds from and destabilize our public schools. And they move us further away from the choice every child in America deserves — a well-supported, effective public school near their home. But Trump and DeVos are not backing off their support for vouchers, for-profit charters and other privatization schemes. They have proposed a $250 million “down payment” they want to follow with billions of public dollars for vouchers and tuition tax credits. And you know how they plan to pay for it? By cutting federal education spending that goes directly to educate children in public schools by $9 billion. Make no mistake: This use of privatization, coupled with disinvestment are only slightly more polite cousins of segregation. We are in the same fight, against the same forces that are keeping the same children from getting the public education they need and deserve. And what better way to pave the path to privatize education than to starve public schools to the breaking point, then criticize their shortcomings, and let the market handle the rest. All in the name of choice. That’s how a democracy comes apart. On the 60th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision, I was in Topkea, Kansas, the home of the plaintiffs in the Brown case. I was there to support the fight against Gov. Sam Brownback’s draconian disinvestment from public education. The big idea behind the governor’s “real-live experiment” with trickle-down economics was that cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations, and slashing public services, would somehow lead to an economic boom. There was no boom — only devastating cuts to public schools and other services, and a bust for the state’s economy. This spring the Kansas Supreme Court found that the people who’d suffered the most were black, Hispanic and poor students. We fought this vile experiment. And last month even the Republican-controlled Kansas state Legislature forced Gov. Brownback to increase public education funding by nearly $500 million. We took a stand in Prince Edward County. And we took a stand in Kansas. Both fights were long and hard. We didn’t give up, and we didn’t do it alone, with one tweet, one speech or one demonstration. How Do We Move Forward? Five Values (Five Smooth Stones) Yes, it’s exhausting. We have to fight harder and harder just to keep from losing ground. But I haven’t lost heart or faith, because, although we face formidable adversaries, we are David to their Goliath. When leaders controlling the federal government are hell-bent on taking away health care from 32 million people in order to give a tax cut to the ultra-wealthy, we are David to their Goliath. When officials far from the classroom care a whole lot about testing and test scores, but don’t give a damn about what our students really need, we are David to their Goliath. When hedge funders, billionaires and anti-labor ideologues band together in an axis of inequality, further rigging our political and economic system against working folks, we are David to their Goliath. When a presidential administration takes actions that make immigrant students afraid to dream, that favor fraudulent for-profit colleges over students seeking an education, that put an entire religion in its crosshairs, we are David to their Goliath. When governors in state after state go after labor rights and voting rights, and they find an ally in the newest Supreme Court justice who will hear the Janus case, we must be David to their Goliath. Years ago, I had the opportunity to visit the Valley of Elah, where the standoff between David and Goliath took place. And if you remember Sunday school, you’ll recall: That wasn’t a fair fight, either. Goliath was big; David was a little guy. Goliath had an army. And David? David had a sling — with five smooth stones. But David had a plan. Goliath no doubt assumed his greater strength was enough, but we all know how that ended up. I like the fact that, in our sling, we also have five smooth stones. Five values that we are translating into action. What are they? I am on the road more often than not, or at least it feels that way. And I get to talk with a lot of people. Here’s what I’ve seen and heard: No matter where people are from, or their political persuasion, there is a common set of aspirations — for themselves and their families. When we connect on values — these values, these five stones — we win. We help make people’s lives better, and we repair the common ground that has been jackhammered apart. Four Pillars Well, David had his five stones, but he only needed one. And while I could talk at length about each of these five core values, I want to focus on one: powerful, purposeful public education. Great things are happening in public schools in every community in America, and we need to lift them up. Poetry slams. Socratic seminars. Science fairs. Speech therapy. Students checkmating their chess coach. A once-struggling student reading on grade level. Any one of you could talk about things going on in your classroom and your school that you’re proud of — and I hope you will! In New York City, the United Federation of Teachers (my home local) started what they call #PublicSchoolProud — you saw it in the video. This campaign is now taking hold in Florida, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas. It’s one of the ways school employees, parents and communities are showing that there is so much to be proud of in our public schools. We get that public schools are not perfect and that every one doesn’t always work for every one of its students. We know that schools in America have always been unequal, often based on race and class. But I’ve never heard a parent say, “That school doesn’t work for my kid. So I want to engage in an ideologically driven market-based experiment that commodifies education and has been proven to be ineffective.” No, most of the time parents want a neighborhood public school that works for their child. They want their child to feel safe. They want their school to have adequate resources and small enough class sizes. They want their school to have music, art and science. They want their child to soar in challenging classes and get support when they struggle. They want their child to fill the dinner table conversation with stories about what they did in school that day. Our public schools are filled with dedicated professionals who are doing their level best — despite never having enough funding, despite the relentless attacks, despite misguided policies gussied up as “reforms” and despite the challenges children bring from home. And with some key investments and the right strategies, we’ll not just have the will, we’ll have the way. So as far as I’m concerned, the only choice is: Do we as a nation strengthen and improve our public schools, or don’t we? Children’s well-being means meeting children where they are — emotionally, socially, physically and academically; making sure they feel safe and valued. Since half of the kids in public schools are poor, that also requires confronting the reality of poverty. One way is to coordinate the services kids need in community schools. The AFT Innovation Fund is helping our affiliates open and expand community schools. What about powerful learning? Public schools are asked to develop students academically and personally. That doesn’t happen by testing and test prep. It happens when learning engages students and encourages them to investigate, strategize and collaborate. It’s why we fight fiercely for art and music and project-based learning like the computer animation career-tech program the AFT Innovation Fund is supporting in Miami. And what about developing our capacity as educators? How many times in your career have you been thrown the keys and told to just do it? No one would tolerate that for pilots or doctors or our armed forces. But educators? Please … We continue to fight against the infantilization of teachers and the “teachers should be seen and not heard” sentiment of people who make decisions affecting teaching and learning, but who haven’t spent 10 minutes in a classroom. That’s the purpose of the AFT Teacher Leaders Program, which now counts 800 participants. Thousands of members have participated in AFT professional development. And hundreds of thousands more have developed their skills through Share My Lesson and the professional development offered by our state and local affiliates. The glue that holds all this together is collaboration: school employees, parents and community partners working together. When schools struggle, the response too often is top-down takeovers and firing staff. Those approaches are “disruptive”all right — another term public school deniers love — but they are not effective. Just look at McDowell County, W.Va., the eighth-poorest county in the United States, where coal used to be king. The state took over the school district for a decade. Nothing changed. But now, after an AFT-led partnership that utilizes these four pillars, graduation rates are up by double digits. Most importantly, we are helping change children’s lives. These four pillars won’t be built on hopes and wishes, they’ll be built on learning effective strategies — which you’re doing here at TEACH — and on investment. Investment is crucial. But Trump and DeVos, and many states, are actually going in the opposite direction. They tell the lie that public schools are failing, and they try to make huge budget cuts to make the lie real. The Trump-DeVos budget zeros out resources for reducing class size and for teacher professional development, and strips all funding for community schools, and after-school and summer programs. So offerings like the summer learning program at D.C.’s Brightwood Education Campus, which I visited this week, would be gone, along with its Springboard program, a summer literacy course for students in kindergarten to second grade. This program not only prevents summer learning loss, but in the five weeks of classes, has increased students’ literacy levels by 3½ months. In essence, the Trump-DeVos budget takes a meat cleaver to public education. And it’s not just the education cuts. While Trumpcare might be on hold right now, the battle is far from over. Its $880 billion cut from Medicaid was inhumane. And it would mean, for the almost 80 percent of school districts that rely on these funds, the loss of school nurses and health screenings, wheelchairs and feeding tubes, for our most vulnerable kids. And for what? A tax cut for the wealthiest Americans? These cuts rob children of opportunity. That’s why we fight them, with actions like the lobbying and rallying many of you did yesterday. And people are with us. The AFT recently commissioned a poll. Three-quarters of the people we talked to oppose the deep cuts to education that Trump and DeVos are proposing. And just as many oppose taking away funding from public schools to increase funding for private school vouchers and charter schools. RESIST — AND RECLAIM While people have always supported public education, what makes this moment different is that now, millions of Americans are hungry to fight for something better. But with the daily outrages and the relentless assaults on our values and our democracy, it can be hard to know where to begin. Well, it begins with elections. They have consequences — big-time. Voting really matters. But what can we do between elections? That’s where one of the books I’ve become obsessed with helps. It’s by Yale history professor Timothy Snyder. It’s called “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century.” And you got a copy in your conference bag. Snyder’s 20 lessons are told through the lens of history. They sharpen our understanding of what is going on around us. And these lessons are important because most of today’s students were born after Nazi genocide, after apartheid, after the Berlin Wall fell, and after de jure segregation in the United States had been outlawed. They could have, as Snyder writes, the “sense that history could move in only one direction: toward liberal democracy.” Tragically, that’s just not true. Snyder writes, “History does not repeat, but it does instruct. … History can familiarize, and it can warn.” He reminds us that we can’t take our institutions for granted. That dictators throughout history have built power by kneecapping trade unions and co-opting or undercutting public education. Believe in truth. Listen for dangerous words. Contribute to good causes. Be a patriot. Defend institutions, such as unions. There is something that each of us can do to defend democracy and fight tyranny. And if the next generation is to take up the fight, who better to teach them than America’s educators? So I am asking you: Let’s take our responsibility to resist injustice full on. And let’s take our responsibility to reclaim the future full on. Classroom by classroom. Community by community. And we are not alone. Take a look. This is a photo of the inauguration last January.  And this is from the Women’s March just one day after — and so is this, and this, and this. No, we are not alone.  Yes, those millions — yes, millions — of people who have protested since Election Day are, as the kids say, woke. They are energized — energized to fight against bigotry and hate, to fight for an economy that works for everyone and an America that leads the world. Why do we teach our students about Dr. King’s letter from Birmingham jail? Or Cesar Chavez’s organizing of immigrant workers, or Mahatma Gandhi’s fasts, or Malala’s ordeal? Because we know that nothing is more inspiring than when people whom the powerful want to keep down, rise up. And we, too, will rise. To rise takes more than a moment, or even a hundred moments. It takes a movement. And you are part of that movement. So: By resisting, and reclaiming the promise of public education for all of our students, we will preserve our democracy. We will protect our most vulnerable. We will strengthen our communities. We will take on Goliath. And we will win. "
GOP blows it with women — again,"From right-wing talk show hosts has come venom. From liberal defenders of the Affordable Healthcare Act has come admiration and praise. We’re talking about three GOP female lawmakers — Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia — who were instrumental in sinking Trumpcare. A Slate staffer wrote, “Anyone currently hosting a dance party on the grave of the Senate’s disastrous health care bill can thank Republican women for the freshly-packed soil. After Republican men failed to come up with a health care proposal their own party could abide, a desperate Sen. Mitch McConnell tried on Tuesday to simply repeal Obamacare as a half-measure that might help the legislators save face. Three Republican women—Sens. Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito, and Lisa Murkowski—refused to go along, derailing the plan.” Meanwhile, talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, whose insults toward women are a hallmark, charged, “The Republican caucus in the Senate is infected with essentially leftist members. … These three female leftists in the Republican caucus are running the Senate, not Mitch McConnell.” In case you missed that: These three liberal women who call themselves Republicans are running the Senate. Yeah, who is wearing the pants around there!? Several points deserve mention. First, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and other male lawmakers have also come out to oppose the bill so it’s not — eye-roll, harrumph — just those women who are the flies in the ointment. Nevertheless, as many male colleagues held back, these three women were willing to stick their necks out to defend their constituents and explain that the bill is an abomination from a health-care perspective. They may be more moderate than many male colleagues but it is hard to dispute that they are also braver. Regardless of the gender of the objecting senators, Democrats will have a field day reigniting the “war on women” theme as they go after the GOP lawmakers who supported a monstrous bill that disproportionately hits women in certain respect. Much has been made of the attempt to de-fund Planned Parenthood in the context of abortion politics, but the issue goes well beyond abortion. Women’s health advocates point to the Texas example where pro-life advocates’ efforts wound up increasing the number of abortions. (“The state abortion statistics for 2014, recently released by the Department of State Health Services, show new evidence that the family planning funding cuts in 2011 made it difficult for low-income women to prevent unplanned pregnancies. In fact, the county-level data show dramatic increases in abortions and demonstrate a connection between cuts to family planning, reductions in contraceptive services and unintended pregnancy.”) As for Medicaid cuts, the Kaiser Family Foundation found: Medicaid, the nation’s health coverage program for poor and low-income people, provided more than 25 million low-income women with health and long-term care coverage in 2014. Women comprise the majority of adult Medicaid beneficiaries—before the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and today. The program provides beneficiaries with a wide range of primary, preventive, specialty, and long-term care services important to women across their lifespans. Federal policymakers and Congress are debating a replacement plan for the ACA that could fundamentally reshape Medicaid and reduce federal Medicaid spending. Given the critical lifeline that the program provides for low-income women and their families, changes to the program financing and structure could have significant implications for low-income women’s access to coverage and care. … Nationally, Medicaid is the largest financier of publicly funded family planning services, accounting for 75% of all public expenditures. … Medicaid is the largest single payer of pregnancy-related services, financing 48% of all U.S. births in 2010. In five states and DC, Medicaid covers more than 60% of all births. Those are some daunting statistics. And one has to imagine that support for the repeal only or for repeal-and-replace-but-keep-huge-Medicaid-cuts will be a loser for lawmakers, especially those such as Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who ran a smart campaign to defuse the “war on women” charge by championing available contraception. Listen, all by himself Trump is a giant turnoff for women voters. His popularity is low in part because his support among women is rock bottom. Ron Brownstein observed: The Election Day surveys found that men preferred Republican candidates for Congress by a 12-point margin, 55 percent to 43 percent. Women preferred Democratic congressional candidates by 10 points, 54 percent to 44 percent. In each case, that preference tracked closely with their vote in the presidential contest, where men gave Trump a 13-point edge and women preferred Clinton by 11 points. In the new survey, the GOP congressional advantage has narrowed among men to a 4-point margin—an 8-point decline in the party’s lead since last fall’s vote. But Democrats recorded a gain more than twice that large among women in the survey. Compared with Democratic congressional candidates’ 10-point edge with female voters last November, the survey showed women now prefer a Democratic Congress by fully 28 percentage points, 59 percent to 31 percent. The Trumpcare episode seems tailor-made to aggravate that problem. Republicans championed bills that are rotten for many Americans but women in particular. When women senators who had been excluded from the secret meetings among 13 senators stepped forward to halt the legislative debacle and raise a variety of concerns (most especially giant cuts in Medicaid), right-wingers ridiculed them. Democrats would be silly not to make this a major issue in 2018. If Republicans had a modicum of common sense, they would put these three senators and others with concerns about fixing the Obamacare exchanges and keeping Medicaid intact on a committee to work with Democrats. Will they? Don’t hold your breath.

CBO again confirms the cruelty of GOP’s ‘repeal-only’ plan,"No matter what version of the Republican health-care scheme it examines, the Congressional Budget Office reiterates the conclusion of Trumpcare’s critics: These proposals are not about expanding affordable health-care insurance. The GOP is conducting an exercise aimed to deliver tax cuts for the rich funded by brutal Medicaid cuts as it tries to undo the federal government guarantee of health-care coverage that the Affordable Care Act created for able-bodied, non-elderly adults. Unfortunately, Republicans are not honest enough to say what they are after, and for good reason. Giving huge tax cuts to the very rich, slashing Medicaid and renouncing the idea that health-care insurance is a “right” turn out to be really, really unpopular. Just as it did when the Republicans first proposed a “repeal-only” plan, the CBO finds that the current proposal would increase the number of uninsured by more than 30 million over the next decade. (“The number of people who are uninsured would increase by 17 million in 2018, compared with the number under current law. That number would increase to 27 million in 2020, after the elimination of the ACA’s expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and the elimination of subsidies for insurance purchased through the marketplaces established by the ACA, and then to 32 million in 2026.”) The GOP bill repeals the subsidies but not the required components of health-care insurance coverage. As a result, coverage would quickly become unaffordable for most every American individual health-care market. “Average premiums in the nongroup market (for individual policies purchased through the marketplaces or directly from insurers) would increase by roughly 25 percent—relative to projections under current law—in 2018. The increase would reach about 50 percent in 2020, and premiums would about double by 2026.” Wow, what’s not to love? This bill, the hard-right Republicans insist, must pass to preserve their seven-year-old promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. A steep increase in premium costs is the response to complaints about steep increases in premium costs. One can only imagine the ads that will run against lawmakers who would vote for such a bill. The mystery is not why Republican senators would refuse to vote for this monstrosity but how any Republican can, with a straight face, say he or she is improving health care in the United States by voting for this. As we said when “repeal only” was first introduced, the bill would immediately wreck the exchanges, and the health-care system they would bring about would be far worse than under Obamacare and pre-Obamacare coverage. Vituperative commentators and activists on the right are spitting mad that Republicans cannot get their act together to make good on their promise. They lambaste their fellow Republicans for lack of nerve and for inconsistency. What they do not do much of, if at all, is defend the particular bill on the merits, by the standards the GOP set for itself. The party became convinced that Obamacare was “unworkable,” citing rising premiums and higher deductibles. If Obamacare is unworkable, what is the party’s own work product? There is something clarifying about the GOP’s return to a repeal-only bill (although who knows whether Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is so rattled by this debacle as to force a vote that would fail and nevertheless haunt Republicans for years to come). It does confirm that the GOP’s anti-government venom — not the particulars of Obamacare or its replacement — is what motivates the Trumpkin/right-wing alliance. At least we can dispense with the pretense that these Republicans want to help Americans by getting rid of Obamacare.

Voters tell GOP to knock it off: No Obamacare repeal,"On practically an hourly basis, President Trump changes his mind on how to approach health care — but then again he may not understand he is sending contradictory directions. Let Obamacare fail! No, don’t leave town until this is done! Just repeal and delay. No, wait, we need a replacement. If not already convinced Trump is too unstable to handle the duties of chief executive, watching him spin round and round in the wind might convince you. Unfortunately neither he nor congressional Republicans seem to be paying attention to the public. An overwhelming percentage want Congress to work together on a bipartisan basis to fix the Affordable Care Act. There is a reason Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) so frequently takes to the floor to declare things such as: “I sincerely hope that my Republican friends here in Congress reject the premise of the president to let our health-care system collapse and hurt millions. Instead, I hope they work with us, in the areas I mentioned and many others, to do what’s right for the American people.” It’s a very popular position. How popular? The Associated Press reports: Americans overwhelmingly want lawmakers of both parties to work out health care changes, with only 13 percent supporting Republican moves to repeal “Obamacare” absent a replacement, according to a new poll. . . . In the poll, 8 in 10 said Republicans should approach Democrats with an offer to negotiate if the current GOP overhaul effort fails, rather than sticking with their own “repeal and replace” campaign of the past seven years. And nearly 9 in 10 said Democrats should take Republicans up on such an offer. While elected Republicans still fixate on immediate, complete repeal of Obamacare the public has moved on: “Among Democrats, only 22 percent actually want the ACA kept just as it is; 64 percent want it kept but with changes. Among Republicans, 27 percent want immediate repeal, while 54 percent favor repealing the law when a replacement is ready.” Republicans who think they can back the federal government out from guaranteeing health care should perk up: In the poll, 62 percent said it is a federal responsibility to make sure that all Americans have health care coverage, a 10-point increase from just a few months ago. Thirty-seven percent said health care for all is not a federal responsibility, down from 47 percent in March. “When confronted with millions losing coverage, Americans are more supportive of the principle that the federal government should cover people,” said Robert Blendon of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who reviewed the AP-NORC findings. Indeed, 59 percent said they preferred leaving “Obamacare” in place over its outright repeal. The AP results mirror other polls. The consensus among voters is clear. Poll after poll shows voters like Obamacare more than Trumpcare. They want to fix Obamacare. They don’t want to slash Medicaid. They want protections for people with preexisting conditions. In short, Republicans continue to charge up the hill without popular support — only to be rebuffed again and again. Republicans are in disarray and denial. The White House is frenetic and unhelpful both in settling on a strategy and defining the terms of a deal. The GOP right-wing base and Trumpkin media machine have decided to excoriate the GOP for refusing to make a deal voters don’t want. (Go figure.) This will not end well for the GOP.

A wounded Trump lashes out over the Russia probe,"President Trump has always been the most effective, dangerous witness against himself in the burgeoning Russia scandal. He told NBC’s Lester Holt that when he fired former FBI director James B. Comey, he had the Russia scandal in mind. He then seemed to threaten Comey, hinting there might be tapes of one of their conversations. In a New York Times interview, Trump on Wednesday once again put out incriminating information, potentially setting himself up for serious consequences, be they political or legal. He declared, “[Attorney General Jeff] Sessions should never have recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself he should have told me so I could have picked someone else.” In a single run-on sentence, he humiliated Sessions, conveyed that he had intended to use Sessions to insulate himself from the Russia mess and reinforced the perception that he sees the Justice Department as his personal legal firm, not a department whose independence must be respected. (He also whined that he did not like Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein overseeing the investigation because there are very few Republicans from Baltimore. Did he not know whom he had nominated for the deputy attorney general position?) Whether Sessions chooses to remain in a position for which the president now regrets nominating him remains an open question, but without the president’s confidence in the attorney general, the Justice Department becomes a diminished force. Sessions may love playing “cops and robbers,” but so long as he remains, the Justice Department lacks a champion in the Cabinet who has sway with the president. [Trump’s deeply worrisome New York Times interview reveals a lawless president] Trump’s frustration over Sessions’s refusal to violate ethical standards stands out as further evidence that for Trump, loyalty is everything. Ethical and legal boundaries do not register with him; indeed, his loyal underlings are expected to disregard such niceties to protect him. Nothing better underscores his unfitness for office. He did, after all, take an oath to faithfully execute the laws, not to use government lawyers to shield him from inquiry. That concept is foreign to Trump, who sees the FBI and Justice Department as his supplicants. “In an environment in which the President of the United States, in a single interview, expresses no-confidence in the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, the special counsel, the acting FBI director, and the special counsel’s staff, and in which he makes clear that the FBI should be his personal force and that all of law enforcement should be about serving him, the [principal] protection is having people with backbone who are willing to do their jobs and stand up for one another in the elevation of their oaths of office over political survival,” writes Benjamin Wittes. No wonder Trump felt compelled to go after Comey and then special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Trump warned that Mueller would cross a red line if he strayed into investigation of Trump’s finances apart from Russia. If that is where the investigation leads, would Trump fire Mueller? That seemed to be the implication, although he did not say so directly. (This comes in the context of a Times report that Deutsche Bank will cooperate with Mueller’s requests for information on Trump’s finances; the bank reportedly has lent Trump and his family millions over the years.) Again, Trump openly plays the intimidation game, unaware or untroubled by the potential that this will be seen as part of a scheme of obstruction and interference in an ongoing investigation. [Jeff Sessions and others: Don’t quit!] Trump’s gnawing obsession and anger with the Russia investigation, which he has called a witch hunt, certainly were on full display. Trump bemoaned Sessions’s recusal as “unfair,” accused Comey of lying about their conversations (and trying to use the dossier as leverage against Trump!) and attacked Mueller for conflicts of interest. His fury carried the whiff of desperation, if not panic. As he is wont to do, Trump repeatedly contradicted prior statements. After Comey testified, Trump’s team claimed the president was “vindicated”; now he says Comey’s account was full of lies. So which is it? Trump is flailing, throwing mud in every direction in the vain hope that his words will disable his critics. However, his undisguised fury with investigators only gives weight to the accusation that he tried his best to stop — obstruct, that is — an investigation into his team’s web of connections to Russia. Perhaps most interesting, Trump insisted, contrary to other witnesses’ accounts, that he spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin privately at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg for only 15 minutes. (Surely, others who were at the event can be asked about the length of the conversation). He also noted that the topic of Russian adoptions — the same pretext given for the Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and assorted Russians in June 2016 — came up. One suspects that this might be the approved segue into discussions of Russian demands with Trump family members. (Yesterday, the administration announced that it was cutting off support for Syrian rebels, just the move that Russia has long sought.) Trump’s presidency is sinking into the quicksand of the Russia investigation. The more he decries his tormentors, the more support he provides for their investigation. Who can doubt that he was determined to stop the Russia investigation? In lashing out at prosecutors, he commits new acts of intimidation, vainly hoping to curtail their inquiry. [No, President Trump, Sessions’s recusal is not ‘very unfair’ to you. This is Ethics 101.] The entire fiasco (in addition to Trumpcare’s failure) is devouring the presidency. Trump — not Sessions, Comey, Mueller or Rosenstein — is solely to blame for his predicament. His grave mistake was thinking that he could avoid scrutiny, just as he has done for decades in a privately held, family business. So, how is “Made in America Week” going?

"Police seek person of interest after break-in, ‘threatening note’ at GOP senator’s office","Police on Wednesday released new video as they sought to identify a person of interest after a break-in over the weekend at the Las Vegas office of Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican who was considered a critical swing vote on the GOP health-care bill. The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department described the man as a bearded, heavyset white adult between 50 and 60 years old. Surveillance-camera footage showed the man wearing a black baseball cap, a grey short-sleeve collared shirt, shorts and sunglasses, wandering inside what appears to be an office building. Police urged those who may have information about the break-in or who could identify the man in the video to call 702-385-5555 or to visit the Crime Stoppers website. On Saturday morning, officers had responded to a call about a burglary alarm at Heller’s office in southwest Las Vegas. There, they discovered what they described in a statement as a “threatening note” addressed to Heller (R-Nev.) near the door to his office. The Nevada Independent’s Jon Ralston reported Monday that the threatening note left at Heller’s office was related to the Senate’s upcoming vote on the GOP’s health-care bill: A note taped to Sen. Dean Heller’s campaign office was from someone asserting that he would lose his health care if the key senator voted for the repeal bill and that he would die if that happened and would take Heller with him, a law enforcement source said. Police said Monday that they would not disclose the contents of the note, citing the ongoing investigation. Megan Taylor, a spokeswoman for Heller, confirmed the break-in but said that she could not comment further, because of the investigation. Attempts to pass the GOP health-care bill collapsed earlier this week after Senate Republicans failed to garner the 50 votes needed. President Trump has demanded that senators remain in Washington to resurrect a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. At a lunch with Republican senators Wednesday, Trump and Heller were seated next to each other. As The Post’s David Nakamura reported, the president suggested that he might help unseat any Republicans who did not go along with his health-care agenda. “He wants to remain a senator, doesn’t he?” Trump said with a laugh of Heller, who also chuckled. “And I think the people of your state, which I know very well, I think they’re going to appreciate what you hopefully will do.’’ Trump added: “Any senator voting against starting debate is telling the American people you’re fine with Obamacare.” But the current health-care law, approved in 2010, has “failed,” Trump declared. “It’s gone.” Yet Trump’s remarks were sharply at odds with the comments from Senate GOP leaders over the past day who have said the reality is that there is not enough support for a replacement plan. Heller had been under pressure from the left and the right over his vote on the health-care bill. Republican lawmakers have been steadfast for years in their promise to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, former president Barack Obama’s signature health-care measure — a pledge Trump frequently invoked on the campaign trail. However, as The Washington Post’s David Weigel pointed out, Heller is the only Senate Republican facing reelection in 2018 in a state won by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last year. His unique position made him the focus of several advertising campaigns trying to lobby for his vote. Last month, Heller came out against an earlier iteration of the GOP’s health-care bill, becoming the fifth Republican senator to do so at the time. At a June 23 news conference, Heller said he was particularly concerned about potential cuts to Medicaid, as well as the impending loss of insurance for those struggling with mental-health and substance-abuse issues. “I’m telling you right now, I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes away insurance from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,” Heller said then.  The incident at Heller’s office follows similar incidents involving other GOP senators in recent weeks. Over the Fourth of July recess, a protester was arrested outside the Tucson office of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) after allegedly asking a staffer: “You know how liberals are going to solve the Republican problem? They are going to get better aim.” And an Omaha man was arrested this month after walking into an Iowa motorcycle shop and allegedly saying that he “could kill” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who was scheduled to visit the shop the next day. The break-in also came just three days after the Federal Election Commission ruled that House and Senate lawmakers may now use campaign funds to pay for security upgrades at their personal homes — a change from previous rulings that required lawmakers to petition the panel on a case-by-case basis. But after warnings from House and Senate security officials in the wake of the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), the FEC said that security upgrades now qualify as “ordinary and necessary expenses” lawmakers incur as part of official duties. Ed O’Keefe contributed to this report.

Let’s debate. "
Trump is threatening to harm millions out of pure spite. Here’s what to watch for now.,"THE MORNING PLUM: Now that the Senate GOP health-care bill has collapsed, the chatter in Washington is all about whether Republicans and Democrats will — or even can — come together behind some kind of bipartisan deal to shore up the individual markets. Central to this question is the fact that President Trump is now threatening to sabotage those markets himself. He appeared to renew this with an early-morning tweet that was odder than usual, if you can believe that: The Republicans never discuss how good their healthcare bill is, & it will get even better at lunchtime.The Dems scream death as OCare dies! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2017  Senate Republicans are set to meet with Trump today to discuss what’s next, and Trump’s tweet appears to build on his vow yesterday to “let Obamacare fail” to force Democrats “to come to us” eager to support a compromise on his terms. This tweet helpfully illuminates his emotional grasp of the situation, which is drenched in grievance and spite. Letting Obamacare “die” will punish Democrats (they will “scream death”) for the collapse of his bill. Remember, he has raged at Democrats for not being willing to work with him as he tries to destroy Obamacare, apparently unaware of how absurd this stance is. Now he will make them “scream death.” But how seriously should we take this threat? Very seriously, until we have proof that he doesn’t really mean it, or until Republicans take active steps to defuse it, which they can do if they choose to. Trump can indeed do a great deal of damage. He can “let Obamacare fail” by refusing to renew the so-called cost-sharing reductions (a full explanation of the CSRs is here), which are paid to insurers to subsidize out-of-pocket costs to millions of lower-income people. If he did this, insurers would probably have to hike premiums by enormous amounts, and many might exit the markets, further destabilizing them, potentially causing many millions to have no access to coverage. We know Trump sees this threat as working in his favor: Back in April, he explicitly threatened not to continue the payments for the express purpose of forcing Dems to negotiate with him. The administration didn’t go through with it, and the payments have continued, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be ended this time. An insurance industry official told me today that insurance companies have gotten no indications from the administration that these payments will not happen this month. This official also told me that the industry would probably have received an indication if they were going to cease. So that may well mean this threat turns out to be empty. For now, anyway. The next big thing to watch is what happens in late August. That is when lawyers for the administration and the House of Representatives are due to reappear in court as part of the ongoing litigation around the CSRs. The House previously sued the Obama administration to block the payment of the subsidies, arguing that they are unconstitutional if they are not appropriated. President Barack Obama fought this, and the current administration now has to decide whether to continue to defend the CSRs against the House lawsuit. If it decides not to, and if it decides to stop the payments, the damage could be severe. We will know a lot more next month. As it is, the uncertainty around the payments has already done a good deal of damage. The American Academy of Actuaries recently noted that this uncertainty has already led insurers to price in the possibility of them disappearing as they set their premiums, and some insurers have openly blamed the Trump administration for their own premium hikes. At the same time, administration officials have dishonestly and reprehensively cited the partial results of their own sabotage — destabilized markets harming people — to make the case for the GOP health bill. Trump’s tweet today suggests he may continue with this, only with a different goal: Getting Democrats to “scream death.” As it happens, congressional Republicans, if they chose, could put a stop to any such strategy by appropriating the money to cover the CSRs themselves, as the insurance industry has urged. At this point, there is no serious argument against doing this: Some Republicans have said it must happen, perhaps in part because they are mindful that they would likely be blamed for any serious chaos in the marketplaces that would result. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said that if the GOP health-care bill failed, Republicans would have to negotiate with Democrats over ways to stabilize the markets. And as Jonathan Cohn explains, there actually is room for bipartisan talks around an array of reforms that could give Republicans, and even Trump himself, some of what they want, in both substantive and political terms: Polls also show the public strongly supports bipartisan action ― and if Trump were to sign a bill, flanked by Democratic and Republican lawmakers, he’d get the kind of signing ceremony he so obviously craves. He’d even look like he was governing. But first Trump would have to give up on the idea that if he “lets Obamacare fail,” he will be able to grind down Democrats to the point where they will “scream death” and give him everything he wants. It’s an absurd idea to begin with — polls have suggested the public will hold Trump and Republicans responsible for further Affordable Care Act problems on their watch, so Trump doesn’t have the leverage he thinks he does. But the key point is that Trump believes it is within his power to do this. * DEMS TAKE BIG LEAD IN GENERIC BALLOT MATCH-UP: A new Post/ABC News poll finds that Democrats now lead in the generic congressional ballot match-up by 14 points, 52-38. But there’s this caveat: Republicans actually hold the advantage in enthusiasm at this early point in the campaign cycle. A 65 percent majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents say they are certain they will vote next year, versus 57 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. Recent midterm elections have shown a big drop-off in Democratic voting. You’d think the Trump presidency would help change that, but … * TRUMP WAS ‘BORED’ BY HEALTH-CARE BILL FIGHT: The New York Times has a deep dive into why Trumpcare failed, which includes this nugget: The Senate bill … was ultimately defeated by deep divisions within the party, a lack of a viable health care alternative and a president who, one staff member said, was growing bored in selling the bill and often undermined the best-laid plans of his aides with a quip or a tweet. The real shock there is the notion that he “grew” bored. Was there ever a time when the specifics interested him in the least? * HOUSE DEM TRIES AUDACIOUS MOVE ON RUSSIA PROBE: CNN reports that Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts is issuing a challenge to his GOP colleagues on the Russia probe: Moulton plans to offer an amendment that puts the House on record supporting Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe and committing that it will provide any resources it needs for the team of lawyers at the Justice Department. The proposal would be attached to the House GOP crafted budget resolution. The House Dems’ campaign arm also formally asked their GOP counterparts to show a united front against Russian sabotage of the 2018 elections, with no luck. * TRUMP’S VOTE SUPPRESSION COMMISSION MEETS TODAY: The president’s commission on “election integrity” is set to meet for the first time, and The Post’s curtain-raiser doesn’t inspire confidence: [The commission] includes the publisher of “Alien Invasion II,” a report on undocumented immigrants who mysteriously showed up on the voter rolls in Virginia … Another championed some of the strictest voter identification laws in the country during her days in the Indiana legislature. And yet another warned nearly a decade ago of the “possibility for voter fraud on a scale never seen before in this country.” Let’s not forget that one reason this commission exists is to validate Trump’s lie that he would have won the popular vote if not for millions of illegal votes. * REPUBLICANS ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THE RUSSIAN THREAT: The Atlantic talked to a lot of congressional Republicans to see whether there is any point at which they might break with Trump. The answers are not encouraging: On one point, at least, there seems to be widespread consensus: All of them believe they’re already doing everything they can within reason to hold the president accountable — and they fiercely reject any argument to the contrary. One senior GOP aide, for example, described the outrage over Russia’s election meddling … as “a lot of partisan noise” generated by opportunistic Democrats. “Is there a cybersecurity issue here that needs to be taken more seriously? Absolutely. But,” he added with a scoff, “democracy is not dying in darkness.” The phrase “within reason” is doing a lot of work here. Why aren’t more Republicans calling on the Trump administration to do more about Russian meddling in 2018? * A LESSON IN WASHINGTON CHICANERY: Glenn Kessler notes that Trump and the White House have been claiming that under their bill, Medicaid spending would go up. But that’s actually a standard D.C. trick: Defenders of the law tried to claim that Medicaid spending could to go up over that 10-year period, just at a slower rate of growth. That’s because the raw dollars would increase from $393 billion in 2017 to $464 billion in 2026. But that claim ignores that CBO estimated that, with the lower funding, 15 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid. By 2026, funding for Medicaid would be $160 billion lower than under current law. But Trump is an outsider who’s bringing a fresh businessman’s eye to governing! He’d never resort to typically sordid tactics used by swamp-dwelling politicians, would he? * AND AN OHIO FATHER IS DEPORTED: ABC News has the emotional story of an Ohio father of four who never had a criminal record and worked at a packaging plant who has been deported. Note this, from former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief John Sandweg: “Cases like this are an incredible waste of ICE resources that only make it harder for the agency to identify and remove dangerous criminals… the [Trump] administration’s focus on the low-hanging fruit of the enforcement system only allows the bad guys to remain at large, weakening our public safety.” Beyond the humanitarian argument, this is a matter of resource allocation. Is this really a good use of limited enforcement resources?

"The spectacular failure of Trumpcare, Trump and McConnell","Gosh, if only Republicans had the nerve to take health-care coverage away from millions of Americans! That seems to be the bizarre reaction of Republicans disappointed that the GOP Senate is not willing to go back to the pre-Obamacare world, return nearly a trillion dollars in tax cuts to the super-rich and destroy Medicaid as a viable safety net (but don’t worry, that last part was just pretend!). The right-wing critics whine that Republicans are prisoners of the status quo. Well, if the alternative is something worse than the status quo, senators should plead guilty. If there is anything less politically astute than GOP members of Congress, it is those egging them on from the peanut gallery who think that the promise for seven years was “repeal but not replace.” The goal was not to make as many people as possible lose health-care coverage or to reinstitute barriers to coverage for the hard-to-insure. It was to replace Obamacare with something better. Now, Republicans surely were dreaming if they imagine that there was a magic formula to provide all the benefits of Obamacare with none of the costs or defects; but if they could not find a mutually acceptable alternative, then they did the responsible thing in first refusing to do no (more) harm. At least President Trump’s base isn’t bemoaning the evisceration of Medicaid, the loss of protections for those with preexisting conditions and the slashing of subsidies for the individual exchanges. Whatever right-wing purists were selling, the country — including Trump’s base — has never wanted to buy. The latest NBC-Wall Street Journal poll finds that “12 percent of Americans living in the counties that fueled Donald Trump’s win in the 2016 presidential election support the Republican Party’s efforts on health care.” Twelve. Right-wing radio talk-show hosts, TV pundits and think-tank gurus who have never run for office, held office or been responsible for the results of their white papers might consider that they have badly misunderstood the concerns of Americans, including those who voted for Trump and cannot be discounted as part of the “fake news” conspiracy. The GOP is now in a state of intellectual and political disarray, the result of a president who lacked the understanding to lead a major legislative effort and of congressional leaders who thought they could push something, no matter how faulty, through the House and Senate simply by shaming members who had previously demanded Obamacare’s repeal. The Post’s Dan Balz summed up matters: The president’s embrace of the Republican promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was and is incompatible with political views he often stated as a candidate. He adopted the rhetoric of repeal and replace, but whenever he talked about health-care policy, he did not sound like a conservative Republican. He wanted coverage for everyone. He didn’t want to hurt people. He didn’t want to make cuts to entitlement programs, whether Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. What Trump espoused clashed with what conservative, small-government Republicans long had been preaching. In office, his ambivalence has been evident at virtually every turn in the debate. He complained about the House bill as too mean after publicly praising it. He wanted repeal and replace without any pain. He wanted a victory but could not engineer it. The only hint of good news for the country and for the GOP’s redemption: Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said in a statement that his panel would hold hearings to explore “how to stabilize the individual market” under the existing law. A bipartisan group of 11 governors — including Republicans Charlie Baker (Mass.), Larry Hogan (Md.), John Kasich (Ohio), Brian Sandoval (Nev.) and Phil Scott (Vt.) — said they “stand ready to work with lawmakers in an open, bipartisan way to provide better insurance for all Americans.” . . . Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), one of the few in the chamber who has tried to be a bipartisan broker on health care, was placing calls to fellow senators who, like him, are former governors — a total of 11 senators including Alexander, John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Angus King (I-Maine), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Margaret Wood Hassan (D-N.H.). Aides said Manchin was presenting nothing specific yet to his colleagues, just a plea to “sit down and start bipartisan talking.” That’d be a refreshing change — almost akin to responsible legislating. I cannot imagine that this will go down well with the right-wingers who still pine to slash Medicaid and remove protections for those with preexisting conditions. The president pouts that he would prefer to let Obamacare fail — and, I suppose, to let people lose health-care coverage. Just as he failed to anticipate the public reaction to repeal-and-replace, Trump deludes himself if he thinks that the party in power can avoid responsibility for a health-care-system meltdown on its watch. In the meantime, Republicans have lost six months on cringe-worthy legislative wheel-spinning. It remains to be seen whether the gang that cannot shoot straight can successfully navigate a debt ceiling increase, a budget deadline and/or tax reform.

Morning Bits,"The GOP was an easy mark for Russian espionage artists. “How did the party of Ronald Reagan’s moral clarity morph into that of Donald Trump’s moral vacuity? Russia’s intelligence operatives are among the world’s best. I believe they made a keen study of the American political scene and realized that, during the Obama years, the conservative movement had become ripe for manipulation. Long gone was its principled opposition to the ‘evil empire.’ What was left was an intellectually and morally desiccated carcass populated by con artists, opportunists, entertainers and grifters operating massively profitable book publishers, radio empires, websites, and a TV network whose stock-in-trade are not ideas but resentments.” Read the whole thing. The implosion of support for a repeal-only health-care bill marks a low point for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): “McConnell has struggled for weeks to reach consensus on the elements of healthcare legislation. He has repeatedly huddled with both moderate and conservative senators in his office to try to craft a deal that everyone in his conference could live with.Republicans had hoped a new version of the bill released last week could reach the floor, but those hopes were dashed Monday night when it became clear a procedural vote would not succeed. McConnell on Tuesday pleaded with his members to continue working toward a healthcare vote.” This marks a new, ominous turn. “An accused Russian money launderer representing a Kremlin-friendly oligarch has been reportedly identified as the eighth person at a meeting with Donald Trump Jr. last June.” Could this mark the beginning of the end for Donald Trump Jr. and the rest of Team Trump? “Special counsel Robert Mueller has contacted an eighth attendee at a meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr. between top campaign aides and a Russian lawyer, in the first public sign that Mr. Mueller’s probe will include the gathering last June at Trump Tower in New York.” This, um, seems to miss the mark. “Trump Blames Democrats for Failure of GOP Health Bill: ‘We Had No Democrat Support.’ ” This would mark a real improvement. “The implosion of Senate Republicans’ Obamacare repeal push could clear space for a bipartisan deal on long-stalled sanctions against Russia to make it to President Donald Trump’s desk as soon as this month, a key GOP chairman said Tuesday.” Well, #NeverTrump Republicans hit the mark when they predicted that this would be the result. “In exchange for supporting Trump and turning a blind eye to his controversial behavior, the GOP hoped to reap the benefits of a negotiator in the Oval Office who could help them get things done while they controlled the presidency and both chambers of Congress. Instead, they got a highly inconsistent partner with a fleeting set of priorities and apparently very little interest in policy details.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The Daily 202: Teflon Trump gets blamed less by base for Obamacare fail than Senate GOP,"Donald Trump prepares to swing a Marucci bat, from Baton Rouge, during a Made in America” product showcase at the White House on Monday. (Alex Brandon/AP) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: President Trump has a funny way of talking about Republicans as if he’s not one of them"
Why can’t the Senate repeal Obamacare? Because its policies are actually popular.,"After seven years of promising to repeal Obamacare, Republicans expected that taking control of the two elected branches of government would make reaching that goal simple. With their latest stumble in doing so, we can draw two important lessons. First, judging policy packages by their partisan wrappers rather than their actual parts can be a mistake. Second, the design of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 shares many similarities with its predecessors: the 1935 Social Security Act, the 1965 creation of Medicare and Medicaid, and the 2004 Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit expansion. All of these major pieces of social legislation at first faced skepticism or even opposition — and then became ingrained in American life. Let’s examine these lessons here. [Here are the 4 reasons McConnell still couldn’t get the Senate to replace Obamacare — yet] Judge legislation not by its party but by its parts According to polls, more than half of Americans opposed the ACA. Then the 2016 election did what Barack Obama failed to do: increase public support for the ACA. With that election, public support for the ACA broke the 50 percent support barrier in the Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll. Since then, the ACA has consistently had majority support among those who offer an opinion. That’s because many of its key provisions are remarkably popular, and the prospect of losing them has revealed the ACA’s public support. The ACA, like several of its predecessors, is built to last It is only now clearer than it was before the election that most of the ACA has attained the status of an entitlement program — with provisions that significantly, though far from fully, work. And it is much harder to get rid of entitlements once they exist. In similar pieces of legislation, the general public has needed some time before appreciating the package. Skillful politicians long have understood this and have designed policies accordingly. For instance, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt established Social Security in 1935, his goal was to ensure income security for retirees for years to come. To get there, he designed a way to give most Americans the feeling that it was theirs, broadly spreading both the taxes and the resulting benefits. As he explained: “We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions … their unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my Social Security program….” Americans may have supported Social Security at first because they paid for it and felt entitled to it. But as more people began receiving benefits, they began to understand the more profound shift: Social Security lowered the distressing levels of poverty among the elderly. Some income security in retirement, however imperfect, came to be seen as a citizen’s right. [This explains why the Republicans struggle over Obamacare] In 1965, Americans similarly embraced Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. This time President Lyndon B. Johnson did not have to resort to Medicare payroll taxes — although that would come later — to get support for the program. The benefits would be spread broadly across most Americans — and that alone was powerful enough to build political support over time. After his landslide victory in 1964, Johnson and his coalition overcame long-standing ideological opposition and public unease toward anything that could be dubbed “socialized medicine.” With Obama gone, the public is seeing the provisions over the politics Similarly, now that “Obamacare’s” not universally popular namesake is out of office, the ACA is being seen for its provisions — that is, for what it has accomplished — rather than simply through the lens of partisanship. Large majorities like nearly all of the law’s major provisions, and now they prefer the ACA over any current alternative. The November 2016 Kaiser survey numbers on this were stunning. For instance, fully 90 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans supported allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26; 89 percent of Democrats and 77 percent of Republicans approved the elimination of out-of-pocket expenses for many preventive services; 91 percent and 67 percent wanted subsidies for low- and middle-income Americans to purchase insurance; 90 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Republicans support the Medicaid expansion; 75 percent and 63 percent wanted to prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage because of one’s medical history; and 82 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of Republicans support increasing the Medicare payroll tax on earnings for upper-income Americans. This consensus had two important exceptions: Republicans and independents opposed both the individual mandate that everyone have health insurance, and also the business mandate that employers with 50 or more employees offer insurance. President Trump and the Republicans apparently thought that the public’s opposition to these mandates was enough to do in Obamacare. They have found that they were wrong. The repeal tide is going out It may still take a while for the GOP leadership to look over its shoulder to see that most of the public is no longer siding with repeal. The July 2017 Kaiser poll numbers drive this home: Fully 71 percent of the public (91 percent of Democrats, 72 percent of independents, and even 41 percent of Republicans) want Republicans to work with Democrats to improve the ACA. Only 23 percent want to repeal and replace it. This may not matter for the majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate who want it repealed or for those House members who worry about a primary challenge from their right. But apparently it matters to enough Republicans, including governors, who realize that they will have to confront these opinions in their next general elections and beyond. Many of the ACA’s provisions have become part of the fabric of our health-care delivery and financing systems and have reshaped the preferences of the American public — now and for the longer term.

Here are the 4 reasons McConnell couldn’t get the Senate to replace Obamacare — yet,"With the news today that Senate Republicans are likely to give up their quest to repeal and/or replace Obamacare, we are re-posting our analysis, originally published on June 28. Despite GOP efforts to revamp their plan, the underlying dynamics and conference cleavage we identified last month remain the same. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday postponed a procedural vote to call up a GOP plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. After a seven-year GOP campaign and House passage of a bill earlier in the spring, why hasn’t the Senate delivered? McConnell may yet fashion a deal, but the delay suggests an uphill battle. Here’s why. 1. Senate Republicans are a deeply divided conference with a slim majority. The figure below shows the broad historical sweep of the party’s ideological diversity (as measured by the party’s standard deviation in Common-Space Nominate scores) arrayed against its size. Today’s Republican Senate is less ideologically fractured than it was in the late 1970s. But ideological disagreement has been on the rise for over a decade. With such a slim majority, leaders have little margin to spare in securing a majority. The party has also moved significantly to the right since then, making Republicans far less interested in collaborating with Democrats.  This ideological cleavage within the GOP complicates McConnell’s ability to cobble a deal. It’s hard to satisfy both sides of the Republican spectrum. The most conservative senators say that McConnell’s plan leaves too much of Obamacare in place. More pragmatic senators want to save some of the more popular elements of Obamacare, especially if they’re from purple states or from red states where the Republican governor wants to keep the expanded Medicaid that came with the ACA. And with only 52 Republicans in the chamber, McConnell can afford to lose no more than two votes. 2. There’s no clear deadline. Most heavy legislative lifting in recent years has come on “must-pass” bills before a pressing deadline, like measures to avoid defaulting on the government’s debt or passing a budget to avoid shutting down the government. When lawmakers want to avoid blame for causing a disaster, the central dealmaker has a lever for pressuring for compromise. President Trump has claimed that “Obamacare is dead,” suggesting that senators have no choice but to act. But few seem to believe him. [This is why so many Republicans are ready to ignore public opinion on health care] 3. Live by the rules, die by the rules. Republicans are using arcane budget rules called “reconciliation” so that they can prevent Democrats from filibustering, knowing that Democrats were never going to join the GOP to undo President Barack Obama’s landmark legislation. But these constraints also make it harder for McConnell to forge a compromise. Under these rules, only provisions that affect government spending and taxes can be squeezed into the bill. The bill’s heavy dose of tax cuts for the wealthy must be fully paid for by other provisions in the bill to meet Congress’s demand that the bill not increase the deficit. All that means the rules limit how far McConnell can go to convince individual senators to support the bill. 4. Secrecy seems to have backfired. McConnell and his staff largely drafted this bill in secret, hoping to speed the final package through a notoriously slow-moving Senate. If negotiated in the open by committees, the party’s slim, divided majorities on key Senate panels might have doomed the bill. But centralized, secret bargaining that kept many senators in the dark for so long is making matters worse for McConnell. He now struggles to bridge those divisions at the last minute. So what comes next? During the legislative recess, can Senate GOP leaders regroup to secure a winning deal? It’s possible. Recall that a larger House Republican conference also initially faltered in its drive to pass a bill. Conservatives then refocused negotiations and pulled the bill to the right — and it passed the House. Many senators claimed that the House bill was dead on arrival and would have to be moderated, given senators’ much larger and naturally more diverse constituencies than those of their counterparts in the House. [Is democracy on the decline? Not as much as some pundits want you to believe] And yet the current Senate version looks suspiciously like the House bill — even, perhaps, more draconian in its Medicaid cuts. There’s always a chance the president will demean the Senate bill, undercutting GOP support. Delay surely complicates — and may doom — McConnell’s partisan attempt to push conservative policy swiftly through the Senate with a fractured and tenuous majority.

GOP governors outshine Beltway Trumpkins,"President Trump and Republican advocates of one or another version of Trumpcare — all of which contemplate huge cuts to Medicaid — had better not mess with GOP governors, many of whom have been outspoken opponents of cuts to Medicaid. Unlike Trump, whose approval rating is at a historic low, or GOP lawmakers, whose performance draws scorn from a large majority of Americans, GOP governors are among the most popular officials in the country, with approval ratings D.C. politicians can only dream about. (In late June, the Quinnipiac University poll found 70 percent of voters disapproved of Republicans’ performance in Congress; only 25 percent approved.) The latest Morning Consult poll shows several GOP governors with astronomically high approval ratings: [Massachusetts Gov. Charlie] Baker and [Maryland Gov. Larry] Hogan, two canny dealmakers who have largely eschewed the national political scene and have been unsupportive of President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans’ efforts to repeal and replace significant parts of Obamacare, continue to enjoy the support of a large share of voters in traditionally Democratic states ahead of their 2018 re-election bids. Seventy-one percent of Massachusetts voters said they approve of Baker while 68 percent of Marylanders back Hogan. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, another Republican governor in a bluish state who has opposed efforts by Republicans in Washington to overhaul health care, also retains his place as one of the most popular governors in the country. Sixty-two percent of Nevadans back the two-term governor who is preparing to leave office next year. Other Republicans in purple or blue states including Ohio Gov. John Kasich (57 percent approval to 30 percent disapproval) and Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (62 percent approval to 23 percent disapproval) also post impressive numbers. It’s one thing for a rock-ribbed conservative to get strong approval ratings in a deep red state, but what’s more interesting — and more critical for the GOP’s future — is how Republicans fare in states with diverse populations and a history of voting Democratic. Scott, Hogan and Baker share a basic formula: “With Republicans controlling 33 of 50 governorships, the three state leaders stand out for their pragmatic, relatively nonpartisan approaches to governing alongside legislatures dominated by Democrats. And, crucially, each has kept their distance from Trump, a reviled figure among large swaths of their constituents.” These governors’ attention to voters as opposed to national ideologues and willingness to work with Democratic legislatures account for much of their success: “It may seem odd that Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is so popular in Massachusetts, one of the country’s bluest states,” said Boston College Law Professor Richard Albert, via email. “But there is no secret to his success: He has run the commonwealth successfully as a nonpartisan manager.” “He has left few traces of an ideologue — something that would not fly for any Republican in this state — and has instead rolled up his sleeves to fix the problems of everyday people,” Albert added. … “Gov. Phil Scott campaigned in 2016 on a ‘take it slow, low tax’ platform and that’s how he’s governed,” Johnson said by email. “In his first legislative session as governor, he successfully came across as an advocate for taxpayers’ interests by making proposals that spoke to people’s pocketbooks – particularly on school budget issues. These initiatives did not always succeed in the form Scott proposed them – and they were occasionally abrupt and ill-timed. But he put the Democratic majorities in the legislature, themselves under new leadership, on their back foot for the latter part of the session.” In Ohio, Kasich has been among the most vocal Republican critics of Trump, defending Medicaid expansion, criticizing his unpresidential tone and lambasting his travel ban. Moreover, he has governed in an inclusive manner, as a fiscal conservative and pro-business advocate who nevertheless takes seriously government’s responsibility to vulnerable Americans. He has refused to drink the Trump Kool-Aid on huge tax cuts for the rich. In April at Harvard Kennedy School, he sounded like a grown-up: Describing the tax plan unveiled by the Trump administration earlier in the day as a “not properly balanced package,” Kasich said, “There’s no way you can cut all these taxes and then say, ‘OK, everything will be paid for.’ That’s like Christmas.” Kasich said he thought the journey to restructure the tax system would be a long one. “There will be people who express concern about the debt,” said Kasich, who chaired the House Budget Committee while in Congress. “We do need a lower corporate tax rate,” he added. One of the country’s most immediate concerns involves the state of the education system, which Kasich says is failing to provide many Americans with the skills, resilience, and creativity to meet the economy’s future employment needs. “You can’t take a coal miner and just say ‘Tough,’ or say, ‘By the way, I’m going to make America great, and we’re going to open all the mines [again],’ ” Kasich argued. Instead, he suggested, the country needs to offer new modes of education, including competency-based learning and new forms of online training. “This whole education system needs to change, or I will personally be part of intermediating it, because it’s not working,” he said. Are these governors — rhetorically retrained, fiscally responsible, attentive to the safety net and willing to work across the aisle — the future of the Republican Party or the core of a center-right political movement that no longer finds a home in the national GOP? For now, they remain a reminder that the GOP historically was not and need not be an anti-intellectual, anti-factual, xenophobic cult. Unfortunately, it’s Trump’s party now, and the future of responsible center-right governance at the national level is bleak.

Surprise! Republicans weren’t exactly leveling with you about health care all along!,
Don’t blame the moderates for the health-care debacle,"With the announcement from Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) that she would not vote for repeal (at least as defined by the 2015 reconciliation bill that would leave 32 million more Americans uninsured) with no replacement, the whole dreary episode of Republican hypocrisy on Obamacare can come to an end. Capito’s statement said plainly: As I have said before, I did not come to Washington to hurt people. For months, I have expressed reservations about the direction of the bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. I have serious concerns about how we continue to provide affordable care to those who have benefited from West Virginia’s decision to expand Medicaid, especially in light of the growing opioid crisis. All of the Senate health care discussion drafts have failed to address these concerns adequately. My position on this issue is driven by its impact on West Virginians. With that in mind, I cannot vote to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians. Those on the right who argue that she is being disingenuous because she voted for the 2015 act knowing it would be vetoed are themselves being disingenuous. There was nothing wrong with casting a protest vote then and now acknowledging that since the GOP has not a clue how to replace Obamacare, it would be cruel and unwise to pull the plug on the Affordable Care Act. Capito and fellow moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) had the nerve to come out unequivocally, as their male colleagues hemmed and hawed (“serious concerns!” “very troubled!”), to put an end to a legislative charade. It’s not the moderates who have been disingenuous here. They actually took seriously the position that a better health-care bill could be devised. They were not the ones who insisted on making this a tax cut for the super-rich by removing the funding mechanism for health-care reform or by throwing Medicaid cuts into the hopper. They wanted to solve the problem Republicans had identified originally — health-care exchanges in the individual market that did not provide affordable (enough) health care and that suffered from an acute case of adverse selection despite the individual mandate. On the disingenuous scale, no one beats President Trump, who never had a health-care plan, never understood what was in any bill and never explained how he’d come up with a miraculous bill that would cover everyone without breaking the bank. Next, consider the right-wingers who opposed the Better Care Reconciliation Act — and the House bill and every other variation — but were willing to vote for repeal with the promise of a replacement in two years. Where in the world do they think is the replacement bill that the GOP could arrive at in two — or 20 — years? If they simply want to go back to pre-Obamacare days, they should have said so; instead, their current position in favor of the 2015 reconciliation act is surely the worst of all options. (Regulations remain, costs soar, tens of millions lose health care.) Sorry, but Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), etc., are no heroes. Then take a look at Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who reportedly told moderates that the Medicaid cuts were phony, threatened his own members with a repeal vote that he knew would be unpalatable and never let on that the GOP promises (more coverage, fewer out-of-pocket costs, big tax cuts) were impossible. He seemed willing to sacrifice his most vulnerable members (e.g. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada) rather than tell the White House that the jig was up. So much for his reputation as a legislative genius. But the award for the most disingenuous man in the GOP goes to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Without the benefit of a Congressional Budget Office score, he rammed through a measure that had no chance of passing in the Senate, did not expand coverage or lower costs for the most vulnerable, falsely advertised its protections for those with preexisting conditions (the meager support for high-risk pools would cover a fraction of the cost for hard-to-insure people in states that opted out of minimum benefit requirements) and catered to his right-wing members in safe seats at the expense of moderates who will be vulnerable in 2018. There’s plenty of blame to go around, but let’s not blame the moderates in the GOP who refused to be bullied and stood up, however belatedly, for the most vulnerable Americans. UPDATE: A third moderate GOP woman, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), has thrown a bucket of cold water on repeal-and-delay. “As I’ve been saying, the Senate should take a step back and engage in a bipartisan process to address the failures of the ACA and stabilize the individual markets. That will require members on both sides of the aisle to roll up their sleeves and take this to the open committee process where it belongs,” she said in a written statement. She concluded that she “cannot vote to proceed to repeal the ACA without reform that allows people the choice they want, the affordability they need and the quality of care they deserve.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

"Raging over the health bill’s failure, Trump will soon make an even crueler move","THE MORNING PLUM: Now that the GOP health bill has imploded in the Senate, it’s fitting, in a way, that President Trump is now demanding in a rage that Senate Republicans vote on straight repeal only. If that play fails, as many analysts seem to expect, it will neatly capture just how saturated in cruelty, dishonesty and bad faith the Republican approach — and, more recently, that of Trump — has been all along. The Senate bill’s prospects collapsed last night after two senators — Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas — announced they would vote against the motion to proceed to debate on the most recent version of the measure. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) then admitted that the current repeal effort “will not be successful” and said the Senate will soon vote on a version of repeal (with a replacement supposedly to follow at some point) that passed in 2015 but was vetoed by former president Barack Obama. Trump himself endorsed this approach: Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2017  But here’s what this really means. Moderate GOP senators — whose concerns had compelled GOP leaders to craft a “softer” version of the health bill that did not repeal Obamacare’s tax hikes on the rich — will now have to vote on a version that does repeal the ACA’s tax hikes on the wealthy, while leading to a substantially larger loss of coverage. In short, moderates will now have to vote on a version that’s even crueler and more regressive than the one that just failed. The version that just collapsed had restored the ACA’s 3.8 percent tax on net investment income and its 0.9 percent Medicare surtax, because moderate Republicans had objected to an earlier version that repealed those taxes. That made the latest version somewhat less regressive than the last one, and it might have meant that the coverage loss might have been marginally smaller than the 22 million that would have lost coverage under that earlier version. But now that this approach has imploded, Republicans are set to embark on a process that will culminate in a vote on a repeal-only bill. As it happens, the Congressional Budget Office scored that bill, and it’s a lot worse, on multiple levels. Nicholas Bagley, a health policy expert at the University of Michigan, explained it this way in an email to me: After facing intense criticism for a repeal-and-replace bill that would have eliminated coverage for 23 million people, McConnell is apparently reviving a repeal bill that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, would lead 32 million people to lose coverage, including 18 million in 2018 alone. The repeal bill is also more regressive: in contrast to the current Senate bill, it would extend $230 billion in tax relief to the wealthiest Americans. That means senators will have to vote on a bill that’s both crueler and less equitable than the bill that just collapsed, which was plenty cruel and inequitable to begin with. Recall that the latest version (which just collapsed) came after moderate Republican senators (such as Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee) explicitly objected to an earlier version on the grounds that cutting hundreds of billions in health-care spending on poor people to finance a huge tax cut for the rich was morally unacceptable. Other moderate Republicans (such as Dean Heller of Nevada, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, and Rob Portman of Ohio) have objected to rolling back Medicaid for enormous numbers of people on humanitarian grounds. They will now vote on a version that cuts taxes more deeply for rich people, and rolls back coverage for many more millions of poor people, than the one that just collapsed. But, should this fail, as seems likely, since moderate GOP senators will probably recoil, this will amount to a form of poetic justice. Republicans spent years calling and voting for repeal-only, secure in the knowledge that Barack Obama would veto it, meaning they would not be forced to grapple with the consequences of it actually happening. Now Trump is demanding that Republicans vote for repeal on the understanding that he would sign it immediately, with no guarantee of any replacement later. Whether he knows it or not, Trump is calling their years-long bluff. It’s unclear from the reporting why McConnell is pushing this: Perhaps he believes it can actually pass, or perhaps he believes he needs to demonstrate to conservative groups and base voters that straight repeal cannot pass, so that he can move on to negotiations with Democrats over ways to shore up the individual markets without cutting taxes on the rich and dramatically slashing the ACA’s historic coverage expansion. Or perhaps McConnell has some other devious strategy to come back to a repeal vote that we don’t know about. But whatever his thinking, the upshot of holding this vote, should it fail, will be to reveal that Republicans were never actually willing to repeal the ACA as long as they thought it would never actually happen. The whole thing was a scam all along — Republicans promised to repeal the ACA and replace it with something that did all the good things in it (the coverage expansion; the consumer protections) without the bad (the taxes; the mandates), but they never had any way of doing anything like that. This would also be a fitting end because it would unmask Trump’s own long-running scam. Trump sent strong signals during the campaign that he is not ideologically in sync with Paul Ryan’s designs on the safety net; he promised not to cut Medicaid; and he vowed “insurance for everybody.” But then Trump and the White House fully embraced an enormously cruel and regressive Ryanesque rollback of the ACA’s coverage gains. They employed endless lies and distortions to cover up their own bill’s true ideological designs. But now that this failed, Trump is demanding a vote on something even more cruel and regressive — full repeal — solely because he is so eager to triumphantly stomp all over something with Obama’s name on it and call that a “win.” That’s all this was ever about, and that is now confirmed. Update: It’s now being widely reported that senators Shelley Moore Capito, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski all will oppose the motion to proceed to the vote on full repeal. What happens next is unclear, but this strategy, too, looks dead. Which confirms the points I’ve tried to make above. * WALL STREET JOURNAL TO TRUMP: TIME FOR FULL TRANSPARENCY: The Wall Street Journal editorial board calls on Trump to show full transparency about everything related to the Russia probe, including releasing his tax returns: Release everything to the public ahead of the inevitable leaks … tell every Trump family member, campaign operative and White House aide to disclose every detail that might be relevant to the Russian investigations. That means every meeting with any Russian or any American with Russian business ties. Every phone call or email. And every Trump business relationship with Russians going back years. This should include every relevant part of Mr. Trump’s tax returns … If there really is nothing to the Russia collusion allegations, transparency will prove it. Yeah, I’m sure Trump will get right on that. * TRUMP JR. IS VERY FORTHCOMING, HIS LAWYER SAYS. SORT OF: Donald Trump Jr.’s first statement falsely claimed the meeting with the Russian lawyer was primarily about an adoption program. Now the Associated Press reports: Alan Futerfas, the attorney for the president’s son, said Trump Jr. had been “absolutely prepared” to make a “fulsome statement” about how the meeting was arranged and what discussions took place. He did not respond to questions about why the initial statement about the matter, which was seen by the president, lacked some of those details. Friendly reminder: The president himself reportedly signed off on this false statement. * HOUSE GOP BUDGET CUTS MEDICARE, SOCIAL SECURITY: The Post reports that House Republicans have unveiled a new 2018 budget plan that would deeply cut spending. Note this: Unlike Trump’s budget, the House proposal cuts into Medicare and Social Security — entitlement programs that the president has pledged to preserve … The House blueprint won a strong endorsement from White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, who served on the House Budget Committee before joining the Trump administration. Wait, but Trump promised he would never … oh, never mind. * A NEW PUSH TO WIN ON STATE LEVEL: Politico reports that North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, is unveiling a new push to win back the state legislature, one that Democrats hope will become a template for other such efforts elsewhere: National Democrats, reeling from losing hundreds of seats in statehouses across the country over the last decade, are hoping other governors pay close attention. Cooper’s initiative is the latest frontier in a state that’s a cauldron of just about every political fight in America — redistricting, voter ID, public education, gender. And as I’ve noted, winning back this ground, particularly in the 2018 elections, will be crucial for boosting the Democratic Party’s prospects in the next decade. * LOW TRUST IN TRUMP TO HANDLE NORTH KOREA: A new Post-ABC News poll finds that 74 percent of Americans are concerned that the United States will get involved in a “full scale war with North Korea.” And: The Post-ABC poll finds lagging confidence in Trump to handle the situation, with 36 percent saying they trust Trump at least “a good amount” to deal with the issue, while 63 percent have “just some” or less confidence. Four in 10 say they do not trust Trump “at all” on the issue, nearly twice the number who express “a great deal” of confidence. Just imagine what Trump’s Twitter feed would look like if this possibility really loomed, and how much damage that could do. * TRUMP KEEPS LYING ABOUT NUMBER OF LAWS HE’S SIGNED: Trump keeps claiming he has signed more laws — 42 — than other president. The New York Times does the debunking: Mr. Trump is slightly behind the lawmaking pace for the past six presidents, who as a group signed an average of 43 bills during the same period. And an analysis of the bills Mr. Trump signed shows that about half were minor and inconsequential, passed by Congress with little debate. Among recent presidents, both the total number of bills he signed and the legislation’s substance make Mr. Trump about average. Yes, but laws signed by Trump get to be counted twice, because Trump said so, and his supporters believe him. * AND TRUMP JUST WANTS A ‘WIN’: As Trumpcare collapses, Politico reports on Trump’s, er, thinking: To Trump, the Obamacare fight has always been about scoring a win. He doesn’t care nearly as much about the specifics, people close to him say, and hasn’t understood why legislators just won’t make deals and bring something, anything to his desk. Of course. Trump simply does not care in the least about how the bill might impact millions of people and one-sixth of the U.S. economy, as long as he gets to triumphantly stomp all over something with Barack Obama’s name on it.

How cartoons are poking fun at the doomed GOP health-care bill,"IS “WINTERCARE” here in Washington’s own Game of Thrones? Thorny is the throne for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), as rendered by Columbus Dispatch cartoonist Nate Beeler — especially as two more Senate Republicans, including his own kingdom ally Sen. Jerry Moran (Kan.) — pronounce their opposition to the now-collapsed health-care overhaul plan, as The Washington Post reports. In the land of political dragons, they will not be dragooned. [Trump suggests Republicans will let ACA market collapse, then rewrite health law] Elsewhere, Clay Bennett of the Chattanooga Times Free Press unpacks the side effects of attempts at McConnellCare, illustrating what he believes to be endlessly unappealing about what the failed GOP plan.

"The Daily 202: After Senate bill falls apart, Republicans don’t have the votes to repeal Obamacare","Mitch McConnell walks yesterday around the Capitol. (Andrew Harnik/AP) THE BIG IDEA: A last-gasp Hail Mary for full repeal of Obamacare appears certain to fail. There are not the votes in either chamber of Congress. Mitch McConnell pulled the second draft of his health-care bill last night after two more Republican senators came out against even bringing it up for debate on the floor: Utah’s Mike Lee and Kansas’s Jerry Moran. “Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,” the Senate majority leader said in a statement sent at 10:47 p.m. He announced that he’ll bring the bill that already passed the House up for consideration “in the coming days,” and the first amendment the Senate would take up would be for the full repeal of Obamacare (with a two-year delay for implementation). But to get that vote on repeal, conservative critics must vote to allow debate on the broader bill. If the clean vote for full repeal failed, as it almost certainly would, senators could continue making additional amendments that may make the measure even more unpalatable to conservatives. GOP lawmakers have voted repeatedly to repeal Obamacare, and the Senate even passed a bill with this exact same language in 2015. But Barack Obama was president then, and it was a safe vote because everyone knew he’d veto it. This would no longer be a show vote. -- Sean Sullivan explains that the wily Kentuckian’s announcement amounts to a dare: “McConnell practically challenged conservative critics of the bill to vote against moving the process ahead. … If hard-right conservative senators vote no on proceeding with the bill and it collapses, McConnell can come back at them and say, ‘Well, you had your chance at the ‘clean repeal’ you demanded. And you decided not to take it.’ He will have shifted some of the blame onto others and given himself a new talking point to counter the ‘clean repeal’ crowd — which includes President Trump. If they vote yes — hey, they’re suddenly back on track, at the table debating legislation with at least some chance of passing.” What’s less clear at this point is McConnell’s end game. “If this doesn’t work out,” Sean wonders, “will he move on to other matters? Follow through on his threats to work with Democrats and narrower reforms, which were seen as ways to try to pressure conservatives not to let this fail? … There are no longer any good outcomes for McConnell — politically speaking. There are bad ones and less bad ones. And putting the onus on other senators means there will be more blame to go around when this all ends.” -- The Republican conference remains deeply divided. While Lee announced that he’s against the bill because “it doesn’t go far enough,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) opposed the measure because it goes too far. There are several senators on each side of that divide. “We must now start fresh with an open legislative process…,” Moran said in his statement announcing opposition to the latest version. “This closed-door process has yielded the BCRA, which fails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address healthcare’s rising costs. For the same reasons I could not support the previous version of this bill, I cannot support this one. … We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy.” Sen. John McCain, recovering from surgery in Arizona, called on Republicans to begin working with Democrats to fix the system in a statement sent at 10:16 p.m.: “One of the major problems with Obamacare was that it was written on a strict party-line basis and driven through Congress without a single Republican vote. As this law continues to crumble in Arizona and states across the country, we must not repeat the original mistakes that led to Obamacare’s failure. The Congress must now return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation's governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), likely to face a primary from his right in 2020, encouraged McConnell to take up an alternative plan he released last week with Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.): It's time for a new approach when it comes to #RepealandReplace of Obamacare. (1/4) https://t.co/wOwJRzvJCi Graham-Cassidy is the conservative approach to solving the problems Obamacare created. READ MORE: https://t.co/2S2mVa80zn (4/4) Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) had hinted yesterday, before McConnell pulled the bill, that he might vote against advancing the measure to floor debate, as well. He publicly expressed frustration with comments by McConnell, intended to reassure senators like Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, that the bill’s deepest Medicaid cuts are far into the future and are unlikely to ever actually go into effect. Johnson said he read about these private comments in The Health 202 last Thursday and then confirmed them with other senators. “If our leader is basically saying don't worry about it, we've designed it so that those reforms will never take effect, first of all, that's a pretty significant breach of trust,” Johnson told the Green Bay Press-Gazette. “And why support the bill then?” -- Reporters who are following the debate most closely don’t think McConnell’s gambit will work. From our senior congressional correspondent: Folks - there will be no vote on '15 repeal-only. The only way that can happen is if Lee-Rand-RonJohn, others vote to begin BCRA debate 1/ They have said they won't vote to begin debate. Even if they change their mind, they get 1 vote on repeal-only & 200~ other amendments 2/ Rand/Lee/RonJohn/others would likely lose that repeal-only amendment vote & then the underlying bill/vote-a-rama would go on and on. 3/ So, why would Rand/Lee/RonJohn begin debate on a bill they hate with little guarantee of an outcome they like? Not likely to happen. 4/4 From one of The Post’s political reporters: Privately, several House mbrs and Sns told me for weeks they didn't really want to pass it. Like groom w/ cold feet, after long engagement. What many Rs wanted was to check box without political cost. Passionless effort. Saw Dems salivating at what passage meant for '18. Cringed. What this became at the end was a Medicaid debate that very few Rs wanted to have. Fighting Obamacare"" fine"
Is Trumpcare finally dead?,"Perhaps the two “no” votes from Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) would have been enough to sink the GOP health-care effort. Senate Republicans and virtually all political watchers have been cultivating a sense of suspense — who would be the third “no” vote? — when in fact there are likely, according to Collins, many more “no” votes (eight to 10, she said in TV interviews Sunday). Then a very public and simple barrier to passage emerged — Sen. John McCain’s (R-Ariz.) undetermined recuperation time. With two “no” votes already clinched, Senate GOP leaders could not even pretend to have sufficient support without McCain (who actually might be a “no” vote in the end). Now comes perhaps the death knell for Trumpcare: Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) both announced their opposition Monday night. To be clear, the Better Care Reconciliation Act was already at death’s door before McCain took ill and before Lee and Moran’s announcements. A handful of moderates continue to refuse to stomach huge Medicaid cuts. In an act of exceptional duplicity, McConnell reportedly told moderates not to worry about Medicaid cuts (presumably because Congress will never have the nerve to go through with them), which understandably angered conservatives. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson told a Wisconsin paper, “I am concerned about Leader McConnell’s comments to apparently some of my Republican colleagues — ‘Don’t worry about some of the Medicaid reforms, those are scheduled so far in the future they’ll never take effect.’ I’ve got to confirm those comments. … I think those comments are going to really put the motion to proceed in jeopardy, whether it’s on my part or others.” He continued: “Many of us, one of the main reasons we are willing to support a bill that doesn’t even come close to repealing Obamacare … was because at least we were devolving the management back to the states, and putting some level of sustainability into an unsustainable entitlement program. If our leader is basically saying don’t worry about it, we’ve designed it so that those reforms will never take effect, first of all, that’s a pretty significant breach of trust, and why support the bill then?” Additional time has never been an asset for the administration. The more time that passes, the more anger Team Trump seems to induce in wavering members. CNN reported: [Vice President] Pence and top Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verma were deployed to Rhode Island over the weekend to meet with skeptical governors at the National Governors Association’s summer meeting. In private meetings, Pence and Verma tried to convince governors that the GOP’s health care bill would give them greater flexibility to design Medicaid programs that were better tailored to their needs. But the weekend didn’t go especially well for the administration. After a speech in which Pence claimed 60,000 disabled Ohioans were waiting to get care, a spokesman for Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich dismissed the claim as false on Twitter. [Connecticut Democratic Gov. Dan] Malloy described Pence’s private meeting with the governors Saturday as “pretty atrocious” as Pence encouraged governors to dismiss an unfavorable score from the Congressional Budget Office that showed 15 million Americans would lose Medicaid coverage over the next decade. And of course the Congressional Budget Office’s scoring on the newest version of the bill has yet to come out. Each time the CBO has produced a score, decried as fake by the White House, a spasm of concern has gripped the Republican caucus. Republicans get cold(er) feet with each reminder of how many people will lose insurance, be cut off from Medicaid and/or have to pay more for coverage. On the floor of the Senate, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) needled Republicans, imploring them to use the time to secure a CBO score and to hold hearings on the bill. (He told Republicans they should “use this extra week, or extra weeks, to do what Republicans should have done a long time ago: hold public hearings. Allow the stakeholders to come in and express their concerns.” That idea likely sends shivers down the spines of most Republicans as they contemplate the parade of doctors, patients, insurers, advocates for the elderly and other witnesses who would come forward.) In sum, given the choice between holding up the Senate until McCain returns and changing at least two of the declared “no” votes, or moving on so as to avoid the agony of extended dismal coverage and the humiliation of a losing vote on the floor, wouldn’t Republicans rather proceed to the debt limit, the budget and tax reform? Let’s be candid: McConnell knows that forcing some of his members (especially Dean Heller of Nevada) to vote in support of a grossly unpopular bill would be a political death sentence. He cannot in his heart of hearts be thrilled with the prospect of a vote, especially one he will now almost certainly lose; all he need to do is show he tried everything possible. Initially, McConnell may have figured a ridiculously early deadline for a vote in July could have cleared the decks (win or lose), but now he has a ready-made excuse for ditching the whole exercise. Sure, they can come back to the bill — sometime. Gosh, if only McCain hadn’t gotten ill. Well, now we’ve got four “no” votes. Let a hundred excuses bloom. UPDATE: McCain has now chimed in with what amounts to a fifth “no” vote. In a written statement he declares, “One of the major problems with Obamacare was that it was written on a strict party-line basis and driven through Congress without a single Republican vote. As this law continues to crumble in Arizona and states across the country, we must not repeat the original mistakes that led to Obamacare’s failure.” He urges Congress to “return to regular order, hold hearings, receive input from members of both parties, and heed the recommendations of our nation’s governors so that we can produce a bill that finally provides Americans with access to quality and affordable health care.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

Happy Hour Roundup,"* Matt Fuller reports that the GOP health care bill is an a weird limbo: The Senate health care bill remains in a curious state of buoyancy ― without enough support to go anywhere, but lacking enough opposition to sink. Simply put: The bill is not dead, despite Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) vowing to vote against it and a healthy coalition of more than a half-dozen Republicans who have “serious concerns,” according to Collins. With Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) recovering from a surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) officially does not have the votes to bring the GOP health care bill to the floor. Facing that reality, he delayed the vote yet again. But there’s a lesson in that delay: McConnell believes he can actually pass this. If he didn’t, with the backlog of legislative items already keeping senators in session into their August break, he could just take a failed vote and clear the measure from his calendar. He’s not doing that ― at least not yet. Twenty million Americans who’ll lose their coverage have “serious concerns” too. * Matthew Lee reports on some interesting negotiations going on with the Russians: The United States and Russia on Monday resumed high-level talks aimed at resolving irritants between Washington and Moscow, as Russian patience dwindles for the return of two seized diplomatic compounds. Undersecretary of State Tom Shannon and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov were meeting on Monday. U.S. officials downplayed chances for a breakthrough, especially since Russia abruptly canceled the diplomats’ last scheduled meeting in June in response to new Ukraine-related sanctions. Ryabkov did not respond to a reporter’s shouted question as he arrived at the State Department with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergey Kislyak. The Russians were told by the Obama administration to vacate those compounds as punishment for their attack on our election. If Trump gives them back — especially without getting something significant in return — it would speak volumes. * Alex Isenstadt reports that the White House is meeting with potential primary challengers to Arizona senator Jeff Flake. Frankly, a failed challenge from a Trump-endorsed right-winger would be a tremendous gift to Flake in the general election. * Norm Ornstein says that in almost a half-century of observing Congress’ foibles, the process by which Republicans are trying to push through their health care bill is the most messed up he’s seen. * Mark Hand tells the story of how an obscure think tank with ties to the Koch brothers is working from inside the Trump administration to reorient American policy away from renewable energy and back to fossil fuel. * Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia report that White House trade czar Peter Navarro’s views are so extreme that even his fellow Trump aides worry he’ll convince the president to start a trade war. * Los Angeles Times reporter Michael Hiltzik shares a personal experience demonstrating Vice President Mike Pence’s colossal, despicable dishonesty about the Affordable Care Act. * Jason Sattler says that Trumpcare’s assault on Americans with disabilities shows how hollow the GOP’s claim of being “pro-life” really is. * Ruth Marcus discerns in Trump’s legal strategy the hints of a plan to delegitimize the Mueller investigation and lay the groundwork for Trump to pardon everybody. * Carolyn Johnson explains why the GOP health bill could lead to significant premium increases for those who get coverage through their employers. * Brian Beutler argues that in defending the Russia scandal Republicans have abandoned any pretense of morality. * At the American Prospect, I argued that while Trump may be a con artist, he’s also the easiest mark there is. * And Margaret Sullivan explains why Trump won’t ever stop claiming information he doesn’t like is “fake news,” even when it comes from people like his own son.

"Break-in, ‘threatening note’ at office of GOP senator considered swing vote in health-care bill","Police said a “threatening note” was found over the weekend after a break-in at the Las Vegas office of Sen. Dean Heller, a Republican who could be a critical swing vote on the GOP health-care bill. Las Vegas police said officers responded to a call about a burglary alarm Saturday morning at Heller’s office in southwest Las Vegas. There, they discovered what they described in a statement as a “threatening note” addressed to Heller (R-Nev.) near the door to his office. The Nevada Independent’s Jon Ralston reported that the note was related to the Senate’s upcoming vote on the GOP’s health-care bill: A note taped to Sen. Dean Heller’s campaign office was from someone asserting that he would lose his health care if the key senator voted for the repeal bill and that he would die if that happened and would take Heller with him, a law enforcement source said. Police said Monday that they would not disclose the contents of the note, citing an ongoing investigation. Megan Taylor, a spokeswoman for Heller, confirmed the break-in but said that she could not comment, because of the investigation. Heller has been under pressure from the left and the right over his vote on the health-care bill. Republican lawmakers have been steadfast for years in their promise to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature health-care measure — a pledge Donald Trump frequently invoked on the campaign trail. However, as The Washington Post’s David Weigel pointed out, Heller is the only Senate Republican facing reelection in 2018 in a state won by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last year. His unique position has made him the focus of several advertising campaigns trying to lobby for his vote. Last month, Heller came out against an earlier iteration of the GOP’s health-care bill, becoming the fifth Republican senator to do so at the time. At a June 23 news conference, Heller said he was particularly concerned about potential cuts to Medicaid, as well as the impending loss of insurance for those struggling with mental-health and substance-abuse issues. “I’m telling you right now, I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes away insurance from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,” Heller said then. Three weeks later, Heller is in no less a precarious spot when it comes to voting on the GOP’s new proposal to remake the ACA, unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) last week. Two Republican senators — Susan Collins (Maine) and Rand Paul (Ky.) — have publicly said they continue to oppose the GOP’s health-care bill. Just one more no vote from a Republican senator would mean the bill would not have the 50 votes it needs to pass. When Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced over the weekend that he needed to recover from surgery and would be absent from a vote, McConnell said the Senate would postpone it. The incident at Heller’s office follows similar incidents involving other GOP senators in recent weeks. Over the July Fourth recess, a protester was arrested outside the Tucson office of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) after allegedly asking a staffer: “You know how liberals are going to solve the Republican problem? They are going to get better aim.” And an Omaha man was arrested this month after walking into an Iowa motorcycle shop and allegedly saying that he “could kill” Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who was scheduled to visit the shop the next day. [Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval still doesn’t support the Senate health-care bill. That’s big trouble for Republicans.] The break-in also came just three days after the Federal Election Commission ruled that House and Senate lawmakers may now use campaign funds to pay for security upgrades at their personal homes — a change from previous rulings that required lawmakers to petition the panel on a case-by-case basis. But after warnings from House and Senate security officials in the wake of the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.), the FEC said that security upgrades now qualify as “ordinary and necessary expenses” lawmakers incur as part of official duties. Security upgrades at congressional district offices are handled with taxpayer funding, and Congress is preparing to spend tens of millions more dollars to protect lawmakers and their staffs. All 435 House lawmakers are receiving $25,000 in emergency funding added to their annual office allowances to be used for any security purpose — a nearly $10.9 million expense that can be used to add bulletproof windows at district offices or to hire a private security guard for public events back home. And at least $5 million is earmarked for the House sergeant at arms to pay for security upgrades at House district offices that face threats or are considered vulnerable. The Senate, which has fewer district offices to protect, has not yet allotted such money. Responsibility for securing Senate district offices, which are usually found in federal buildings or courthouses, depends on the location. If it shares space with a federal agency that also has a law enforcement responsibility, that agency probably provides protection. If the office is in a courthouse, U.S. marshals probably provide security. But if the office is in a private building, a senator’s staff has probably made arrangements with local police or the building’s private security officers to keep an eye on the location.

"Cruz outflanked on the right, pummeled on policy","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has a fundamental problem: His political ambition far outstrips his likability and political skill. In the 2016 primary, his rudeness to Senate colleagues, glaring opportunism and awkward interpersonal skills — as much as then-candidate Donald Trump — prevented him from capturing the nomination. His off-again, on-again endorsement of Trump in the summer of 2016 merely confirmed that he lacked the skill to conceal his own hypocrisy. Realizing he’d made no friends and claimed no legislative achievements in his first four years in the Senate, Cruz decided this year he’d shed his image as an obstructionist grandstander and adopt the pose of a diligent dealmaker on health care, the issue he used to stage a government shutdown in 2013. However, Cruz, perpetually convinced that he is the smartest man in any room, failed to master the fundamentals of health-care policy, or to anticipate that fellow conservatives might actually stand on principle. As a result, his half-baked plan to permit insurers to offer unregulated plans as long as they offered one that conformed to the Affordable Care Act requirements belly-flopped. It did not take long before major insurers lowered the boom on Cruz, blasting his plan in an unusual, joint letter: It is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market. . . . This would allow the new plans to “cherry pick” only healthy people from the existing market making coverage unaffordable for the millions of people who need or want comprehensive coverage, including, for example, coverage for prescription drugs and mental health services. They explained: “As healthy people move to the less-regulated plans, those with significant medical needs will have no choice but to stay in the comprehensive plans, and premiums will skyrocket for people with preexisting conditions. This would especially impact middle-income families that that are not eligible for a tax credit.” Surely Cruz could have consulted with insurers and independent health-care experts to determine whether his plan was viable. Perhaps he wasn’t interested in finding out the answer, or perhaps he proceeded in the face of obvious flaws. In any event, he cemented his image as a man with a personal agenda, but no real policy expertise. Even more disastrously for Cruz, he found himself outflanked on the right, when Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) balked at the plan. CNBC reported: Paul actually said Wednesday that the Cruz amendment could make his problems with the Senate bill worse. The policy could drive up costs for people in the Obamacare markets . . . which the federal government would then have to step in and subsidize to prevent a death spiral. “The impressions and the rumors that we’re hearing is that’s gonna mean a lot more money in insurance bailout fund and ultimately also mean some sort of price controls,” Paul said on the conference call, adding that was “foreign to any notion of capitalism.” Lee was blindsided by Cruz’s last-minute changes. (“Significant daylight has emerged between the Senate’s dynamic conservative duo. Once shoulder to shoulder on healthcare reform with his longtime friend, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has decided to go his own way.”) At the very least, he wants more time to consider the Cruz amendment. In sum, Cruz is left championing a bill that is substantively unworkable and shunned by more principled right-wing Republicans. Cruz’s too-cute-by-half machinations leave him politically isolated, once again. At some point, one has to ask whether elected office is really Cruz’s forte. He seems to lack the interpersonal skills and legislative judgment necessary either to impress ideological purists or to forge the common ground required for legislative accomplishments. Perhaps rather than run for reelection in 2018, he might snag a federal court nomination. The prospect of bidding him farewell might induce a large majority of senators to confirm him.

This new poll helps explain why the Trump team won’t stop lying,"THE MORNING PLUM: In recent days, the Trump administration’s lies about the GOP health-care bill have reached impressive new heights of cruelty and disingenuousness. The falsehoods have focused mainly on disguising what the bill would do to Medicaid — in one way or another, they are designed to cover up the fact that Trump is eager to sign a bill that would absolutely decimate health-care spending on poor people, in violation of both the letter and spirit of his campaign promises. There’s a good explanation for all this lying buried in the new Post-ABC News poll: Large majorities say that the federal government should prioritize expanding health coverage to low-income people over cutting taxes. And this includes pretty much every core Trump voter group, too. The Post poll asked: “On health care, which of these do you think is more important for the federal government to do: provide health care coverage for low-income Americans, or cut taxes?” Americans overall picked providing health coverage to low-income Americans by 63 percent to 27 percent. And according to the crosstabs, pretty much every Trump-friendly demographic agrees: Republicans, to be sure, lean toward cutting taxes by 48-39, but that’s pretty tepid — taken all together, this suggests there are probably a lot of “soft” or reluctant Trump supporters who favor providing coverage to low-income Americans over cutting taxes. (Other polls have also found wide opposition to Medicaid cuts.) Separately, as many have already detailed, Trumpcare’s cuts to Medicaid and subsidies would directly hit a lot of the older and working-class whites who make up the Trump and GOP base. This may help explain why the Post-ABC News poll also finds that Americans favor the Affordable Care Act over the GOP replacement by 50-24. Even Trump-friendly non-college whites are divided on this by 33-33, per the crosstabs. But the question pitting expanded coverage for poor people against cutting taxes strips down the core ideological battle over the GOP bill to its essence — at bottom, it is mainly about gutting Medicaid and subsidies to lower-income people to facilitate tax cuts. Americans broadly oppose this. And it is precisely the truth that all the latest lying and dissembling from the Trump team are designed to obfuscate. Over the weekend, Vice President Pence got hammered on social media for claiming in a speech that because of the Medicaid expansion in Ohio, “nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists,” leaving them without care “for months or even years.” But as The Post pointed out, this has nothing to do with the Medicaid expansion, and the office of the state’s GOP governor, John Kasich, flatly declared that this is “the opposite of what happened.” In a related claim, Pence has been saying that the Senate GOP bill “strengthens and secures Medicaid for the neediest in our society,” which it would do, Pence asserts, by returning Medicaid to its “original purpose,” rather than covering so many “able-bodied adults.” What Pence means is that, by rolling back the expansion of Medicaid to cover that category of “able-bodied adults,” the bill would protect coverage for the most vulnerable, which the program was originally designed to cover. But as the Kaiser Family Foundation has pointed out, one of the main points of the expansion was to cover people who are working — i.e., people who are “able-bodied” — yet cannot get coverage anyway. So all Pence’s demagoguery really means is that the Senate bill would cut the ACA’s assistance to the working poor. What’s more, the Senate bill’s $772 billion in Medicaid cuts would force states to make cuts well beyond the expansion population, which, as Jonathan Cohn explains, would likely hit at least some disabled people. So the cruelty of this lie needs to be appreciated clearly: Pence is falsely claiming that the disabled in Ohio have been hurt by the ACA, to push a policy that likely would hurt the disabled. Meanwhile, in his weekly address, President Trump played down the bill’s enormous cuts to Medicaid by claiming that it “also expands the opportunity for people on Medicaid to purchase a private plan with federal financial assistance.” Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, similarly, has been preposterously saying that under the GOP bill, more people will get coverage “than are currently covered.” The suggestion here is that the cuts to Medicaid will be more than offset by the increased access to private coverage that the GOP bill will allegedly bring. Suffice it to say that the Congressional Budget Office disagrees: It found that 22 million fewer people will be covered after 10 years, 15 million of those getting knocked off the Medicaid rolls. All of this dishonesty becomes more understandable, once you see polling such as the above, which shows that large majorities fundamentally reject these priorities. Which gives rise to another question: Is it really true, as we keep hearing, that Trump and/or GOP voters will erupt in fury if this bill does not pass? As noted above, majorities of Trump voter groups oppose its core goals, and even Republican voters are tepid on them. During the campaign, we were told endlessly that Trump’s appeal in part lay precisely in his strong signaling that he was not ideologically aligned with Paul Ryan’s designs on the safety net. Now we’re told his bond with his supporters will be threatened, if he doesn’t get to sign a bill that guts the safety net in spectacularly Ryanesque fashion, including for untold numbers of Trump voters? It is often claimed that these voters don’t really care what’s in the bill; they simply want to see Trump triumphantly stomp all over something with Barack Obama’s name on it and they want Republicans to fulfill their “promise” to repeal and replace the ACA. Perhaps that’s true, but if so, this would confirm, as Brian Beutler has argued, that the only point of Trumpcare is to fulfill promises that were completely divorced from reality all along. And if, at the same time, large swaths of Trump-friendly voters don’t support its actual policy goals, this disconnect only underscores why Trump and the White House have to keep lying relentlessly about what it would really do. * ANOTHER POLL FINDS TRUMP’S NUMBERS IN THE TOILET: A new Bloomberg poll finds Trump’s approval at 40-56. His numbers on the economy are 46-44, but on immigration they’re at an abysmal 39-55, and on health care, they’re even worse, at 28-64. And: “Two-thirds don’t think he’ll succeed in building a wall along the Mexican border during his first term. More than half say he won’t be able to revive the coal industry.” So much winning! * HEALTH BILL IS DELAYED — NOW WHAT? John McCain’s surgery led GOP leaders to put the vote on the health bill on hold. Axios’ David Nather notes that this could give them more time to win over moderates. But: Every day heightens the risk that one more Senate Republican will come out against the bill … The Trump administration may be trying to convince the moderates that their concerns are being taken care of, but Senate GOP leaders may not have a lot of new arguments to make. They’ve already added $115 billion (including opioid money), and they’re reminding the moderates they can’t do much more without losing the conservatives. With the major insurance groups now denouncing the Ted Cruz amendment (which conservatives need to support the bill) as unworkable, passage looks likely to only get harder with time. * COLLINS: AS MANY AS 10 GOP SENATORS MIGHT OPPOSE HEALTH BILL: On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Susan Colllins (R-Maine) said: “This bill would impose fundamental, sweeping changes in the Medicaid program. And those include very deep cuts. That would affect some of the most vulnerable people in our society, including disabled children, poor seniors. It would affect our rural hospitals and our nursing homes … There are about eight to 10 Republican senators who have serious concerns about this bill.” A few more dollars would not meaningfully change this equation, so it’s hard to see how moderates who have expressed such concerns about this could ever support the bill. * RAND PAUL: DELAY WILL HURT HEALTH BILL’S CHANCES: Here’s what conservative Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) had to say on CBS’s “Face the Nation” about the delay in the vote: “I think the longer the bill is out there, the more conservative Republicans are going to discover that it’s not repeal.” And if GOP leaders are forced to mollify moderates by taking out the Cruz amendment — which would segment the risk pools into healthy and sick, driving up premiums for the latter and gutting protections for them — it will be even harder for conservatives to support it. * MODERATE REPUBLICANS SHOULD BAND TOGETHER: E.J. Dionne Jr. notes that history will be carefully watching how four moderate Republican senators handle their health-care vote and offers them a good suggestion: Here’s a suggestion to Dean Heller, Rob Portman, Shelley Moore Capito and Lisa Murkowski, Republican senators who should feel morally bound to vote no. Like Collins, they have spoken strongly against damaging cuts to Medicaid. If they announced their opposition together, they would lessen the political risk of standing alone and create a critical mass of GOP senators who could join Collins in her declared intention of working with Democrats “to fix flaws” in the ACA. And if they did stand against GOP efforts to roll back the ACA’s coverage expansion, we actually could have the bipartisan talks that Trump says he wants. * FROM REPUBLICANS, NONSTOP LIES ON HEALTH CARE: Paul Krugman points out that Republicans are conspicuously not openly defending their goal of rolling back health coverage for poor people: Instead, at every stage of this political fight they have claimed to be doing exactly the opposite of what they’re actually doing: covering more people, making health care cheaper, protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions. We’re not talking about run-of-the-mill spin here; we’re talking about black is white, up is down, dishonesty so raw it’s practically surreal. This isn’t just an assault on health care, it’s an assault on truth itself. It’s so weird the way these courageous ideological warriors consistently refuse to defend their actual priorities, isn’t it?

Some consistency in all the GOP health-care plans,"We have watched one Republican health-care plan after another — the original House plan, the Meadows-MacArthur amended plan, the original Senate plan and now the Cruz-amended plan. There are some constants: As to the last: The July Kaiser Health Tracking Poll finds that most Americans (61 percent) continue to hold unfavorable views of the plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including over four in ten (44 percent) who say they have “very unfavorable” view. The share of the public with negative views of the law has increased slightly in the past month, from 55 percent to 61 percent. Views of the Republican plan to repeal and replace the ACA continue to vary widely by party and a large intensity gap remains, with Democrats being nearly three times as likely to hold a “very unfavorable” view as Republicans are to hold a “very favorable” view (71 percent versus 25 percent, respectively). Nearly two-thirds of the public opposes (65 percent) major reductions in federal funding for Medicaid as part of a plan to repeal and replace the ACA, and most continue to oppose these reductions even after hearing arguments in support of them. About half of Republicans and those who approve of President Trump support major reductions in federal funding for Medicaid. . . . As seen in previous months, more of the public views the ACA favorably than the plan to replace the 2010 health care law (50 percent compared to 28 percent). Voters are telling Congress and the White House what they want. “The majority of the public (71 percent) would rather see Republicans in Congress work with Democrats to make improvements to the ACA but not repeal the law, compared to one-fourth (23 percent) who say they would rather Republicans continue working on their own plan to repeal and replace the ACA.” Although a majority of self-identified Republicans do not want bipartisan health care, “Trump supporters are divided with similar shares saying Republicans in Congress should continue working on their own plan (47 percent) as saying they want them to work with Democrats on improving the ACA (46 percent).” In short, the longer the GOP debates health care, the less appealing its plan becomes. In this regard, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had it initially right — set a quick deadline and take a vote so the GOP can move on to other things. Leaving the plan out there does not help its chances. Alas, McConnell caved to right-wing and White House pressure and now will keep working on health care through mid-August. The danger here is threefold: More debate will intensify opposition; the GOP will be less prepared to shift gears to deal with issues like the budget and debt limit in September; and the rest of the GOP’s legislative agenda will become less and less viable. On this one, McConnell should have stuck to his original game plan.

The new GOP health-care bill isn’t better or worse. It’s just more incoherent.,"The Post reports: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a new proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act on Thursday after spending three weeks reworking it to win over wavering lawmakers on the right and in the center. But within hours, it was clear that Senate leaders still didn’t have the votes to fulfill their long-standing quest to replace former president Barack Obama’s 2010 health-care law. The new draft would lift many of the ACA’s regulatory requirements, allowing insurers to offer bare-bones policies without coverage for services such as preventive or mental-health care. It would also direct billions of dollars to help lower- and middle-income Americans buy plans on the private market. However, the draft leaves in place deep proposed cuts to Medicaid — and at least three Republicans quickly signaled opposition to the bill, casting doubt on McConnell’s plans to pass the bill next week. Several important aspects of the last, final gasp of  “repeal and replace” fever on the right deserve attention — most particularly the intellectual collapse and political impotence of the GOP’s right wing. Conservative senators who inveighed against weak-kneed “establishment” leaders now favor government subsidies for health care and the requirement that insurers offer exactly the same regulated health care that Obamacare required (in addition to other options). This is the party that condemned Obamacare as a government takeover of one-sixth of the economy. So what was the GOP’s complaint about Obamacare again? Republicans now put their stamp of approval on a bill that leaves in place a system they said was a failure, not to mention an infringement on free-market principles. Likewise, the right now refuses to eliminate all Obamacare taxes, a blow to the anti-tax activists who have dominated the party for 30-plus years and a nod to progressives who for years have disparaged “reverse Robin Hood” schemes to shift wealth from the less-well-off to the rich. Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) was terse and obviously disappointed. “All Obamacare taxes should be repealed. The Trump tax reform plan, the House health bill, and the original Senate health bill abolished the Obamacare 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax,” he said in a written statement. “Given the most recent language leaves some of the taxes in place, it is important for Senate Leadership to make it clear that those taxes will be abolished in tax reform this year.” If the most zealous tax-cutters now accept a bill that leaves hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes in place, what exactly does the GOP stand for when it comes to taxes? Since Republicans have acknowledged the unseemliness of big tax cuts for the rich, one wonders how they plan on justifying even bigger cuts as part of a tax reform plan. At its core, the GOP’s bastardized system — keeping Obamacare-style plans in place but adding cheaper plans with higher deductibles — defies logic and solves no particular problem. Voters said Obamacare deductibles were too high. This latest proposal continues those plans (minus the individual mandate, a move that will increase adverse selection) and adds in even higher-deductible plans. It does not halt the adverse selection/death-spiral problem in the exchanges; it accelerates it. (“Critics, including insurers, say that providing the option of skimpier plans would draw younger, healthier consumers into a separate risk pool. That development would drive up rates for the Americans buying more-comprehensive coverage on the individual market, which could in turn destabilize the entire market.”) This “solution” solves nothing, but rather underscores and accentuates the affordability problem, about which Republicans cried buckets of crocodile tears for more than seven years. The entire health-care escapade confirms what many figured out long ago — Republicans’ interest in and affinity for health-care policy is minimal. The Cato Institute’s Michael Cannon sneers at the pseudo-choice amendment embraced by some conservatives: This draft imposes ObamaCare’s “single risk pool” price controls on “freedom option” plans. Long story short, that means there is no “freedom option” in this bill. Insurers probably would not even offer non-compliant plans. If they did, ObamaCare’s “single risk pool” price controls would make secure, guaranteed-renewable health insurance impossible by taxing such plans to death. . . . The “single risk pool” price controls would require insurers to increase premiums for both both ObamaCare-compliant plans and non-compliant plans by the same percentage. If claims in the complaint market necessitate a 10 [percent] increase, while claims in the non-compliant market necessitate only a 6 percent increase, the insurer would have to increase premiums in the former market by too little and/or increase premiums in the latter market by too much. As a political matter, the latest version of Trumpcare cannot draw enough support from moderates, who still object to massive cuts in Medicaid and a plan that forces older, sicker Americans to pay more. The bill leaves supposedly staunch conservatives, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), in the position of advocating for a pseudo-Obamacare plan — and right-wing interest groups (e.g., ATR, Heritage Action) trying to justify concessions (or else criticizing the handiwork of its pets, such as Cruz). The effort makes House Republicans who voted for a prior, crueler and more regressive version of the bill look especially foolish and craven. The biggest loser in all this may be House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who forced members to walk the plank for horrid legislation that would never pass the Senate. The common thread running through all of this is utter, acute intellectual incoherence. The bill leaves in place enough of the Affordable Care Act to make hypocrites of many prominent leaders and to disgrace chest-thumping conservatives. The bill suggests Republicans have no real policy objective here, other than wanting to eviscerate the handiwork of the eponymous author. They are reduced to pure posturing and blame-shifting. Instead of replacing Obamacare with something better, the GOP is now dedicated to replacing it with anything, no matter how bad, because it said it promised to get rid of President Barack Obama’s signature achievement. This vividly captures the split between, on one hand, Republicans who care about solving problems (Sens. Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski, Shelley Moore Capito, Susan Collins) and, on the other, Republicans who are slaves to sloganeering and who are convinced that rural, less-educated voters are unsophisticated rubes who can be bamboozled by talk radio, Fox News hosts and White House lies. The few on the far right, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who have actual principles– albeit ones we don’t agree with — are revealed to be far fewer in number than their rhetorical volume suggests. The good news for the country and the center right may be that the Portman/Murkowski/Collins/Capito wing of the party may be the only part of the GOP to survive with its moral and intellectual credibility intact. The bad news is that it is still badly outnumbered by the intellectually vacant, crass operators who have demonstrated no capacity for governance. Perhaps in finding common ground with Democrats to fix Obamacare, the moderate/problem-solving wing can redeem the party and reshuffle the political landscape; if not, its members at least sleep at night knowing that they were not responsible for the demise of a once-serious party.

"The Daily 202: Trump’s children become bigger liabilities for the White House, complicate damage-control efforts","With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: You can’t fire family. A voter asked Hillary Clinton during one of the debates last October to say something positive about Donald Trump. Amid an especially nasty campaign — when her opponent was encouraging chants of “lock her up” during his rallies — she didn’t hesitate. “I respect his children,” the former secretary of state said. “His children are incredibly able and devoted and I think that says a lot about Donald.” Clinton certainly wouldn’t give that answer anymore, especially after what’s transpired this week. Trump yesterday defended Donald Jr.’s sit-down with a Russian attorney during last year’s campaign, saying “zero” improprieties occurred and “most people would have taken” the meeting. “He's a good boy,” the president said during a gaggle on Air Force One. “He's a good kid.” “My son is a wonderful young man,” the president added during a news conference in Paris. In fact, Don Jr. is 39. He’s the same age as the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, who was standing next to Trump when he said that. Both kids/boys/young men — whatever he wants to call them — were born in 1977. Don Jr. pulled his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, who is 36, into a meeting with someone he was told had dirt on Clinton from the Russian government. Then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who is 68, also attended. A youthful indiscretion this was not. It’s also a reminder that you don’t have to be young to be stupid. Perhaps most importantly, though, Trump’s spirited defense offered a window into how much more complex dealing with the Russia scandal is for the White House when multiple members of the president’s family are now implicated. -- Trump’s embrace of a kind of nepotism that’s historically been more common in banana republics than the first world continues to backfire on him — creating a myriad of legal and political headaches. And they’re probably only going to get worse. -- Trump has no problem shunting aside staff when he concludes that they’ve outlived their usefulness to him or become more trouble than they’re worth. In addition to Manafort, there’s a cast of characters from Sam Nunberg to Corey Lewandowski, Carter Page and Michael Flynn. Other fall guys have been left in Trump’s wake, especially if you broaden your time horizon to include the casinos he drove into bankruptcy and his many other failures in business. Remember when White House press secretary Sean Spicer ludicrously claimed that Manafort, who ran the campaign for months, “played a very limited role for a very limited period of time”? Or when Sean insisted that Flynn, the former national security adviser, was merely a “volunteer of the campaign”? But, as The Fix’s Aaron Blake notes, “Disowning or minimizing his own family isn't really an option for Trump.” -- Most White House aides are trying to protect the principal: the president and, really, the presidency itself. But Trump himself seems focused primarily on protecting his personal interests, which includes his family. He was reportedly involved in the preparation of Don Jr.’s initial, misleading statement to the New York Times, which claimed the meeting with the Russian lawyer was about adoption. The personal and the political have come into conflict quite a lot over the past week, and by all indications they will continue to. -- This has exasperated Republicans on Capitol Hill. Rep. Bill Flores (R-Tex.) said on-the-record what many feel privately when he told the Texas CBS affiliate KBT: “I'm going out on a limb here, but I would say that I think it would be in the president's best interest if he removed all of his children from the White House. Not only Donald Trump, but Ivanka and Jared Kushner.” -- The president’s shifting version of events continues to unravel in other ways. Trump has maintained that he was unaware of his eldest son’s June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer until right before the New York Times broke the story. He said on Wednesday night that he “just heard about it two or three days ago.” Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff now reports that Marc Kasowitz, Trump’s personal attorney, and Alan Garten, the top lawyer for the Trump Organization, were both informed about the emails three weeks ago by Kushner’s legal team. “The discovery of the emails prompted Kushner to amend his security clearance form to reflect the meeting, which he had failed to report when he originally sought [his security clearance],” Isikoff writes. “That revision — his second — to the so-called SF-86, was done on June 21. The change to the security form prompted the FBI to question Kushner on June 23, the second time he was interviewed by agents about his security clearance … But the information that Trump’s lawyers were told about the emails in June raises questions about why they would not have immediately informed the president. Pushing back the discovery of the emails to the third week in June also raises additional questions about the initial public statements made by the White House after the existence of the meeting was first reported.” Marc E. Kasowitz, personal attorney for Donald Trump, addresses the media following the testimony of former F.B.I. Director James Comey last month. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) -- Kasowitz has labored to underscore the potential risk to the president if he engages without a lawyer in discussions with other people under scrutiny in the investigation, including Kushner. Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker and Devlin Barrett have some fantastic reporting this morning on the growing tensions behind the scenes: “Nearly two months after Trump retained outside counsel to represent him in the investigations of alleged Russian meddling in last year’s election, his and Kushner’s attorneys are struggling to enforce traditional legal boundaries to protect their clients, according to half a dozen people with knowledge of the internal dynamics and ongoing interactions … A third faction could complicate the dynamic further. Trump’s eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., hired his own criminal defense attorney this week … Trump Jr. also is considering hiring his own outside public relations team. … “The challenge for President Trump’s attorneys has become, at its core, managing the unmanageable — their client. He won’t follow instructions. After one meeting in which they urged Trump to steer clear of a certain topic, he sent a tweet about that very theme before they arrived back at their office. He won’t compartmentalize. With aides, advisers and friends breezing in and out of the Oval Office, it is not uncommon for the president to suddenly turn the conversation to Russia — a subject that perpetually gnaws at him — in a meeting about something else entirely. … Senior White House officials are increasingly reluctant to discuss the issue internally or publicly and worry about overhearing sensitive conversations, for fear of legal exposure. … As in Trump’s West Wing, lawyers on the outside teams have been deeply distrustful of one another and suspicious of motivations. They also are engaged in a circular firing squad of private speculation about who may have disclosed information about Trump Jr.’s meeting…” Trump, for his part, is also now trying to force the Republican Party to pick up his legal tab. Another scoop from Phil, Ashley and Devlin’s story: “Some in Trump’s orbit are pushing the Republican National Committee to bear the costs … Although the RNC does have a legal defense fund, it well predates the Russia investigations and is intended to be used for legal challenges facing the Republican Party, such as a potential election recount. The RNC has not made a decision, in part because the committee is still researching whether the money could legally be used to help pay legal costs related to Russia. But many within the organization are resisting the effort, thinking it would be more appropriate to create a separate legal defense fund for the case. … The White House has not said whether Trump, Kushner and other officials are paying their legal bills themselves or whether they are being covered by an outside entity.” -- Kasowitz, who is clearly under heavy strain, lashed out at a random stranger who criticized him in an email on Wednesday – firing off a blizzard of threatening, profanity-laced responses.  ProPublica’s Justin Elliott got the emails. Trump speaks to Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon at the White House. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) -- Because of the nature of their work inside the White House, the president’s daughter and son-in-law pose a unique set of additional problems. Kushner has been pushing internally this week for a more aggressive defense of Trump Jr.’s meeting, which he also attended, but he has faced resistance from some of Trump’s top press aides. Sources tell Politico’s Tara Palmeri that “Kushner wants the White House to more aggressively push out surrogates and talking points to change the narrative … But some of the communications aides, including [Spicer] … have expressed reservations. They say it’s best to leave it to outside counsel to handle the furor around Trump Jr., and fear inviting further legal jeopardy if Trump aides and allies more forcefully defend a meeting that they don’t fully know the details of. …  After hours of little defense from the White House on Tuesday following Trump Jr.’s release of the email chain … Kushner spoke with Spicer and [Sarah] Huckabee Sanders. During the conversation, Spicer and Sanders made the case for crafting a longer-term battle strategy … but Kushner called for full-on combat.” Remember, The Post reported back in May that Kushner was already a focal point of the Russia investigation. He met last December with Russia's ambassador to the United States and a banker with ties to the Kremlin. The Post has also reported that Sergey Kislyak told Moscow that Kushner floated the idea of a secret communications channel — or back channel — with Moscow. “Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have tried their best to soar gracefully above the raging dumpster fire that is the Trump administration. Unhappily for the handsome couple, gravity makes no allowances for charm,” Eugene Robinson quips in his column for today’s paper. “Kushner, already reported to be a ‘person of interest’ in the Justice Department probe of President Trump’s campaign, is arguably the individual with the most to lose from the revelation that the campaign did, after all, at least attempt to collude with the Russian government to boost Trump’s chances of winning the election. … Jared and Ivanka have first-class educations. They know how the Icarus story ends.” Kushner’s own business interests exposes the White House in other ways, as well. One of the most under-covered stories this week came from The Intercept: “Not long before a major crisis ripped through the Middle East, pitting the United States and a bloc of Gulf countries against Qatar, Jared Kushner’s real estate company had unsuccessfully sought a critical half-billion-dollar [bailout] from one of the richest and most influential men in the tiny nation … Kushner is a senior adviser to President Trump … and also the scion of a New York real estate empire that faces an extreme risk from an investment made by Kushner in the building at 666 Fifth Avenue, where the family is now severely underwater.” -- Don Jr. is on the cover of next week’s Time Magazine. It’s not one that will get framed and hung in Trump Tower. The Atlantic’s Molly Ball explains that Don Jr. has always been “The Troublemaker”: “Many years ago, when his eldest son was still a boy, Donald Trump was interviewed by Barbara Walters, along with his family. Which child, she asked ... did he consider the troublemaker in the family? Trump didn’t hesitate for a moment. ‘Don,’ he shot back … An angry and petulant youth, he actually didn’t fully buy into Trumphood until after college ... [and] at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, Don was known mostly for drinking and picking fights. Brash, strong-willed, risk-taking: These qualities made Don Jr. the most visible of the Trump children during the campaign. But this week’s revelations … cast those same qualities in a different light … Once again, Don Jr. is his father’s troublemaker, but this time the trouble is much more than fun and games. On Wednesday, I texted Don and asked how he was doing. ‘Fantastic,’ he wrote back—followed by the ‘laughing crying’ emoji. He declined to comment further.” -- Speaking of progeny: Ronald Reagan’s daughter, Patti Davis, has written a post on her blog entitled “THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING.” The former first daughter expresses alarm: “One man, whose arrogance and ego lead him trippingly into chaos of his own making, can turn a shining city on the hill into a shadowy, taudry replica of itself. … If he was quiet for five minutes he might hear the echo of (Vladimir) Putin’s laughter carried on the wind across countries and oceans. But Trump’s ego is a loud, boisterous thing and will never allow him to hear anything that might cause him to reflect. … Our democracy, and the dignity of America, is wounded and bleeding out. It doesn’t mean that it can’t be restored and healed, but not by this administration. And it will only get worse if those intent on making excuses continue saying that Trump and his extended family are new at this governing thing, and are just bumbling a bit.” Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner listen at the Lincoln Memorial during a pre-Inaugural concert. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) IF YOU READ ONE STORY TODAY: -- Ivanka’s business practices collide with several of the key principles that she and her father purport to champion in the White House. An investigative report by Matea Gold, Drew Harwell, Maher Sattar and Simon Denyer went live at 6 a.m.: “While President Trump has chastised companies for outsourcing jobs overseas, an examination by The Washington Post has revealed the extent to which Ivanka Trump’s (clothing) company relies exclusively on foreign factories … where low-wage laborers have limited ability to advocate for themselves. And while Ivanka Trump published a book this spring declaring that improving the lives of working women was ‘my life’s mission,’ The Post found that her company lags behind many in the apparel industry when it comes to monitoring the treatment of the largely female workforce employed in factories around the world… “In China, where three activists investigating factories making her line were recently arrested, assembly-line workers produce Ivanka Trump woven blouses, shoes and handbags. Laborers in Indonesia stitch together her dresses and knit tops. Suit jackets are assembled in Vietnam, cotton tops in India and denim pants in Bangladesh … And in Ethiopia, where manufacturers have boasted of paying workers a fifth of what they earn in Chinese factories, workers made … Ivanka Trump-brand shoes … “Trump [who last weekend sat in her for her father during a meeting at the G-20] still owns her company … Her attorney Jamie Gorelick told The Post in a statement that Trump is ‘concerned’ about recent reports regarding the treatment of factory workers and ‘expects that the company will respond appropriately.’ … The company still has no immediate plans to follow the emerging industry trend of publishing the names and locations of factories that produce its goods.” Her line also declined to disclose the language of a code of conduct that it claims prohibits physical abuse and child labor. “The Post used data drawn from U.S. customs logs and international shipping records to trace Trump-branded products from far-flung factories to ports around the United States. The Post also interviewed workers at three garment factories that have made Trump products who said their jobs often come with exhausting hours, subsistence pay and insults from supervisors if they don’t work fast enough. … ‘My monthly salary is not enough for everyday expenses, also not for the future,’ said a 26-year-old sewing operator in Subang, Indonesia, who said she has helped make Trump dresses. The 4,800-word piece by my colleagues, which includes a lot of quotes like that, is well worth your time. Dogged, on-the-ground reporting vividly illustrates how sharply at odds Ivanka’s rhetoric is with the reality of how she’s done business. Here is one especially memorable vignette: “Financial insecurity is a constant companion for the predominantly female workforce at PT Buma, a factory in Indonesia’s West Java province that produced a batch of Ivanka-branded knit dresses … K., a 26-year-old sewing-machine operator, told The Post that she makes the equivalent of $173 a month, the region’s minimum wage. … She said she spends $23 to rent her small studio in the bustling factory town of Subang, where she sleeps on a mattress on the floor and hangs her clothes from a string hung along the wall. She saves the rest for her 2-year-old daughter but worries she will not be able to afford elementary school fees, which can cost as much as $225 a year. With no child care, K. is forced to leave the toddler at home with her parents in their village, a journey of about 90 minutes away by motorbike across the rice fields. On the weekend, she joins an exodus of parents from Subang who clamber onto motorbikes and into shared vans, racing home for brief reunions. ‘I really miss the moments when we play together,’ K. said. … For K., the dresses she has helped produce — which retail for as much as $138 — seem as out of reach as the daughter of the U.S. president herself…” All the labels on Ivanka Trump’s newest denim collection, showcased at Lord & Taylor, brandish her #WomenWhoWork slogan: “The labels on the jeans (also) show they were made for G-III Apparel in Bangladesh, whose garment industry has weathered a series of deadly factory disasters, including a 2013 building collapse that killed more than 1,100 workers. In its wake, Disney pulled its production out of the country, and brands such as Walmart and Gap said they paid for safety training for factory managers. Shipping records do not reveal which factories in the country produce Ivanka Trump goods, and both the brand and G-III refused to say … Along with facing safety risks, Bangladeshi garment workers toil for one of the world’s lowest minimum wages. ‘We are the ultra-poor,’ said Kalpona Akter, a Bangladeshi labor organizer and former garment worker who was first hired by a factory at the age of 12. ‘We are making you beautiful, but we are starving.’ “In December, thousands of workers seeking higher pay went on strike outside Dhaka (the capital city). In response, police rounded up and arrested several dozen labor organizers, and factory owners filed criminal complaints against hundreds of workers … An estimated 1,500 garment workers were suspended or fired. … A number of apparel brands have called on factories to halt the worker crackdown. ... Trump’s brand and G-III have not publicly addressed (it). … In recent years, hundreds of clothing lines and manufacturers have poured millions into financing safety improvements in garment factories through two major initiatives … Neither Trump’s company nor G-III Apparel has contributed to those efforts.” (Read the full story here.)

During short lulls, Trump would pull Macron in for a conversation … The president was largely shielded from any dissent and from a ‘Don’t Let Your Guard Down Against Trump’ protest march that started more than a mile away from where he sat.” -- Overruling the Trump administration, a federal judge in Hawaii ruled that grandparents should be exempt from the travel ban. Samantha Schmidt reports: “U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson ruled Thursday night that the federal government’s list of family relatives eligible to bypass the travel ban should be expanded to include grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts and other relatives. Watson also ordered exemptions for refugees who have been given formal assurance from agencies placing them in the United States. In Watson’s ruling, he said the government’s definition of what constitutes close family ‘represents the antithesis of common sense.’ ‘Common sense, for instance, dictates that close family members be defined to include grandparents,’ Watson wrote. ‘Indeed, grandparents are the epitome of close family members. The Government’s definition excludes them. That simply cannot be.’” GET SMART FAST:​​ Nobel Peace Prize winner and Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo died at 61.

Sean Sullivan, Juliet Eilperin and Kelsey Snell report: “But within hours, it was clear that Senate leaders still didn’t have the votes to fulfill their long-standing quest to replace former president Barack Obama’s 2010 health-care law … At least three Republicans quickly signaled opposition to the bill, casting doubt on McConnell’s plans to pass the bill next week … Moderate Republicans remained concerned Thursday that the new proposal would make insurance unaffordable for some ­middle-income Americans and throw millions off the rolls of Medicaid ... Yet conservatives continued to push for a more wholesale rollback of the ACA — highlighting the danger for all Republicans of failing to achieve a promise most of them made on the campaign trail.” The new draft keeps much of the original’s core architecture, including deep cuts to Medicaid, along with some additional funding for moderate Republicans’ projects: Just before McConnell released his bill, GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy (La.) and Lindsey Graham (S.C.) took to CNN to announce their own separate plan: “Cassidy and Graham said they would take the billions of dollars the federal government now receives in taxes under the ACA and direct that revenue to the states. The plan did not appear to be gaining traction — Graham said he would vote to start debate on McConnell’s bill — but its introduction underscored the extent to which a growing number of GOP senators have started looking beyond the current effort, with diminishing confidence that it will prevail.” -- As expected, two of the 'No' votes are moderate Sen. Susan Collins and conservative Sen. Rand Paul, who both said they would oppose the motion to proceed with McConnell’s new draft. Seven other Republican senators have indicated at least “concern” about the proposed legislation. (Amber Phillips has been taking point on our up-to-date whip count.) -- To understand Republicans' dilemma, look no further than Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Paul Kane writes: “The Coloradan, a rising star who defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2014, leads the campaign committee responsible for protecting and expanding the GOP majority … But he has remained below the radar, both back home and inside the Capitol, declining to take a position on legislation that would replace portions of the Affordable Care Act. For starters, he has home-state interests that make this one of the more difficult roll calls of his career … Gardner also has to concern himself with his own reelection in 2020, a presidential cycle with a political climate different from that of his first Senate race in one of the nation’s marquee swing states, when he campaigned heavily for ‘repeal and replace.’ -- Trump urged Republicans to pass their bill"
"Look past the smoke from the Trump White House funeral pyre, and you’ll see financial Armageddon","There is so much smoke from the funeral pyre that is President Trump’s White House, its ties to Russia and the fool’s errand that is the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare that you’d be forgiven for not seeing the cliff over which the United States is about to plunge. Yep, I’m resuming my role as town crier about the debt ceiling because all this mind-boggling stuff we’re talking about now (Donald Trump Jr.’s emails?!) will pale in comparison to the financial Armageddon that awaits us if our fiscal car pulls a “Thelma and Louise.” You might remember that at a congressional hearing on May 24, when asked when the debt ceiling would have to be raised to avoid default, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney went all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ and said that it was his understanding that “the receipts, currently, are coming in a little bit slower than expected.” Tax receipts, that is, which means the treasury, already employing “extraordinary measures” to keep below the legal limit on federal borrowing, has less cash on hand to tread water until Congress gets around to raising that limit. [‘Category 5 hurricane’: White House under siege by Trump Jr.’s Russia revelations] That’s significant because of three things that happened on June 30. First, the Congressional Budget Office issued a report that warned that if the debt ceiling isn’t raised the federal government will “most likely” not have enough cash on hand to pay all of its bills in “early to mid-October.” Second, in response, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the White House, “For the benefit of everybody, the sooner that they do this the better.” Third, 10 Republican senators sent an urgent letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), warning that after they return from the July 4 recess that there are “only 33 potential working days remaining before the end of the fiscal year.” That calculation is probably different now that McConnell has shrunk the August recess. But with every waking moment spent on getting Trumpcare out of the Senate, you can pretty much guarantee no real movement on raising the debt ceiling. Oh, did you forget there is a fiscal year 2018 budget that needs to get done before the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1? The Bipartisan Policy Center estimated last March that sometime between October and November, the U.S. treasury might not have enough cash on hand to meet all of its financial obligations. That’s what it calls the “X date.” Well, on Wednesday, the nonprofit that lives up to its name revised its prediction. “There is currently significant evidence to support an ‘X Date’ within the early to mid-October period,” the BPC announced. And this squares right up with what the CBO reported late last month. Early October is not only critical because it is the start of a new budget year. Specifically, on Oct. 2, as the BPC has been pointing out for months, Treasury must pump money into the Military Retirement Trust Fund. That payment was $81 billion in 2016. The federal government not having enough money on hand to pay all of its bills on time would destroy the full faith and credit of the United States and throttle the American people in ways unimaginable. “When we’re talking about the payments that the government makes, these are to every American individual out there,” Shai Akabas, director of fiscal policy at BPC, said on a call with reporters on Wednesday. “Almost every single person gets some payment from either directly or indirectly from the federal government. So, whether, it’s Social Security beneficiaries, doctors who provide Medicare and Medicaid and the patients that they rely on them, welfare recipients … federal employees. These are all people who are waiting for payments from the government and people are waiting, then, in turn for payments from those people or businesses because the economy is obviously very dynamic and relies on each payment going before the next payment.” [The OMG moment at a congressional budget hearing you should care about but don’t — yet] As we get closer to that X date and the hysteria builds, you’re going to hear Republican lawmakers say there’s nothing to worry about because as long as the treasury makes the legally mandated interest payments, the United States won’t be in financial default in the eyes of credit-rating agencies and the global markets. Don’t buy it. Remember, the credit rating of the U.S. was downgraded for the first time in history when we went through the debt-ceiling crisis in 2011. Akabas allows that those folks are technically correct. “My sense is that the credit-rating agencies’ people who evaluate technical default do actually draw distinctions between missing other payments that the government owes and actually missing a payment to bondholders because that’s effectively what the credit rating is. It is the credit of how likely you are to make your payments to bondholders.” Then he added this: “But in terms of what the perception would be, which is, I think, just as important, if the federal government, which is considered the most creditworthy entity on the planet, is missing payments that is owed on a large scale to either individuals or businesses, even if they are continuing to make all payments to bondholders, then I think you will see consequences that we can’t foretell right now.” [Debt limit: Myth v. Fact] Akabas said he doesn’t think that “we will ever be in a position where policymakers who are entrusted with the responsibility of the full faith and credit of the United States will desire to default on our debt.” Still, he had an implicit warning for lawmakers: But they could, either through their actions or lack of action, put us in a position where things spiral out of their control and then they’re not the ones who are determining whether or not we are defaulting on either our obligation or our debt. And so I would expect that if the federal government starts missing payments, we will see ramifications, whether it’s in the financial markets, whether it’s in terms of the general public or otherwise that are unanticipated, and that will cause, again, a lot of concern among folks who are responsible for these matters.

The Health 202: There's at least one tax that Republicans appear to like,"THE PROGNOSIS Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.)arrive for weekly policy meetings on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) It was a close call, but an Obamacare tax paid chiefly by the country’s richest individuals just might survive even as Senate Republicans try to slash other pieces of the Affordable Care Act. Why? The tax on investments is just too lucrative, for one thing. Repealing it is too politically dangerous, for another. And there are no big, powerful health-care lobbies hammering away at it, either. Senators emerging from a huddle yesterday over changes to their health-care bill named the ACA’s tax on investment income as a part of the health-care law they might keep, after all, even though the bill’s original version would wipe it out. Several individuals familiar with GOP leaders’ thinking said this idea is under active consideration, my colleagues Kelsey Snell, Sean Sullivan and Juliet Eilperin report. The move would hardly be surprising, from both a policy and a political perspective. The net investment income tax is projected to bring the federal government $172.2 billion over the next decade, meaning it is Obamacare’s biggest revenue raiser by far. That money would basically double the funding available to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to make the bill more generous to low-income Americans, changes that moderates are demanding before they’d even consider voting for the troubled legislation. Word on the street is that McConnell is intent on improving estimates of insurance coverage for his bill, most likely by beefing up its insurance subsidies and giving insurers more money to cover their most expensive, sickest patients. If he can achieve better estimates of how many people the bill would cover then the bill could be less politically painful to support and help the Kentucky Republican pass it when the voting is slated to start next week. Speaking of politics, Republicans could also achieve something useful by keeping around the investment income tax. They’d kill one of Democrats’ single best attack lines against the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. The tax, which collects a 3.8 percent levy on a couple’s investment income above $250,000, is overwhelmingly paid by not just the richest Americans, but the richest of the richest Americans. (My colleague Max Ehrenfreund explains more here about how the Senate GOP will would treat the richest versus poorest Americans.) Repealing it would restore 2.6 percent of the after-tax income for the top 0.1 percent of earners (those making more than $3.9 million) and 2.1 percent of income for the top 1 percent – but just 0.5 percent of the income of middle-income households, according to research by the Urban Institute. Couple that with the fact that the Senate GOP bill would significantly roll back federal Medicaid dollars and subsidies helping to cover low-income people, and the optics of such a move would be pretty awful for Republicans -- and pretty great for Democrats. The latter has been framing the health-care bill for weeks now as a tax giveaway to the rich at the expense of the working poor.  From Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): A great nation is not judged its number of billionaires or the tax breaks they get. It's judged by how we treat the most vulnerable. And Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.): Tax cuts for 400 wealthy families is equivalent to the Medicaid expansion for 700,000 Americans. Keep up the calls.https://t.co/9cxk1X8lk7 And here’s another big reason the investment income tax could be a keeper, even for conservatives who most want to root out Obamacare: It doesn’t have many opponents, including in the powerful health-care industry world. Health insurers focused their mighty forces on pressuring lawmakers to repeal the ACA’s health insurance tax, known as HIT, and its so-called “Cadillac tax” on high-cost health plans. They somewhat succeeded, as Congress has delayed both levies. The Cadillac tax is now set to take effect in 2020, instead of 2018, and the HIT tax won’t kick in until January even though it was scheduled for this year. Those taxes, which insurers argue would force them to hike premiums even more, are likely to still be repealed in the modified bill McConnell says he'll roll out on Thursday. John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican, spun it this way to Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur: Barrasso on revised Senate Trumpcare: The taxes that will be repealed are all the taxes that have been driving up the cost of insurance."" A few conservative-leaning groups do want to see the investment income tax die. Two of them are the Americans for Tax Reform and the National Federation of Independent Businesses"
McConnell may be about to break a crucial GOP promise on Obamacare,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R.-Ky.) faces a tough decision on what to do with the tax increases that were put in place by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, a decision that will have major implications not only for the GOP repeal effort, but for Republicans' next major legislative push. Last month, McConnell tried to advance a bill that would have cut future revenues by $700 billion over 10 years by eliminating a number of tax provisions in the ACA. This included a $172.2 billion cut over 10 years by repealing the “net investment tax” and another $58.6 billion by repealing the Medicare Tax Increase. Both of those tax cuts would primarily benefit wealthier Americans. The 3.8 percent net investment tax applied to capital gains and other investments for individuals making more than $200,000 in annual income or married couples making more than $250,000. The Medicare Tax Increase added a 0.9 percent tax increase for people in the same income threshold. That bill faltered in the Senate, as Republican support splintered. A number of GOP lawmakers said that they should not cut taxes in a way that benefits wealthy Americans while voting on a bill that would cut benefits for the poor. Now McConnell faces several options: "
Ted Cruz’s health-care plan works great unless you need health care,"Republicans have come up with a new twist on their health-care plan that would make premiums cheaper for healthy people but prohibitively expensive for upper-middle-class people with preexisting conditions. I guess that counts as progress? The proposal, the brainchild of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), would let health insurers offer plans that don't follow Obamacare's rules as long as they offer one that does. Which is to say that they'd once again be free to not only sell skimpy plans that didn't cover things like mental health or maternity care or prescription drugs, but also charge people with preexisting conditions more for them — if they didn't just deny them outright. This is a small idea that would have big consequences. That's because letting insurance companies sell plans that only healthy people could buy would mean it wouldn't be long until those were the only ones healthy people did buy — at which point sick people would be left having to pay more than they could afford. Think about it like this. The simple fact that, given the choice, many healthy people would pick bare-bones plans over more comprehensive (and costlier) options would set off a chain reaction in the rest of the insurance market. The prices of those more extensive plans would go up a lot since not enough healthy people had signed up for them, and the healthy people who had done so would drop their coverage since it had gotten so much more expensive — which, you guessed it, would make prices shoot up even more, until eventually there were only sick people left. The health insurance market, in other words, would split into two. Healthy people would buy plans that wouldn't actually cover much, and sick people would try to buy plans that would actually cover them. And as long as they weren't getting paid too much, they could do that. The Senate bill, you see, gives people making 350 percent of the poverty line or less —$42,210 for individuals, or $86,100 for a family of four — the same kind of subsidies Obamacare does that automatically go up as premiums do. So the people who got them would be insulated from what would otherwise be the unaffordable increases the Cruz plan would cause. Despite that, though, people with preexisting conditions would still be considerably worse off under the Republican plan than they are under Obamacare. Why is that? Well, the people who did get subsidies would only be able to buy plans they couldn't really afford to use, and the ones who didn't wouldn't be able to buy any kind of plans, period. There are two stories here. The first is that the Senate bill would peg the value of its subsidies to much cheaper plans than Obamacare does, so a lot of people would be pushed into higher-deductible ones that, as far they're concerned, might as well be none at all. Indeed, in the case of someone making $18,090 or less, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that their deductible would go from an average of $255 under Obamacare to $6,105 under the Senate bill. The second is that it would make the cost of comprehensive plans skyrocket so much that nobody would be able to afford them without government help. This would be a big difference from the way things are now. For all of President Trump's talk about Obamacare alternatively “imploding” or “exploding” or entering a “death spiral,” his own administration has concluded that this is not the case. Insurance markets are mostly stable. And since people with preexisting conditions aren't shunted off on their own, their premiums haven't gone up more than everybody else's. It might not be easy, but for individuals making more than $48,240, or families of four making more than $98,400 — that's how high Obamacare's subsidies go — it is possible, for the most part, to get covered regardless of their health status. But the Cruz plan, as we've said before, would change that. Sick people would be segregated into what would be de facto high-risk pools, and, as a result, their premiums would soar into the financial stratosphere. Compounding that is the fact that the Senate bill would only offer subsidies up to 350 percent of the poverty level instead of the 400 percent that Obamacare does. Anyone making more than this new lower level would be out of luck, and out of the health insurance market. That means if you had acne or diabetes or were pregnant — all preexisting conditions that insurers could use to discriminate against you under the Cruz plan — you'd be better off making $42,210 than $42,211, since that extra dollar would cost you thousands in subsidies. The Republican plan, then, would make it so sick people couldn't buy insurance without subsidies at the same time that it cut the value of those subsidies and took them away from some middle-class people. This is really only about one thing: redistributing money from the poor and sick to the rich and healthy. And that's not just what liberals are saying. Conservatives are too. James Capretta, a former Bush administration official who is now a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, says that “the main effect” of Cruz's plan “would be to shift costs from healthy consumers to less-healthy consumers and household with lower incomes.” Freedom, ain't it grand!

"The Daily 202: Email to Donald Trump Jr. could be a smoking gun, as Russia connections deepen","With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: There is a paper trail. Last night, the New York Times reported: “Before arranging a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer he believed would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father’s candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of the email. The email to the younger Mr. Trump was sent by Rob Goldstone, a publicist and former British tabloid reporter who helped broker the June 2016 meeting. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he was interested in receiving damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, but gave no indication that he thought the lawyer might have been a Kremlin proxy. Mr. Goldstone’s message, as described to The New York Times by the three people, indicates that the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information. New details from others involved in arranging the meeting point to additional Trump links to Moscow. Our Rosalind S. Helderman"
One hint that the GOP is struggling on health care: Democrats tweet about it a lot more,"The only bill that might be more unpopular than the Senate Republicans’ proposal to overhaul the health-care system is the one passed by House Republicans earlier this year. That legislation, a recent analysis determined, is the least popular piece of legislation in at least 30 years — far less popular at passage than the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which it hopes to supplant. It is not clear how much of that unpopularity stems from the unpopularity of the president who’s halfheartedly championing it. But President Trump is unpopular and he supports the bill and the bill is unpopular, so it’s safe to assume there’s some overlap happening somewhere in that mix. It seems pretty clear, given all of those unpopular elements, that many Republicans on Capitol Hill are not excited to be talking about the issue. And, thanks to a tool from writer and developer Alex Litel that compiles congressional tweets every day, we can see that lack of excitement in real terms. The calculus is simple. If an issue benefits one party more than the other, that party will try to bring it up more often. And in tweets since June 27 (when Litel’s tool began compiling data), Democrats in the House and Senate have talked about health care (or “healthcare”) at a much higher percentage than Republicans have.  What’s more, Democrats also often use the term “Trumpcare,” meant as a pejorative that links the health-care policy to the unpopular president.  By contrast, references to “Obamacare” are relatively rare. Republicans once used the term the way Democrats now use “Trumpcare,” but it seems like the effectiveness of doing so may have waned.  Here’s another way of looking at those numbers. The circles below are scaled to the percentage of tweets containing each term on the left. Democrats consistently tweeted the words “health care” more than Republicans did, with that lull at the Fourth of July.  If we break that data out by chamber, we learn a bit more. Democrats on both sides of the Capitol tweet about health care more than Republicans, but House Democrats have done so much more than House Republicans.  Over the June 27 to July 9 period, Democrats sent nearly 10,300 tweets while Republicans sent around 6,800. Twelve percent of the tweets from Democrats mentioned health care (including 20 percent of those from Democratic senators) while only 3.5 percent of the tweets from Republicans did the same (including 6.5 percent of Republican senators).  That suggests that one party wants to talk about the issue more than the other. Which suggests further that it sees a political advantage in doing so. Polling suggests there’s good reason for Democrats to think that. "
The GOP tried to troll Hillary Clinton. It backfired spectacularly.,"For those about to troll, Hillary Clinton salutes you. With policy. Defending the GOP's plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the Republican National Committee sent several tweets Wednesday criticizing key senators — plus the Clintons — for their lack of support. “Our health care system is collapsing, but Democrats refuse to bring anything to the table. Where’s THEIR plan?” @GOP posted Wednesday, showing clips from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former president Bill Clinton acknowledging issues with the health-care system. The GOP then took a shot at Hillary Clinton, the vanquished 2016 presidential contender. “We’ve got to fix what’s broken.” Where's your plan, @HillaryClinton? pic.twitter.com/CmRB4mCsZd — GOP (@GOP) July 5, 2017  Hours later, Clinton fired back, tweeting a link to her campaign website, on which she outlined a plan to expand the Affordable Care Act and reduce out-of-pocket health-care and prescription drug costs, among other things. “Feel free to run w/it,” she offered. Right here. Includes radical provisions like how not to kick 23 mil ppl off their coverage. Feel free to run w/it.https://t.co/jBMFBJpSP7 https://t.co/zZoA16Ym03 — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) July 5, 2017  If the GOP was simply trying to get Clinton to take the bait, it worked. But the trolling seemed to backfire, based on “the ratio” — with 4,600 comments, and far fewer “likes” and retweets. The ratio on Clinton's response was far better, with more than 20 times as many “likes” as replies (and quite a few more shares) as the Internet scored the bout via memes and other responses. “I don't know who's in charge of the GOP Twitter account, but clearly they're no match for Hillary Clinton,” one person wrote on Twitter.

Some even called her out on her health-care plan — one person arguing on Twitter that it was nothing more than that: a plan. “Where's draft legislation? We all have these same ideas and plans. They need to be reduced to actual draft legislation that can be scored,” one person responded. “And I mean this of EVERYONE on the Left who is complaining about Trumpcare.” The Twitter spat came days after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tried to fast-track a vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act ahead of the Fourth of July break, then delayed it when some lawmakers asked for more time to review it. A final vote is not expected until later this month. [More Democrats embrace universal coverage — and the GOP goes on the attack] As The Washington Post's Amy Goldstein reported in November: Clinton strongly favors the Affordable Care Act. She wants to build on it in several ways, however, extending tax credits, making more people eligible for exchanges and Medicare, and tackling prescription drug prices. Though Trump has broken with conservatives of his own party on many issues, his health-policy positions are largely in line with GOP orthodoxy. He wants to end the Affordable Care Act. He also wants to transform Medicaid into state block grants, create high-risk insurance pools for people who need a lot of medical care and permit insurance to be sold across state lines. At think tanks and elsewhere, health policy experts have assessed the overall impact of the Clinton and Trump plans on the number of Americans with insurance and on federal spending. While the numbers vary, all conclude that her proposal would increase coverage and his would diminish it. Analyses disagree, though, on the impact of their plans on the federal deficit.

The Health 202: Republicans may return from recess even more skittish on health care,"THE PROGNOSIS Two health-care protestors stage a die-in.""

We thought our daughter had escaped her preexisting condition. We were wrong.,"My daughter had a stroke when she was 6 weeks old. More specifically, she suffered a brain bleed. More specifically, a burst arteriovenous malformation, which is sort of like a ruptured aneurysm. Or maybe she didn’t. It might have been this injury that led to the bleed, or it might have been something else. We can’t know with certainty what caused this catastrophic event in our lives, from which she has fully recovered. But such is the nature of medicine. It is as fickle as a child. One day, it presumes it knows what diagnosis you may have; the next, it changes its mind, or realizes it was wrong or develops a new technology to determine how to fix what might have been wrong. Of course, this wavering approach to our health isn’t a problem as long as we realize that medicine is not a perfectly understood science that always offers neat answers. If the politicians who make the laws that deal with who gets access to health care also understand this reality, we would be in decent shape. But those now holding the keys to the gates are painfully unaware of the fickle nature of the beast, and as a result, millions of patients with preexisting conditions will suffer if the proposals Congress is considering to repeal the Affordable Care Act become law. [How the Senate health-care bill will drop people with preexisting conditions] The ACA, which banned insurers from treating patients with preexisting conditions differently from anyone else, went into effect in January 2014. My daughter was born that same month and suffered the bleed that March. Once we were discharged from the NICCU at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles after two weeks, our focus shifted from our daughter’s actual health to a realization that she’d benefited from arbitrarily fortunate timing. Apart from exceptional medical luck that would allow her to recover fully, she was also lucky that this horrible injury had happened just weeks after preexisting conditions were abolished. A mere three years later, though, the government wants to take away that luck just as quickly as it had given it. Beyond our desire for her recovery was the gratitude that this lifelong thing, whatever it would be called, would always be covered. That the preexisting condition no longer existed. That this injury, of which she (obviously) and we had no advance knowledge and no means to prevent, would always be covered by insurance, even if we have an unforeseeable lapse in that coverage. That no matter how much we can provide for her — and we are lucky to carry private insurance — she would always have access to affordable care. She made the cut. Parents shouldn’t be thinking of “making the cut” when in the hospital watching their children struggle to survive in the intensive care unit, or even at home in outpatient care. They shouldn’t be thinking of rising premiums or accidental windows without coverage in the future. They should be thinking of taking their children home and putting all efforts toward their recoveries. The anxiety caused by questioning whether what is happening to your child will be covered by insurance is toxic coating on an already difficult pill to swallow. We are already sick with worry about the actual health of our children; we shouldn’t also be sick over what being sick could mean to our wallets. [Keeping my kids with diabetes alive costs thousands a year. Trumpcare terrifies me.] Because, even if infrequent, diagnoses can change, and when they do, they upend the concept of the preexisting condition in full. They may meander, shape-shift and pick up new identities and new conditions along the way, making it impossible to cut off care based on such an arbitrary label. This is at once the beauty and reality of medicine, a practice steeped in science but subject to change. Since we live in this evolving world, to have legislators draw a red line for health-care coverage is both disarming and wrong. The House of Representatives has made its decision, passing a bill that even President Trump deemed “mean,” and the Senate is struggling, shamefully, to follow suit. Their legislation rapidly lost support, and when lawmakers return to Washington next week — after, surely, hearing from parents like us about the damage their bill would do — they will enter new negotiations, new dialogue, new contemplation, all the while positing the ongoing question of this type of coverage. Republicans claim that preexisting conditions will be covered, but most independent analysts say coverage will be diminished, watered down, inexplicably costly, lending a false promise of coverage to the reality of a return to the terrifying days before the ACA took effect. We’ve followed that path before. We — my husband and I, our daughter and millions of people like us — cannot afford to turn back to it again.

Happy Hour Roundup,"* Colum Lynch and Robbie Gramer report that the Trump administration, or at least part of it, is not going to mess with Bashar Al-Assad: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres during a private State Department meeting last week that the fate of Syrian leader Bashar Al-Assad now lies in the hands of Russia, and that the Trump administration’s priority is limited to defeating the Islamic State, according to three diplomatic sources familiar with the exchange. The remarks offer the latest stop on a bumpy U.S. policy ride that has left international observers with a case of diplomatic whiplash as they try to figure out whether the Trump administration will insist that Assad step down from power. Nearly three months ago, Tillerson had insisted that Assad would have to leave office because of his alleged use of chemical weapons. Tillerson’s assurances to Guterres signaled the Trump administration’s increasing willingness to let Russia take the driver’s seat in Syria, throwing geopolitics to the wayside to focus on defeating ISIS. Of course, this policy might be contradicted by the president the next time somebody reminds him there’s a war going on in Syria. * Timothy Cama reports that the administration just suffered an environmental defeat in court: The Trump administration cannot delay an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule limiting methane pollution from oil and natural gas drilling, a federal court ruled Monday. In an early court loss for President Trump’s aggressive agenda of environmental deregulation, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the EPA didn’t meet the requirements for a 90-day stay of the Obama administration’s methane rule. The decision means the EPA must immediately start enforcing the standards. In response, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt comforted himself by watching YouTube videos of toxic sludge being poured into rivers. * David Wright reports that Rep.

Happy Hour Roundup,"* Sean Sullivan, Juliet Eilperin, and Kelsey Snell report that Republicans are not looking forward to celebrating our nation’s founding: The dispute within the Republican Party over health care widened further Friday, as President Trump joined with a handful of conservative senators in calling for an outright repeal of the Affordable Care Act if the party fails to agree on an alternative plan by the end of the July Fourth recess. The reemergence of what has for much of the year been a fringe idea within the GOP revealed not only the party’s philosophical divide over Obamacare, but also senators’ growing anxiety that they’re now headed home to see their constituents with little to show for it. It’s tough when you get blamed for trying to take coverage away from tens of millions of people, but don’t actually get the satisfaction of taking coverage away from tens of millions of people. * Shane Harris reports that we may be getting some evidence of collusion with the Russians after all, and unsurprisingly Michael Flynn is involved: Before the 2016 presidential election, a longtime Republican opposition researcher mounted an independent campaign to obtain emails he believed were stolen from Hillary Clinton’s private server, likely by Russian hackers. In conversations with members of his circle and with others he tried to recruit to help him, the GOP operative, Peter W. Smith, implied he was working with retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, at the time a senior adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump… The operation Mr. Smith described is consistent with information that has been examined by U.S. investigators probing Russian interference in the elections. Those investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from Mrs. Clinton’s server and then transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence. I look forward to Sean Hannity explaining how colluding with the Russians against your election opponent is actually what we want presidents to do. * Jenna Johnson and Abby Phillip report that pretty much everybody on both sides of the aisle thinks that Trump’s tweets are appalling. * Kim Soffen has some nice graphics showing the effects of the GOP health care bill on different states. Highlights include: West Virginia would see its uninsured rate more than quadruple by 2022. In Kentucky and Arkansas the uninsured rate would more than triple. All three states strongly supported Donald Trump in the presidential election. Rust Belt states, such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, would also see large increases in the uninsured rate.

What would it actually be like if the GOP reached out to Democrats?,
A rookie mistake or an effort to blow up repeal and replace?,"The Post reports: Friday morning, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) — a frequent critic of the president — sent [President] Trump a letter that proposed this “Plan B” for the health-care legislation: If senators have not agreed on the legislation by July 10, then Congress should “immediately repeal as much of Obamacare as is possible under congressional budget reconciliation rules,” and then cancel the August recess so that lawmakers can work six days a week writing a health-care reform package that can pass by Labor Day. “You campaigned and won on the repeal of Obamacare,” Sasse wrote in the letter to the president, which was released by his office early Friday. “So did every Republican senator. We should keep our word.” Trump immediately seized on the idea and tweeted, “If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!” Sasse later tweeted, “This plan proposes a one-yr delay after voting on repeal before it is effective. (I want real repeal & real replace–as we promised).” The idea of repeal and then work on replace later was an idea widely rejected by both House and Senate Republicans and the White House just a few months ago for obvious reasons. The Post noted: “Doing so could leave in the lurch more than 20 million Americans who now have private health plans or Medicaid coverage under the ACA and would lose that insurance with no guarantee of any alternative.” Whichever insurers haven’t already pulled out, would be sorely tempted to do so. And given how impossible it has been for Republicans to agree upon a replacement, chances are this would turn out to be repeal only. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) who seemed to have been involved in efforts to develop a replacement for Obamacare was not about to let Sasse get to his right. He soon piped up that he too wanted repeal and then argue about replacement. Then the right-wing FreedomWorks weighed in, cheering the idea. Well, perhaps Democrats should send Sasse flowers. He seems to have thrown a grenade into the negotiations that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was conducting with conservatives and moderates. Now, however, what is the incentive for other conservatives, such as Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), to be more conciliatory than the freshman Nebraska senator? It’s not clear whether Sasse was intending to blow up the possibility of a deal. He’s been an outspoken critic of the president but perhaps this was one way to get back in the good graces of the far right in his deep red state. On the other hand, he’s new at this, tending to prefer critiques of the culture and the state of politics from 30,000 feet. Could he have imagined that his letter and then invitation on the morning show he knows the president would be watching wouldn’t make McConnell’s job near impossible? He can say he was suggesting this only if negotiation broke down, but now that becomes catnip for the right and reason to avoid any compromise. The move left many simply flummoxed as to what Sasse was trying to accomplish. (Moreover, does this suggest that Sasse will vote against any bill that isn’t a complete repeal of Obamacare? If so, the GOP will never be able to pass anything.) The twist is just the latest bit of evidence that Republicans are in disarray and very confused as to how to move their agenda forward. McConnell has long been admired as a crafty legislator, but his untested skill as a dealmaker seems to be undermined at every turn. (Unless, of course, McConnell wanted to get to “no” and then move on to something else like tax reform.) In any event, the far right and the entire Democratic caucus will be delighted at the latest obstacle to compromise.

Maybe the GOP split is already here,"Since President Trump entered office, the running debate in the political class has focused on the degree to which the GOP is now the party of Trump. Will it ever repudiate him? Could traditional conservatives split from Trumpian populists? These are all variations on a theme — the fate of the GOP in the age of Trump. Since the special elections and the firing of FBI Director James B. Comey, conventional wisdom has held that there will be no internal reckoning within the GOP unless and until the 2018 midterms. Look how docile Republican leaders are! See how Republicans in polls are sticking with him? Perhaps the split already is underway. Consider four events: 1.) The Senate by a 98-2 vote passes Russia sanctions the White House did not want and, to boot, puts limits on executive discretion to waive them; 2.) Senate conservatives and moderates, in a pincer movement, halt Trumpcare. The president’s notion that it does not cut Medicaid is wildly repudiated by senators from Medicaid expansion states. (The emperor has no clothes; the bill does not have enough support); 3.) A significant number of GOP senators and congressmen condemn the president’s vulgar tweets directed at Mika Brzezinski; and 4.) Moderate House members now threaten to derail the budget (without which there can be no budget reconciliation). As to the last of these, Politico reports: Tuesday Group co-chairman Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) is gathering signatures on a letter asking Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to intervene in House Budget Chairwoman Diane Black’s plan to cut $200 billion in mandatory spending in the GOP budget. The Tuesday Group letter — which sources say has about 20 signatories so far — warns that the Tennessee Republican’s proposal is “not practical” and “could imperil tax reform,” according to a draft of the letter obtained by POLITICO. The letter also encourages GOP leaders to work with Democrats to reach a budget agreement setting higher spending levels for fiscal 2018 — something the letter suggests could be paired with a vote to raise the debt ceiling. This comes on top of near universal rejection of the president’s budget which chopped away large sections of the government and largely eviscerated soft power resources (State Department and foreign aid). Taken together, there does seem to be the spirit of defiance rolling through the GOP ranks. We are five months into this presidency, and factions have already formed in both houses — the disagreement being in which direction (hard-right or center-right) they will pull the party. Both, however, are in revolt against the Trump agenda — a peculiar mix of xenophobia, pro-Russian genuflecting, reverse Robin Hood economics and contempt for government. To be sure, some of the unrest is process-oriented. For reasons that still escape me, the White House and the House speaker thought they could force-feed prebaked agenda items to their troops, who would dutifully swallow hard and follow direction. Many have not. However, a good deal of the uprising has to do with substance, and here we see the general outline of the post-Trump struggle that will unfold. Emboldened by one act of defiance, lawmakers feel more comfortable doing it a second and third time. There is no benefit of the doubt extended to the White House. On one side stand the ossified conservatives, who espouse an anti-government animus that has little resonance with an electorate demanding more, not less, from government. They embrace the know-nothingism of populism but plant their flag on the far-right wing of the party on everything from discrimination against gays to climate-change denial to anti-immigrant hysteria. On the other side stand, in both the House and Senate (and importantly, the governorships), the so-called moderates, some of whom are actually quite conservative but nevertheless reject both Trump and the zombie conservatism from the 1980s. As we’ve discussed, these are not split-the-difference compromisers. They have strong views on immigration (pro), the safety net (they want one), climate change (they believe in it), globalization (it’s here to stay) and Russia (against). In a sense, then, Trump has already lost control of the party. For now, this takes the form of factional warfare and paralysis, but few can look at the past few weeks and say Trump has a grip on the rank and file. He cannot keep Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) from investigating the Russia scandal or Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) from calling foul on Medicaid cuts or Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) from devising harsh anti-Russia sanctions. More and more, lawmakers are choosing to shake their heads in disbelief at Trump’s willful ignorance  — and then ignore him. We hope this is a trend that builds, not a momentary spasm. Rebels should be encouraged and respected, even when their specific policy preferences strike us as off-base. The country needs two sane parties, both working against an unfit president.

The Health 202: The CBO is caught in a health-care tug of war,"THE PROGNOSIS The Congressional Budget Office -- a six-story, gray stone building a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol where analysts crunch numbers -- isn't exactly a government agency that's top of Americans' minds. Yet the CBO's work has become central in the debate over repealing and replacing Obamacare as both Democrats and Republicans seek for its projections to support their own health-care narrative. Republicans want to be able to tell the public a positive story about their health-care bill and how it would reshape the Affordable Care Act. Democrats want to further their negative narrative that the Better Care Reconciliation Act would cause fewer Americans to have coverage. But they can't just pull the numbers out of thin air. It's up to the CBO to estimate how many people would be covered under the Senate bill, how it would affect insurance costs and how much it would cost altogether. Yesterday, the CBO released a new, longer-term analysis of the Senate health-care bill at the prodding of the Finance Committee's senior Democrat from Oregon, Ron Wyden. It hammers home the point that the measure would cause sweeping cuts to Medicaid, even beyond the next decade. Twenty years from now, the GOP measure would lower federal Medicaid spending by a whopping 35 percent, the agency said. The extra analysis punctuates an initial score from the CBO, which had originally looked forward only a decade. It found that federal Medicaid spending would dip by 26 percent in 2026, resulting in $772 billion less funding for states to run the program and 15 million fewer Americans covered by it. Democrats had already been criticizing those figures. But Wyden requested the longer-term outlook so he'd have an even more dramatic figure to use for bludgeoning Republicans. He was basically training a spotlight on what some Republicans have sought to bury, my colleague Amy Goldstein reports. Eliciting a longer view from the budget office was part of a strategy by the Senate’s minority party to ratchet up pressure on moderate Republicans"
Many veterans would suffer under Republican health-care plan,"As Republicans strive mightily — and perversely — for a health-care system that would increase the uninsured by 22 million people, they should ponder the impact on a particularly deserving group — veterans. It’s not unexpected that heartless GOP plans would be hard on the vulnerable, but do they realize that includes many who continue to suffer from their service? These are people largely supportive of Republicans, including President Trump, who had the insight to call the House plan “mean.” Republicans honor veterans, but you can’t tell it by their current health-care proposals. The GOP plans do not directly affect the Veterans Affairs Department’s extensive system of health services. About 7 million vets, however, get their care outside of VA services. After the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, kicked in, the number of vets without insurance dropped by almost 40 percent, according to Sen. Jon Tester (Mont.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and other committee members. Republicans would reverse that trend. Tester and his Democratic colleagues said the Senate bill could: The Republican committee chairman and the Trump administration had the chance to refute the data presented by the Democrats, but they did not. “As the Secretary (David Shulkin) has said, until the legislative process runs its course, we are not going to speculate on details of a possible bill,” a VA statement said. “Once a bill is agreed on, we will be in a position to review potential impacts on VA.” Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) said: “We have been working in a bipartisan manner to improve veterans’ access to quality and timely care. We will continue doing so and hope that Democrats’ recent attempts to politicize veterans’ health care won’t hamper our efforts.” Exit polls indicate 60 percent of those who served in the military supported Trump’s election, about the same portion of veterans who voted for Republican House candidates in 2014. Now this unpopularly elected president is working to drum up support for the very unpopular Republican proposals. In five recent polls, the approval ratings for the Republican health-care plan ranged from a miserable 16 percent to a pitiful 30 percent, sometimes with a significant percentage undecided. “This plan, written in secret, will devastate thousands of elderly, disabled and rural veterans who go outside of the VA for all or some of their health care,” Tester said. “This plan guts Medicaid, which provides lifesaving treatment, mental-health care and access to a health-care provider for thousands of folks who have bravely served this nation. I will be working hard to make sure that any health- care law honors our promises to our veterans, but this plan doesn’t even come close.” He was joined in outrage by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray (Wash.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Joe Manchin III (W. Va.), and Sherrod Brown (Ohio). “Our country makes a promise to take care of the men and women who serve, but Trumpcare would do just the opposite,” Murray said. Added Blumenthal: “Every Member of Congress who plans to support this bill needs to imagine looking a veteran in the eye and telling them why their mental-health care for PTS (post-traumatic stress) has been halted, or why they can no longer afford treatment for traumatic brain injury sustained while serving their country.” Major veterans service organizations are taking a cautious approach to the GOP health-care proposals, if they have anything to say at all. Disabled American Veterans (DAV) is one organization staying vigilant on the debate and what it means for those who carry the pain of war. “DAV is carefully monitoring how changes to the Affordable Care Act could impact ill and injured veterans who served and sacrificed for our nation,’ said Executive Director Garry Augustine. “VA’s budget this year is already insufficient to meet all the requirements Congress has placed on the department to care for our nation’s ill and injured veterans. Any additional demand on the system may aggravate the current fiscal constraints and effect the delivery of care to millions of veterans who use and rely on VA.” He concluded with this forceful warning: “We will not idly sit by while political posturing threatens to jeopardize the health of our nation’s heroes.” Read more: [GOP health-care debate turns to stark question: help vulnerable Americans, or help the rich?] [Is the GOP trying to repeal and replace itself?] [Will VA chief be voice of reason on climate change and medical marijuana in Trump administration?] "
Just when you thought the GOP health-care bill couldn’t get worse …,"The Post reports: The updated Medicaid estimate from the [Congressional Budget Office], which shows how spending would shrink over the next 20 years, underscored the extent to which McConnell’s plan would squeeze the longstanding public insurance program. The current draft already cuts $772 billion over 10 years from Medicaid, which covers poor Americans as well as the elderly, children and pregnant women. The updated analysis, requested by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and other Senate Democrats, calculated the impact of pegging the program’s inflation rate to the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers, as opposed to the medical inflation rate. According to analysts at the health consulting firm Avalere and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, this would translate into a cut of at least $330 billion in 2036. That amounts to a 35 percent cut in Medicaid over the next 20 years. At a time President Trump is spouting the fiction that his bill does not cut Medicaid and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is trying to buy off moderates with $45 billion to fight opioid abuse, the CBO report deals another blow to Trumpcare’s prospects. Meanwhile, more Republicans are talking about keeping the 3.8 percent Medicare tax imposed by Obamacare so as to tamp down on the criticism that they are cutting Medicaid to give big tax cuts to the rich. The likelihood that massive Medicaid cuts will be acceptable to GOP moderates from states that expanded Medicaid is diminishing. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) blasted the bill again, citing the new numbers. “The Senate version of Trumpcare is even worse than we thought,” he said. “This new CBO report makes clear that the Senate’s Trumpcare bill would cause people to lose their Medicaid coverage, blow a huge hole in state budgets that would make states choose between raising taxes on the middle class or gutting funding for priorities like health care and education, and make it harder for families with a loved one in a nursing home or a disabled child to afford get the care they need.” There are, however, two interesting developments on the GOP side. First, Republicans have finally figured out that the Obamacare taxes cannot go away, at least not all of them. It is progress when Republicans realize how unseemly it is to give rich people huge tax cuts while slashing Medicaid. The problem — slashing Medicaid — nevertheless remains. Second, even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who once forced a government shutdown over his insistence of repealing Obamacare, now would leave Obamacare in place — so long as there was an unregulated option for consumers. However, as soon as it became obvious that the alternative plans wouldn’t protect those with preexisting conditions, its chances of success dropped dramatically. (Of course allowing healthier and younger people to buy non-Obamacare plans would just leave sicker, older people in Obamacare plans, with even greater increases in premiums.) Republicans seem flummoxed. They’ve called Obamacare a disaster for so long, they’ve never really wrestled with the problems endemic in health-care reform. The need to balance access, affordability, consumer protection and the demands of a humane safety net can be daunting. Yes, who knew health care could be so complicated? You do wonder how long it will be before GOP moderates make a break for it and set out to come up with an Obamacare fix-it plan with the help of Democrats. After all, in reconciliation they’d need only 51 votes.

The moment for radical moderates,"The common misconception about moderates is that they are mushy compromisers, willing to split the difference in search of deals. They are accused of having no ideological grounding or set of principles. Actually, that aptly describes the narcissistic know-nothing who occupies the White House, who is anything but moderate. Peter Wehner, a conservative thinker and former official in President George W. Bush’s administration, wrote: Moderation does not mean truth is always found equidistant between two extreme positions, nor does it mean that bold and at times even radical steps are not necessary to advance moral ends. Moderation takes into account what is needed at any given moment; it allows circumstances to determine action in the way that weather patterns dictate which route a ship will follow. But there are general characteristics we associate with moderation, including prudence, the humility to recognize limits (including our own), the willingness to balance competing principles and an aversion to fanaticism. Moderation accepts the complexity of life in this world and distrusts utopian visions and simple solutions. The way to think about moderation is as a disposition, not as an ideology. Its antithesis is not conviction but intemperance. The real moderates, and the best display of moderate politics we have seen this year, are on display in the health-care debate. We see the true attributes of moderation in their struggle to find an acceptable and worthwhile outcome from the current chaos and paralysis that envelops the GOP. To begin with, moderates need not be followers, or weak sisters and brothers. Here Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) (usually not considered a “moderate”) are leading the charge. They stood up to White House and leadership pressure. They took a stance for which they knew they would be attacked. In doing so, they derailed a rushed vote on a terrible bill. They have stopped a bill — for now — which would leave millions of vulnerable Americans without health-care coverage. Second, they are not split-the-baby types. They have not said, “Could we throw just 15 million off Medicaid?” They have not said, “Maybe if we just whack older, sicker and more rural Americans a little less, we could get on board.” This no doubt perplexes leadership, who will try to buy them off with a one-time lump payment for opioid abuse. So far the moderates aren’t buying it. Third, moderates have a nose for where interests overlap and deals can be made. They rightly see that there will be no bill if mammoth tax cuts for the rich are paired with big Medicaid cuts, so take both off the table. They identify the problem — the exchanges — that is capable of a solution. The Collins-Cassidy health-care bill introduced in January suggests some states could keep the Affordable Care Act while others could adopt a system that provides comparable benefits. (“The State could continue to receive funding equal to 95% of federal premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies, as well as the federal match for Medicaid expansion. States can choose to receive funds in the form of per beneficiary grants or advanceable, refundable tax credits, but in both cases, funds will be deposited in a Roth Health Savings Account (HSA), meaning the money will go directly to the patient.”) But they are flexible as to the means for achieving their aims. Fourth, they state their priorities — providing affordable coverage takes precedence over tax cuts for the rich. (To their credit, hard-right opponents of the Senate bill such as Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas are hinting they will do the same.) Fifth, they have a simple rubric: What’s best for the people I represent? They reject turning concrete, specific policy choices into sweeping statements of ideological purity. The goal of the health-care bill should be improved health care, not “freedom” (to be dumped from Medicaid?). They take a problem-solving approach that allows negotiators to overcome tribalistic instincts. “Republicans don’t believe in X” can become “Republicans can accept this solution because it does Y.” Sixth, they do not hide behind rash promises (Repeal and replace Obamacare with something cheaper that covers everyone with better coverage!). They are willing to adopt the Burkean view that representatives owe the public their best judgment and expertise, not a mouthpiece who channels the voice of the mob. Seventh, they refuse to lie and to make up facts to suit their argument. Collins point-blank rejects the notion (already rebutted by the Congressional Budget Office) that Medicaid isn’t being cut. (Simply put, if you got the promise of a 1 percent raise every year with the cost of living going up 2 percent, would you be satisfied that your salary isn’t being cut? And, if you knew your boss would only fund half the raises he promised, would you feel secure?) There is no guarantee this will work; in fact, given the GOP leadership and the White House, it likely won’t. But it is the sort of politics we should aim for. Democrats and Republicans will fight over how big the state, how high the taxes, how uniform the rules must be. They can fight over priorities (tax cuts for the rich vs. fiscal sobriety). But the aim can be to solve the problems they can and avoid blowing up the system for the sake of tribal identity. That’s all we can expect from politicians.

This remarkable moment perfectly captures Trumpcare in all its cruel absurdity,"THE MORNING PLUM: With the GOP’s repeal-and-replace bill hanging in the balance, Politico reports that Republican Senate leaders are trying to entice moderate GOP holdouts with the promise of an additional $45 billion in spending to counter the opioid crisis. One administration source tells Axios that the game plan is to try to “bribe” moderates with this extra spending, while trying to win over conservatives with longer-term reforms. This money is basically chump change, relative to the massive coverage loss the bill would produce, and if moderates were going to remain true to their own previous criticisms of that coverage loss, they would not allow themselves to be “bribed” by it. But there are grounds for thinking it has a chance of working. The reason is perfectly captured in a behind-the-scenes anecdote that took place among Republican senators, when they learned about the Congressional Budget Office score of the Senate bill, which projected that 15 million fewer people would be covered by Medicaid due to its enormous cuts to the program. CBO found that a total of 22 million fewer people would be covered by 2026. The Post has a long look at the “awkward moments” that have gone on between President Trump and GOP senators in the lead-up to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) decision to put the bill on hold while he tries to secure 50 votes for it. I wanted to flag this moment: A lobbyist close to Senate Republicans said the score was a devastating blow to McConnell. Senators felt they had been “sold a bill of goods,” the lobbyist said, and had expected the Senate bill to have greater distance from the House bill. “It knocked the wind out of all the sails,” said a GOP aide. Senators began to shift into two camps: those who wanted to attack the CBO’s methodology, and those who realized it would not matter once people back in their states heard the numbers. If GOP senators expected the Senate bill to achieve “greater distance” from the House bill, then they were either not reckoning with the fundamental underlying realities of what GOP health reform is trying to accomplish, or they were hoping for some magical formula to materialize that would obscure those realities from view. Here is the basic math: If you are going to cut Obamacare’s taxes on rich people by hundreds of billions of dollars, you are going to have to roll back an enormous chunk of the law’s massive coverage expansion. The Senate bill keeps the House bill’s tax cuts, so the coverage loss was inevitably going to be extremely large, just as the House bill’s was (the House bill’s coverage loss was projected at 23 million, 14 million from Medicaid). It’s hard to say what could have achieved “more distance” from this, but no amount of actually achievable distance would blunt the large-scale impact of that basic set of priorities in any serious way. The thing is that we know some Republican moderates already knew this to be the case. The compromise proposal introduced by Sens. Susan Collins, Bill Cassidy and Shelley Moore Capito would have kept the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion more or less in place while allowing states more leeway to structure their individual markets in their own ways. As health policy expert Nicholas Bagley put it, this proposal was designed to “[retain] the ACA’s taxes and funding streams.” The very thing that made this a compromise is that it did not seek to achieve the interrelated huge tax cuts for the wealthy and draconian coverage rollback for the poor and lower-middle-class that the Senate and House bills do. This is also the very thing that led most Republicans to ignore it. Republicans of course understood this to be the trade-off at the core of their reform agenda. Yet the Post report indicates that Republican senators were surprised to learn that the CBO concluded that their bill would indeed carry out this trade-off. And they responded by dividing into two camps — one that would attack the purveyor of dispassionate, empirical analysis that had confirmed this to be the case; and one that thought this was futile, because the argument could not be won, once voters back home learned how many people would lose coverage under their bill. But why did they expect any other outcome in the first place? This is another reminder that, as Jonathan Chait notes, the health-care debate has been gripped throughout by a refusal on the part of Republicans to forthrightly acknowledge or defend their own actual priorities. In some cases, this has been deeply cynical, with Republicans claiming that no one will be worse off because everyone will have “access” to insurance, or even that the bill wouldn’t cut Medicaid at all. In the case of President Trump, it’s hard to disentangle his cynicism from his seemingly impenetrable ignorance. Trump has complained behind closed doors that the House bill is “mean,” and has called for “more money” to be added, which suggests he dimly grasps that cutting health-care spending on poor people will hurt them. On the other hand, he was reportedly surprised to learn that his bill would accomplish this while deeply cutting taxes on rich people, so perhaps he doesn’t fully grasp the basic trade-off here. Regardless, Trump has now been informed by the CBO that the Senate bill is just as “mean” as the House bill, yet he continues to champion it, anyway. In a sense, moderate Republicans have ripped the lid off this whole routine. A number of them have condemned the Senate bill’s Medicaid cuts as unacceptably draconian toward the vulnerable, which has had the effect of conceding that the bill would effect the massive rollback of coverage that the CBO says it would. Yet they still appear to be persuadable with buy-offs that would do relatively little to mitigate the human toll that this rollback would bring about. This suggests that to some degree they remain in the same place as the senators who were supposedly surprised by the CBO score: They are still hoping to find some magical escape hatch from a political and moral predicament that is inextricably linked to the unmovable fact that the GOP reforms would do exactly what they are supposed to do. But here’s the thing: Either moderate Republicans are for huge tax cuts for the rich that will cost double-digit millions their coverage, or they are against them. * A FEW REPUBLICANS RETHINK TAX CUTS FOR RICH: Bloomberg Politics reports that a handful of GOP senators (such as Susan Collins of Maine) are beginning to question their health bill’s huge tax cuts for the rich. Note this from Bob Corker of Tennessee: “I want to make sure that we’re not in a situation where we’re cutting taxes for the wealthy and at the same time, basically, for lower income citizens, passing a larger burden on to them,” Corker said. Told that what he described is what the CBO projects would happen, he responded, “So that needs to be overcome then, doesn’t it?” Overcome? That would be great, but does Sen. Corker know what party he belongs to? * HOUSE TO GIVE TRUMP A BIG WIN TODAY: CNN reports that the House is expected Thursday to pass a bill that would raise the maximum prison sentence to 10 years for people with a felony conviction or who illegally enter the country after being deported three or more times: Critics say the bill would aggressively criminalize even non-criminal undocumented immigrants. Being in the country illegally carries only civil penalties. They also accuse the administration of unfairly and inaccurately portraying immigrants as criminals … CNN notes this would be a “win” for Trump. It will be interesting to see how many Senate Democrats from states Trump won feel compelled to support this. * GOP FAILURE ON HEALTH CARE COULD IMPERIL TAX REFORM: The Associated Press reports that if the Senate health bill fails, it could put tax reform — which many Republicans view as even more important — at risk of failure, too: The health bill provides nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts that won’t add to the nation’s mounting debt. Republicans are counting on those tax cuts to help them write a new tax code that raises less money. Also, Republicans are using a complicated rule that enables the Senate to pass both a health bill and a tax package with a simple majority. … Under the rule, Congress has to resolve health care — by either passing a bill or killing it — before lawmakers can pass a tax package. It would be tragic if the failure of the first round of huge GOP tax cuts for the rich ended up scuttling the second round of huge GOP tax cuts for the rich. * HOUSE RUSSIA PROBE WILL INTERVIEW TRUMP’S BODY MAN: ABC News reports that the House Intelligence Committee probing Russian meddling and possible collusion now wants to interview Keith Schiller, Trump’s longtime bodyguard-turned-White House aide: It’s the latest indication that the government’s multiple investigations are touching Trump’s inner circle. … The growing list of other Trump associates the committee has said they want to meet includes former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. … Several White House aides expressed privately to ABC News that they are expecting to hear from Congress or the special counsel. Maybe if Trump tweets the words “FAKE NEWS” and “DEM HOAX” in capital letters enough times, he can make all this disappear. * THE GOAL OF GOP’S ‘UNCERTAINTY’ STRATEGY: Health policy experts Craig Garthwaite and Nicholas Bagley have a great piece explaining the GOP strategy of refusing to guarantee cost-sharing subsidies to insurers and sowing uncertainty about the ACA in other ways: Even with protective policies in place, insurers took a big risk entering the markets. At a minimum, insurers that took the plunge deserved the support promised in the law. Congressional Republicans, however, chose instead to sow uncertainty at every turn, hoping that a damaged reform law would be easier to repeal. … Because insurers don’t know whether the government will honor its commitment to pay those subsidies, they’ve had to ask for double-digit rate increases. Put another way, Republicans are deliberately trying to destabilize the markets in ways that could leave millions without coverage to build political support for leaving still more millions in the lurch. * FORGET FANTASIES ABOUT BIPARTISANSHIP ON HEALTH REFORM: E.J. Dionne Jr. has a great column explaining that there’s no way Democrats can cooperate with Republicans in fixing the health-care system until the latter let go of their priorities: There is no getting around it. You can’t do what the GOP wants to do without hurting a lot of people. This is why pious pleas for the parties to work together are, for now, empty. Of course it would be far better for Democrats and Republicans to agree on ways to improve our health system, and it’s nice to hear a few GOP senators saying so. To get to that point, Republicans would have to abandon the fiction that they can slash spending on subsidies and Medicaid without anyone paying a price. Indeed, this fundamental ideological difference is exactly why Republicans are pursuing their bill on a partisan basis. * AND REPUBLICANS WORRY TRUMP COULD TURN ON THEM: Julie Pace reports that some Republicans are worried that Trump’s suggestion that the health bill is “mean” could portend bad things later: One Republican congressional aide said that comment left some lawmakers worried that the president — who had no real ties to the GOP before running for the White House — could turn on them if a bill passes but the follow-up becomes politically damaging. The official insisted on anonymity in order to describe private discussions. Seems like a personally reasonable fear, doesn’t it?

How to fix Republicans’ reality gap while helping the country and the GOP base,"We have seen in the health-care debate that what Republicans have promised and what the public actually wants are two different things. Their libertarian-ish view of health care and some old saws in the conservative agenda are badly out of step with the times. The Quinnipiac poll provides one more indication of how few people (16 percent) like the Senate’s handiwork. If you look further, the numbers are even more striking. For starters, the political club that the GOP leadership has used — we must do this or we’ll lose in 2018 — is wrong. “If a U.S. Senator or member of Congress votes for the Republican plan, 46 percent of voters are less likely to support their reelection, with 17 percent more likely and 33 percent who say the health care vote won’t matter in their decision.” This makes sense; doing something bad is much riskier than moving on to get wins on other topics. A total of 80 percent want to either leave parts of Obamacare in place (53 percent) or leave it alone (27 percent). A measly 17 percent agree with the GOP’s mantra to repeal the whole thing. Evidence abounds that if we ever get to the merits of health care, the GOP — as currently constituted — is in big trouble: American voters oppose 71 – 24 percent, including 53 – 39 percent among Republicans, decreasing federal funding for Medicaid. Voters also oppose 61 – 35 percent cutting off federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Opposition to cutting Planned Parenthood funding jumps to 80 – 15 percent, including 67 – 25 percent among Republicans, when it is explained that federal funding for Planned Parenthood is used only for non-abortion health services such as breast cancer screenings. American voters support 60 – 33 percent “an expansion of Medicare that would make it available to any American who wants it, also known as universal health care.” Republicans oppose this idea 57 – 33 percent, while every other listed group supports it by wide margins. For years, the right has been telling its troops that its policy objectives are in step with what Americans really want. That might have been true at one point, but that’s no longer the case. Republicans might want to consider that President Trump got elected because: (a.) Hillary Clinton was his dream opponent and (b.) he rejected the GOP agenda. If the GOP is to hold onto Congress in 2018 and 2020, it should spend ample time rethinking its agenda. Not only is the GOP’s health-care plan a loser, but its main tax “reform” objective — cutting taxes for the rich — is grossly unpopular. Basing the party’s agenda on tearing up the safety net and widening the inequality gap at a time of enormous economic uncertainty and social atomization and polarization seems foolhardy. And cruel. Recent data suggest a good place for Republicans to start updating their agenda and shedding the rich-guy party image — without slipping into know-nothing protectionism, nationalism and xenophobia — is coincidentally (or not) where their base was angriest and most enthusiastic about having a champion in the White House. The U.S. Census tells us that while the country is growing more diverse and growth is picking up, rural America is getting older and poorer and remaining mostly white. As the Brookings Institution framed it: “Since 2000, the white percentage of the nation’s metropolitan population declined from 67 percent to 58 percent, commensurate with the nation’s diversity surge. During the same period, the nonmetropolitan population’s white percentage remained much higher—declining only from 82 percent to 78 percent.” In comparison with urban areas, nonmetropolitan areas are older (“one-third of nonmetropolitan residents now belong to [the 55 and older] age category, compared with 27 percent in metropolitan areas”) and are shedding population. (“Between 2010 and 2016, it sustained a 0.4 percent decline and a net out-migration of 680,000 people. This contrasts with a nearly 6 percent growth rate and net in-migration for metropolitan areas. Fully two-thirds of all nonmetropolitan counties lost population and nearly three-quarters experienced net out-migration during this period.”) Immigrants are not stealing their jobs; to the contrary, communities are losing population, which shrinks their local economies. Contrast that with states such as Texas and California where diversity and growth are up. So rather than coming up with policies that hurt older, poorer and more rural Americans and convincing them that outsiders are their enemies, how about some creative policies to respond to the heartland’s needs? In some cases, that may mean moving people to where the jobs are; in others, it may be incentivizing tech companies to populate the interior of the country. This may require public-private partnerships, intensive apprenticeship programs and an actual infrastructure bill that can prioritize rural areas. (In this case, infrastructure must include broadband.). As Republicans who believe in federalism, Republicans can allow states to experiment. The key, however, is not shutting the world out, but opening it up to rural America. At least Republicans won’t be hurting the very people who lifted them to victory in 2016. Indeed, it’s such a no-brainer that if Republicans don’t do it Democrats will — and they’ll snatch back Trump’s base.

Morning Bits,"A big win for the French president if his plan works. “Mr. Macron is trying to revise more than 3,000 pages of labor rules that employers say discourage hiring by making it complicated and financially risky to dismiss workers. His proposals include capping fines for unfair dismissals and giving companies more leeway to work around rules set by unions.” At least the Senate Intelligence Committee is hard at work. “The Senate Intelligence Committee has reached an agreement to receive memos written by former FBI Director James Comey detailing his interactions with President Donald Trump, Chairman Richard Burr (R-N.C.) told POLITICO on Wednesday. It had been an open question whether Congress would get access to the memos, which several committees in both the House and Senate have demanded to see.” Reverse Robin Hood schemes don’t work. “Even previous Republican tax-cut bills that channeled most of their benefits to the highest earners had some benefits trickle down to the middle class. The health-care bills differ in that they fund their tax cuts by revoking aid for older and lower middle-income adults. Resistance to that trade inside the GOP caucus helps explain why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was compelled on Tuesday to shelve the bill until after the July 4 recess.” Bullying Carrier to keep jobs in the United States predictably did not work. “The layoffs prove just how difficult it is for government officials to keep jobs in the United States. Millions of dollars have been spent to save only a few hundred jobs, and hundreds more jobs are going to be lost regardless.” Working his whole life for himself and being accountable to no one leaves him clueless about 21st-century business conduct. Or maybe he just can’t control his piggish behavior. “Irish Reporter Calls Out Donald Trump for Calling Her ‘Beautiful.’ ” Makes you wonder if he ever listens to anything Ivanka tells him. Republicans at work for Americans — at least the rich ones. “The Better Care Reconciliation Act would reduce tax revenue by $700 billion, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center. Fully 45 percent of those tax cuts will go to the top 1 percent of earners, and 67 percent of the benefits to the top 20 percent.” Something is working in California. “The California economy got hit harder than the rest of the country in the last recession. After a sluggish initial recovery, the nation’s largest state hit its stride by the end of 2011 and in the ensuing five years has grown at a 3.5% annual rate—a respectable pace even by pre-secular stagnation standards. Meanwhile, the rest of the country grew at a pokier 1.7% rate over that same period.” Now we need to spread the tech revolution to the rest of the country.

How Trump is a little bit right and a lot bit wrong about Medicaid,"President Trump on Wednesday said that the Republican plan to change Medicaid would lead to an increase in spending, not a cut, accusing Democrats of having “purposely misstated” the facts. In a literal sense, he's right. The total amount of money spent on Medicaid under the Senate Republican plan would grow, albeit slowly, from 2017 to 2026. Democrats purposely misstated Medicaid under new Senate bill - actually goes up. pic.twitter.com/necCt4K6UH — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017  But the accounting he uses to show Medicaid spending is wildly divergent from the way budget analysts, policymakers and many lawmakers account for spending levels. Medicaid spending under the Republican plan would not increase when accounting for the inflation of medical costs. In fact, it would mark a “a reduction of $772 billion in federal outlays for Medicaid” over 10 years compared with what would happen if the Senate bill is not enacted into law, the Congressional Budget Office said Monday.  In his Twitter post, which marks one of the only times he has weighed in on Medicaid since becoming president, Trump adopts an argument made many times by his budget director, Mick Mulvaney. Mulvaney has said that any absolute increase in government spending, regardless of inflation, should be considered an increase. This, however, is often not how government budgets are tabulated. Government budget officials look at what would happen under existing law, a process they consider setting the “baseline,” and then factor in whether a new proposal would increase or decrease that baseline. Viewed through that lens, here's how Trump's chart looks.  The Senate Republican bill would, among other things, propose setting caps on Medicaid spending and then only increasing those caps by a measurement of inflation that increases more slowly than medical cost increases. For example, Medicaid spending under existing law would grow from $393 billion in 2017 to $415 billion in 2018 and then eventually to $624 billion in 2026. Under the Senate Republican plan, Medicaid spending would grow much more slowly, reaching $405 billion in 2018 and just $464 billion in 2026. That’s a larger dollar amount, but the number is misleading because it doesn't take into account inflation, historical increases in medical costs, and a range of other things. Medical costs tend to rise more quickly than inflation, but the Senate bill is designed so that increases in the cost of health care will eventually outpace annual increases in Medicaid. The CBO estimated that there would be 15 million fewer Medicaid beneficiaries under the GOP plan by 2026 than under existing law. "
Getting to ‘yes’ means narrowing the question,"We are hard pressed to recall a major piece of legislation championed by one party and the president that got only 12 percent approval. That’s the level of support the latest USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows for the Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act. The bill itself pleases practically no one — not even Republicans (“only 26% support the Senate bill; 17% oppose it. A 52% majority say they need more information before they can express a view”). More fundamentally, Republicans are isolated in their desire to repeal Obamacare at all costs. Among all voters “a 53% majority say Congress should either leave the law known as Obamacare alone or work to fix its problems while keeping its framework intact. . . . Eight in 10 Republicans support repeal, and close to a third say the law should be repealed even if a replacement health care plan isn’t ready yet. Just 11% of independents and 2% of Democrats feel that way.” This, I would suggest, is largely a function of the GOP tribal chant that Obamacare must be repealed — without specifying what is possible without keeping or raising taxes. But if we wanted to start over to find a resolution for the problem voters complain about — insurance in the exchanges is too expensive and insurers are dropping out — some principles are clear. First, “77%, say it is ‘very important’ that the health care system permit people with pre-existing medical conditions to buy health insurance at the same price as others. Just 6% say that protection isn’t important to them.” That means the Senate bill allowing opt-out for preexisting conditions isn’t going to fly — unless they fully fund high risk pools that get very, very expensive. Second, “Nearly two-thirds, 63%, say it is ‘very important’ that lower-income people who became eligible for Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act continued to be covered by Medicaid. Just 10% say that isn’t important to them.” That means the premise of the GOP bill — that repeal and replace must roll back Medicaid — does not match the view of the vast majority of Americans. No wonder President Trump ran against rolling back Medicaid. Third, “Close to six in 10, 57%, say it is ‘very important’ that insurance premiums go down in price; 17% say that’s not important.” I’m sure roughly the same would be said of deductibles. Given all that, is any bill other than Obamacare itself going to get a majority support? There is an easy way to find out. Take Medicaid cuts off the table. Take tax cuts off the table. Put together a bipartisan group of governors and lawmakers. Call it a commission. Have open hearings around the country. Let insurance companies, doctors, patient groups, economists, the Congressional Budget Office and others come testify. Have them write a bill for an up or down vote in Congress. If it goes down, we move on. If it passes, we’re all the better for it. If this sounds familiar it closely follows the Simpson-Bowles Commission approach. That did not result in final legislation because Republicans wouldn’t agree to tax hikes and Democrats wouldn’t agree to entitlement cuts. Here, however, we’re taking Medicaid and tax cuts off the table and focusing on the non-elderly, able-bodied individual health-care market. That’s a narrower problem, arguably. If nothing else, the process might tell Americans that their expectations — lower premiums, lower deductibles, more choices and no tax hikes — are not remotely possible. That in and of itself might be an eye-opener. And we might get some answers to questions that went unanswered because the GOP decided to act behind closed doors. (Why are insurers fleeing the exchanges? Did the rate of increases change under Obamacare? What would it cost to maintain high-risk pools? Can the individual mandates be reworked to make certain young, healthy people do not game the system?) The best part of this process? Congress could move to other things without admitting defeat.

Some surprising winners and losers from the Senate health-care bill,"These days most politicians are cowards. More than anything they fear losing their seat or losing the support of their base and interest groups. They don’t stick their necks out; they like to move in lockstep with others to provide cover. If you had any doubt, look at the batch of GOP senators who came out to oppose the Better Care Reconciliation Act after a vote was delayed. That operating style frustrates the public and undermines good governance, but it’s unfortunately a strategy that usually pays off, especially when heightened tribalism dominates our political culture. In the case  of health care, however, the followers who marched in lock step turned out to be the losers; the winners in the GOP were those who went against the tide in their own party. On the Democratic side, the pols who did not leave the heavy lifting to others have improved their standing with their party and their visibility with the country at large. On the House side, the moderates who got dragooned into voting for the awful American Health Care Act look weak, foolish and politically vulnerable. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) unnecessarily exposed his members to risky votes, got a terrible bill and may lose his majority as a result. In the Senate, Republican lawmakers who applauded the Senate bill in knee-jerk fashion similarly looked craven. The GOP lawmakers who were quiet, AWOL when it mattered, preferring to mumble something about their “concerns” over the bill lost a golden opportunity to distinguish themselves. Instead, Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) in particular gained new respect as bold, independent voices. Among moderates the wishy-washy and silent senators did not cover themselves in glory. By contrast, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) was the earliest and therefore the most influential voice. Likewise, GOP governors who have their own base of support, almost always (except in deep red states) greater bipartisan support and more granular knowledge of health care than Capitol Hill Republicans had an opportunity to rise to the occasion. On the Democratic, surprisingly few governors took a very public role — and will be rewarded for it. A bipartisan group of seven decided to take matters into their own hand. Republican Govs. John Kasich (Ohio), Brian Sandoval (Nev.), Charlie Baker (Mass.) and Democratic Govs. Steve Bullock (Mont.), John Bel Edwards (La.), John Hickenlooper (Colo.) and Tom Wolf (Pa.) looked like real leaders in opposing the bill and actively lobbying their delegations. But where were Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Florida Gov. Rick Scott? Asleep at the political switch or on the wrong side of a bill that would have devastated their states. On the Democratic side,those who put themselves front and center, especially Hickenlooper, will get credit if the bill does finally and permanently go down in flames. Showing up, really is 90 percent of life. The dynamic within the Democratic Party is interesting. Those Democrats who have spent the past week crying over the Georgia 6th Congressional District special election results and savaging House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) look small, petty and irrelevant. By contrast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), from the center of the party, is getting plaudits for keeping his troops in line and the spotlight on the GOP’s monstrous legislation. In addition, the network of progressive activists, number-crunchers, organizers and interest groups that put their heads down and worked the phones (and the town halls) have done themselves and their party a world of good. Republicans can deny they had an impact but the data that the left surfaced, the analysis they provided on the bill’s impact and the pressure they exerted in states that expanded Medicaid cannot be discounted. The “stop whining” forces, regardless of ideology, came out on top. In sum, for once the cynics and politically timid came up short. Those who were not afraid to stick their heads up and get to work showed participatory democracy isn’t dead — yet.

Trump’s health care promises are coming back to haunt him,"President Trump was swept into office by a populist wave enthralled by his promise of better jobs and a tax cut for the middle class. But in his first major legislative effort, changing health care laws, he is faced with a bitter populist backlash that has splintered the Republican Party and put his entire agenda on the ropes. The Senate’s health care bill, which was put on hold Tuesday, would repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, cap future spending on Medicaid, and cut roughly $700 billion in taxes over 10 years. Some of these tax cuts would benefit primarily the wealthy, because their capital gains rates would be lowered. And the Medicaid cuts would disproportionately impact the poor, as it is a program run by states and the federal government delivering health benefits for low-income Americans. The bill would also, according to the Congressional Budget Office, lead to 22 million fewer people having health insurance after 10 years. When Trump campaigned, he vowed to protect Medicaid from cuts and his top advisers said they would not pursue tax cuts that allowed the wealthy to reduce the overall amount of taxes they pay. But the House and Senate health care bills reverse both of those pledges. The bills are roundly opposed by Democrats, but Tuesday saw major cracks in the Republican Party’s support, at times invoking arguments often made by Democrats that the bill would help the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) said he continues “to have real concerns about the Medicaid policies in this bill, especially those that impact drug treatment at a time when Ohio is facing an opioid epidemic.”  Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) made a similar point, saying, “I recognize that many West Virginians rely on health coverage and access to substance abuse treatment because of my state’s decision to expand coverage through Medicaid.” And if Trump and GOP leadership were to try to put some of the safety net spending back into the bill, they'd likely run into opposition from senators such as Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, who are balking at the bill on the grounds that it maintains too much of the Affordable Care Act's coverage outreach. The rest of Trump’s economic agenda is now sitting on the runway, idling, as the health care bill remains bogged down. Trump had a much more populist message with his plan to overhaul the tax code, because though the bulk of the benefits would go to high-earners, the plan as Trump promises would include rate cuts for virtually everyone. The White House and top lawmakers continue to meet and discuss ways to restructure the tax code, but they have not been able to reach an agreement on key ideas, such as whether the proposal would increase the deficit or be offset by the elimination of tax breaks. And his goal of creating $1 trillion in new infrastructure projects also has a populist flair. But negotiations on this plan have also been sidelined. Republicans can't agree, for example, how to finance the construction of new roads and bridges. Trump has floated the idea of packaging the infrastructure plan with the tax cuts, but some top advisers have dismissed this ideas as well. And Congress is expected to try sometime next month to debate ways to raise the debt ceiling, another issue that could unleash a populist backlash, particularly among conservatives. None of these negotiations has produced a concrete proposal so far in part because the repeated false starts on the health care bill have upended Trump’s entire political approach. Republicans had hoped that the Affordable Care Act’s struggles would help them mobilize broad support for a repeal of the law, but they have struggled to sell their replacement plan amid the populist backlash. CBO’s assessment that, in many cases, both premiums and deductibles would go up made things only worse. Trump, who doesn’t have as much access to his base of voters as he did during the campaign, is now hearing from lawmakers — both conservative and centrist — who are willing to stand up to him because the backlash for going along with the Senate bill could be severe in their states. A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that just 17 percent of Americans support the Senate health care bill and 55 percent disapprove. Passing changes to government health care programs is politically perilous, and the Affordable Care Act faltered numerous times before it was eventually signed into law. Some of the reluctant Republicans have given Trump signals about what it will take to win their support, suggesting that adding money back into the Medicaid program could be enough to mollify their concerns. For Trump — and the Republicans — to revive this bill, they need to tap back into the populism that helped him win office in November. But, as of now, the populist wave isn’t on their side. "
20 reasons the GOP crashed and burned on health care,"Republicans’ inability to pass health-care legislation comes as no surprise to those who have watched the party descend into know-nothingism. They hope to get by on a mixture of brain-numbing catchphrases designed to dupe the masses and far-right ideology at odds with the views of Americans, even those within the GOP. Fortunately, that’s not a recipe for successful governance. Let’s recall 20 reasons the GOP’s health-care effort went down in flames. 1. Republicans saw polling show Obamacare was unpopular as a sign that people wanted less government. In fact, polls show that having seen what a post-Obamacare world would look like, they overwhelmingly want to keep it — or make the benefits more generous. Each time Republicans argued that taking away health care was equivalent to “freedom,” they lost another few percentage points of support. 2. No section of the electorate, not even Republicans, thinks Medicaid cuts are a good idea. Using this as an opportunity to whack Medicaid — starving it of resources — was misguided. GOP promises that they were improving Medicaid were hollow and unbelievable. 3. Taking benefits away from people to give tax cuts to the rich is a dream target for Democrats. 4. President Trump’s campaign rhetoric made it sound as though the GOP was going to give more and take away nothing in health-care reform. When Republicans did the opposite, they made Trump into a liar and alienated his base. 5. The White House assumption that it could delegate health-care reform to the GOP leaders who do not share Trump’s populist outlook was dumb. 6. The notion that you can run a White House without experienced insiders reflected a fundamental lack of understanding about what the president does. 7. Trump seemed to believe that bucking up his base has been productive (by attacking the media, for example). It did nothing to win votes in Congress or to keep independents on his side. His ego compels him to do things unrelated to or damaging to governing. 8.  Ironically, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), the lover of Senate tradition, should have known that you cannot order senators around like House members. Threaten them or put them on deadline — and they will revolt. 9.  Many Republican lawmakers — I know this is cringe-worthy — likely didn’t realize that Medicaid serves lots of people other than unemployed, poor people. They grossly misjudged the damage that Medicaid cuts would do. 10. The entire notion of creating a “free market” for health care is off-base. Government — via Medicaid, Medicare and requirements to treat all urgent-care patients — has already big-footed the market. Reforms around the edges are possible, but there is no free market for health care and there hasn’t been for 50 years or so. (Even at the state level, strict insurance regulations do not allow insurance companies to operate like other private businesses.) 11. Republicans seemed to forget that people fear change, especially when it comes to health care. 12. Republicans on Capitol Hill never enlisted GOP governors who are far more influential and popular than they are. Governors are not going to stand idly by while Congress wrecks their states’ finances. 13. They should have done infrastructure first. 14. Rolling out a half-baked tax plan with supersize cuts for the rich only intensified the perception that the GOP cares only about tax cuts for the rich. 15.  The idea that taking people off Medicaid wouldn’t cause suffering because they could buy insurance was economically questionable and politically untenable. If your income is so low as to qualify for Medicaid, you cannot afford the premiums and/or the big deductibles (if you choose a plan with lower premiums). 16. Plotting in secret never works, especially when the people in the room have a poor grasp of health-care economics. 17. Republicans intentionally exaggerated the problems with the exchanges, assuming that alone would make anything they proposed acceptable. 18. Claiming Democrats only wanted single-payer health care didn’t match reality. They are fighting to keep Obamacare, which isn’t single-payer health care. (A segment of the Democratic Party certainly wants single-payer health care, but for now that is not what they are advocating.) 19. Standing up for “hardworking taxpayers” could not disguise the fact that the overwhelming amount of tax relief was going to the richest Americans. 20. You cannot pass major legislation with a policy-illiterate president who cannot explain what’s in it and therefore cannot persuade voters and lawmakers of its merits. Am I surprised the GOP crashed and burned? Not in the least. I’m surprised that so many are surprised the party failed.

"Trump isn’t getting away with ineptness, ignorance or anything else","A popular refrain among media cynics and elected Democrats is that President Trump “gets away” with things no other president does. He insults allies and vilifies a free press. He knows little about what’s in the bills that he declares “great,” and he picks utterly unqualified people who predictably fail to perform well. But in what sense is he “getting away” with outrageous, inept and ignorant governance? His major legislative promises have gone unfulfilled. His wall isn’t being built, his Muslim ban is partially on hold and his international image is toxic. A growing majority of the public disapproves — really disapproves — of his performance. In the latest NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, his approval rating has plunged to 37 percent, while his disapproval rating is up to 51 percent: Forty percent of those polled strongly disapprove of Trump’s performance, twice the 20 percent who strongly approved. The most pronounced swing the poll found was among independents. . . . In February, 40 percent of independents said they approved of the job Trump was doing, with 51 percent disapproving. Four months later in June, just 31 percent say they approve of the president with 59 percent of independents disapproving — a 17 point net-negative drop. In other words, his reservoir of support is getting down to the dead-enders who will never abandon him (just as a segment of the American electorate never gave up on Richard Nixon). The reaction of independents, whom Trump was able to attract in the campaign, should concern the GOP. (“Just 31 percent of independents say they have confidence in Trump’s ability to improve the U.S. economy, while 49 percent doubt he can do so. Just three months ago, 44 percent thought Trump could turn around the economy, while 38 percent didn’t — a 24 point swing.”) Republican support is still holding, for now, but that’s not going to win him elections without support from groups he won over in the campaign. As to those key demographics, he’s losing his appeal. (“Only 52 percent of white non-college educated Americans approve of the job he’s doing, though just 37 percent disapprove. Among Americans 60 or older, he’s underwater — 47 percent disapprove, while 43 percent approve.”) In short, he’s not “getting away” with much. A majority of the country opposes him, a direct result of his own behavior and policy choices. While 58 percent say he’s weakened the United States’ position abroad (74 percent of the world agrees) and a majority wants his Muslim ban struck down, “Thirty-three percent of people say he’s done something illegal in regards to his financial dealings, 38 percent say it may be unethical but illegal and 31 percent say he’s done nothing wrong.” And most troubling for his party, the Democrats have a 10-point advantage in the generic polling for 2018, 48 percent to 38 percent. Trump sure isn’t pulling the wool over anyone’s eyes with his health-care plan(s). Only a paltry 17 percent like the Senate health-care bill, and it’s not that they side with the hard-liners who want to dismantle the bill. Sixty-three percent want Obamacare to do more (46 percent) or remain as is (17 percent); only 32 percent say it should be repealed completely (25 percent) or changed to do less (7 percent). Americans give a thumbs-down to Republicans on handling health care (21/65), and a plurality of voters will blame the GOP if Republicans don’t get health-care reform done. Trump, in short, has not convinced Americans that he is doing his job well, or that his health-care plan is fabulous, or that he’s making America great on the world stage, or that the travel ban is a good idea. Sure, a giant claw has not come to pluck him off the stage; in our system, only an election or impeachment can boot him out of office. Speaking of the latter, we do have a special counsel hard at work. If we are waiting for Fox News sycophants to admit defeat, forget it. The Sean Hannitys and Breitbarts are convinced, but that surely cannot be the measure of success. Trump and his cultist followers are not going to admit they are failing, but they are. Presidents need popular consensus and concrete achievements; Trump has neither. That elected Republicans remain caught like deer in the headlights, unable to cross the road or venture back to safe ground, speaks to their own intellectual and moral deficiencies, not Trump’s “success.” And come to think of it, the Senate has recently defied him on Russia sanctions (he is frantic to soften them) and on health care. So what is Trump getting away with, exactly?

The Health 202: There will be dead bodies whichever way the Senate swings on health care,"THE PROGNOSIS Let’s put it this way: There will be dead bodies one way or another, regardless of which way the Senate swings on its health-care bill. After the current bill suffered a spectacular meltdown yesterday, there's a widespread expectation that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will ultimately bring some version of his health-care bill to the floor sometime in the 13 legislative days before August recess -- even if he knows it will fail. It’s not enough for McConnell to tell the GOP base it couldn’t get done, not after seven years of promising otherwise. He’s got to show them with dead bodies on the floor -- a morbid, insider way of describing a measure that can’t get enough votes to pass. “It’s now or never,” Rodney Whitlock, a former longtime health staffer for Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), told The Health 202. The Senate GOP quest to pass a measure replacing big parts of the Affordable Care Act and enacting steep Medicaid spending cuts came to a halt yesterday as senators kept jumping ship, forcing McConnell to suspend his plans for a vote this week and virtually guaranteeing health-care will remain front-and-center on Capitol Hill throughout July. There were glimmers of harmony after the Republicans huddled at the White House yesterday afternoon with President Trump, but it was clear the legislation would still need changes to secure enough votes and that a vote this week is still unlikely. “The president got an opportunity to learn all the various positions on things that we’ve been discussing,” McConnell said after the gathering. “We all agreed that, because the markets are imploding, we need to reach an agreement among ourselves here as soon as possible and then move to the floor after the recess.” If Republicans do pass their health-care bill, it could cause 22 million fewer Americans to have health coverage a decade from now. Some of those people will voluntarily choose to forgo insurance. But others facing serious illnesses will find plans less affordable than under the ACA, fueling dramatic charges by Democrats that more people will die under the GOP approach. A tweet by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.): Let us be clear and this is not trying to be overly dramatic: Thousands of people will die if the Republican health care bill becomes law. From Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.): GOP health plan is heartless. It is brainless. It is cruel. It means more Americans will suffer or die without access to care. #Trumpcare Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said the GOP bill will guarantee that people will die"" ""Will guarantee that people will die."" Dem @RepSpeier on the Senate GOP healthcare bill.https://t.co/o8f6EJPHzD Hillary Clinton called Republicans ""the death party"" if they pass their health-care measure: Forget death panels. If Republicans pass this bill"
How to make sure the Senate’s bill doesn’t come back to life,"Pushing off a vote on the horrible Senate health-care bill (the Better Care Reconciliation Act) is a victory, but not cause for opponents of Trumpcare to let their guard down. They know all too well that the House bill came back from oblivion to pass by a slim 217-213 vote. How do they prevent a repeat? The Post reports that “progressive groups began laying the groundwork to attend senators’ public events, while medical providers and groups representing Americans with chronic illnesses predicted that the bill could leave millions without access to adequate medical care.” That’s not all: CREDO Action, which had organized 45,000 phone calls to Senate offices, planned to increase that number when senators went home. NARAL, Planned Parenthood, MoveOn and Daily Action were organizing their own phone banks, while Indivisible groups were organizing visits — and perhaps sit-ins — at local offices. All of that would supplement under-the-radar but attention-grabbing TV ad campaigns from AARP, Protect Our Care and other progressive and industry groups. The goal, said activists, is to educate voters and break through to local media, which had not often put the development of the Senate bill on front pages or newscasts. Let me start by observing that for a party tearing itself apart after last Tuesday’s special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District (which seems a year ago now), this is a much better place to be. Democrats can keep their base engaged and recapture their message as the party of the working and middle class. A few words of advice may be useful. First, these groups should ignore the hard-line conservatives. They will not be swayed by attacks from liberal groups; indeed, it will stimulate their tribal instincts, prompting them to rally around GOP leadership. It will be up to principled conservatives to hold Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and others to their promise not to create Obamacare-on-the-cheap. Second, they should focus on the senators who did the right thing in opposing an atrocious bill because it hurt their states. Respectful but consistent pressure needs to be applied to remind them that whatever goodies the White House and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) dole out, a bill that reduces subsidies to those in the exchanges (especially older and poorer Americans) and slashes Medicaid will never be acceptable.  Voters should be urged to call, write and meet with the senators to express gratitude and to make clear the voters expect them to stick to their guns. Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) have acted responsibly when presented with the facts, namely the data on how the bill would affect their states. This is a mini-battle in those five states (and perhaps Louisiana as well) where figures and situations applicable to each lawmaker’s state remain uppermost in their minds. The unpopularity of Trump in their states should also be emphasized. Third, governors must get into the game. We’ve seen bipartisan groups of governors come together to raise opposition. Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio have been especially visible. Both publicly and privately they need to cajole their Republican senators not to put partisan loyalty above responsibility to their state constituents. No one should have any doubt that the bill is bad for their states. Governors should also volunteer to take Collins up on her offer to sit down and work out fixes. Perhaps governors can champion one simple principle: We cannot cut Medicaid to give tax cuts to the very rich. That principle should transcend party lines. Fourth, Trumpcare opponents need to present real people who can speak to the hardships that would be visited upon seniors in nursing homes (and their children who would need to help foot the bills), parents of disabled children and the working poor who are on Medicaid. It is also essential to broaden the discussion to the larger population that receives health care from their employers. As the Congressional Budget Office found, “Under current law, the prospect of paying the employer mandate penalty tips the scale for some businesses and causes them to decide to offer health insurance to their employees. Thus, eliminating that penalty would cause some employers to not offer health insurance.” (Emphasis added.) CBO continues: “Similarly, the demand for insurance among employees is greater under current law because some employees want employment-based coverage so that they can avoid paying the individual mandate penalty. Eliminating that penalty would reduce such demand and would cause some employers to not offer coverage or some employees to not enroll in coverage they were offered.” The one thing that can be said about Obamacare is that it essentially did not disturb employer-provided insurance (particularly since the “Cadillac tax” was postponed); Senate Republicans cannot say the same of their bill. Fifth, don’t forget about the senators who were cagey and quiet. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) represents a state with more retirees, some of whom depend on Medicaid for nursing care. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) represents a state that expanded Medicaid. Consider that “total enrollment in expanded Medicaid in Arkansas had reached 324,000 (about 7 percent of them were ‘medically frail’ and are covered by the state’s traditional fee-for-service Medicaid rather than the Private Option). And by December 2016, there were 331,000 people enrolled in the state’s expanded Medicaid. The state’s total Medicaid enrollment (including the newly eligible population as well as people who were already eligible under the previous guidelines) grew by 70 percent from the end of 2013 to December 2016, reaching 948,181.” Voting to cut Medicaid would deal a debilitating blow to his state’s finances. Finally, much as Democrats would like to tout the advantages of Obamacare, we are talking about persuading Republican lawmakers. It’s a dodge for them to shift the discussion to Obamacare’s faults when their own bill is worse. If anything, anti-Trumpcare advocates should be more honest and forthcoming about ways in which Obamacare’s shortcomings can be remedied. Like it or not, the more anti-Trumpcare activists talk about President Barack Obama, the less chance Republican lawmakers opposed to Trumpcare will stick to their guns.

Morning Bits,"Maybe we need a new secretary. “[Secretary of State Rex W.] Tillerson is treating the State Department as if it were a poorly run conglomerate that is in need of an urgent overhaul by a new CEO who is waiting for the management consultants to tell him which lines of business to keep and which to sell. . . . This is bonkers. By refusing to fill senior State Department jobs for a year or more, Tillerson is not just hindering the process of policy formation. He is also reducing his own influence in both the administration and the world as a whole.” It’s a new thing — participatory democracy. “Republican senators hit by calls from voters worried about Obamacare repeal bill.” And it works! The mayor of New Orleans is a promising new face for the Democrats. “[Mitch] Landrieu is a proud Democrat, and most of his members in the Conference [of Mayors] are Democrats. But he doesn’t want to be a leader of The Resistance. He wants to be a leader of The Workaround, or what happens when leaders in government give up waiting on Washington.” If quick, humble corrective action is a new trend, the media will be better off. “In a fantasy world where rationality still had any tangible influence over the public discourse, the fact that CNN took such swift and dramatic action to correct a relatively tiny portion of the overall Russia story, should actually greatly ENHANCE their trustworthiness on this topic.” Google’s new problem: “The European Union fined Google $2.7 billion on Tuesday for giving a leg up to its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results. The fine is the largest penalty the EU has levied against any company in the world to date.” New signs that tax reform will be tough to pass. The swamp speaks up: “Most of New York’s Republican House members warned Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin not to eliminate the state and local tax deduction as part of tax reform, suggesting in a new letter that they might withhold support for a bill if it hurts the residents of their high-tax state. The public airing of their concerns highlights the difficulty that the Trump administration faces in convincing members of Congress to vote to eliminate tax breaks that benefit their constituents in exchange for lower rates.” They could try something new — like passing a bill they don’t have to lie about. “Republicans have taken to arguing that their Medicaid cuts aren’t actually Medicaid cuts because funding for Medicaid still increases — albeit much more slowly under current law (and that, for the record, is a cut). They’ve also taken to pointing to the 28 million Americans who are currently uninsured — ignoring the fact that the CBO says this could nearly double under their law and would almost definite rise substantially, even if the CBO is very wrong. These misleading arguments are tacit admissions that the bill as it stands is a tough pill for members and their constituents to swallow.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The Senate health care bill is proof: Trumpism isn’t populism,"The Senate's health-care bill might be too much for even Marie Antoinette. After all, about the only way it could be more regressive is if it took the cake a certain French queen wanted the poor to eat for dinner and gave it to the rich for dessert. Or, say, cut Medicaid and middle-class health insurance subsidies so much that 22 million fewer people have health insurance — all so that the government could afford to cut the capital gains tax for households making $250,000 or more. Oh, wait. That last one is actually what the Senate bill would do. It really is hard, as 538's Nate Silver put it, to think of anything less populist than the Republican health-care plan. You might be able to say the bank bailouts were, but even that's probably not true. As unfair as it was to give money to the people most responsible for the global financial crisis — and it was on a world-historical scale, especially when they were allowed to pay themselves that money in bonuses — it at least helped prevent what in all likelihood would have been an even bigger meltdown. The only thing worse than how much credit markets seized up before the $800 billion bailout is how much they would have if there hadn't been one. More people would have lost their jobs, loans would have become impossible to come by instead of just mostly so, and they would have stayed that way more than they already have, since it can take a while for new banks to replace the relationships and local knowledge that old ones had. That, at least, is what a professor named Ben Bernanke found was part of the reason the recovery from the Great Depression was as slow as it was. The bailout, in other words, mostly helped Wall Street, but didn't exclusively help it. That's more than you can say for the GOP's health-care plan. Now, there are three ways to think about the Senate bill. The first is that it would take health-care from the poor and middle-class to pay for tax cuts for the rich at a time of already historic inequality. The second is that it would make insurance more expensive for everyone and less useful for anyone who is sick. And the third is that it would hurt President Trump's working-class base the most. Other than that, how were the tax cuts, Mrs. Lincoln? It's really pretty simple. The Senate bill would, over the course of the next decade, cut Obamacare's health insurance subsidies by $408 billion and Medicaid by $772 billion all to pay for $700 billion of tax cuts, nearly half of which the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says would go to the top 1 percent of households. Not only that, but the fact that it would only peg the value of its remaining subsidies to higher-deductible plans means that a lot of people would be pushed into them. They couldn't afford anything else. On an apples-to-apples basis, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that the Senate bill would increase the cost of a “silver” plan that covers 70 percent of expected medical costs by an average of 74 percent over the next three years — and more for the type of older, poorer people who overwhelmingly went for Trump. Although it's actually even worse than that. A 64-year-old making $26,500 would, according to the Congressional Budget Office, see their premiums for a silver plan go from $1,700 under Obamacare to $6,500 under the Senate bill — but it'd be for a silver plan that covered 17 percent less of their expected medical expenses. So they'd be paying more to get less. How much more? Well, the Kaiser Family Foundation calculates that, in the case of our hypothetical 64-year-old, their deductible would go from $809 to $6,105. And it'd be an even bigger jump for people a little bit lower on the income ladder. Someone making just $18,090 would see their deductibles increase from $255 to the same $6,105. The Senate bill, then, would leave a lot of people with a choice between plans they couldn't afford to buy and couldn't afford to use. Or, as the Republicans would call it, freedom! And if you lived in a red state, you would probably get more of it. That's because the Senate bill would let them opt out of “essential health benefits” like mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs — and in the process, the Brookings Institution's Matthew Fiedler points out, bring back annual and lifetime limits on benefits. The result would be a system where healthy people would mostly buy cheaper plans that didn't cover much, and mostly sick people would buy ones that did, you know, cover things — which would only make those more comprehensive plans so expensive that hardly anybody would be able to buy them at all. People would be forced to buy skimpy insurance that might not even insure you if you use too much of it. This isn't a health-care plan that helps you if you need health care. Not when it would give you higher premiums, higher deductibles and worse coverage. No, this is a health-care plan that only helps you if you're wealthy and have a lot of investment income. It would cut the tax on capital gains, interest and dividends from 23.8 to 20 percent for households making $250,000 or more. Other than that, you're out of luck — and maybe out of being insured. Indeed, the CBO estimates that the Senate bill's $1.1 trillion of cuts to health insurance spending would result in 22 million fewer people having insurance in 10 years' time. All so that the top 2 percent of households, who are the only ones really getting ahead in today's economy, can have 2 percent more money after taxes. Let them pay a third of their income in deductibles is the new “Let them eat cake.” "
American health care is a bad case of American exceptionalism,"Want smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions to know? Sign up for the Today's WorldView newsletter.  Washington has been consumed by a furious debate over the Senate’s recently unveiled health-care bill. The measure's opponents — along with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — warn that, if passed, the bill could lead to tens of millions of Americans losing health insurance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had planned to vote on the bill this week. But Senate Republicans, chastened by the uproar from critics and dissent within their own ranks, said Tuesday they would put off voting until after they return from the July 4 holiday recess. In the meantime, it’s worth considering the issue in a more global context. Health care is an essential need in any society. In many places, in both the developed and developing world, governments play active roles in providing care, lowering costs, or both. No country has the exact system as the other, nor is any country’s system free of critics and detractors. But you’d be hard-pressed to find any other wealthy nation in the world where the very idea of universal coverage provokes such partisan division. The Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare, was an effort to expand health insurance coverage to millions who would otherwise be too poor to pay for it — or too sick to afford what insurers may charge. (Its precursor, of sorts, was implemented by a Republican governor in his state.) But most Europeans would look at the power still given to private insurance companies, as well as the high costs many Americans still shoulder, and consider Obamacare to be a centrist, if not center-right, political compromise. Indeed, the ideas at the core of Obamacare were ones long championed by conservative health-policy wonks. Yet many Republicans viewed Obamacare as a tyrannical “socialist” plan to force people to pay for insurance they didn’t necessarily want. For years, Republican politicians have espoused the principle of “personal responsibility” — the supposition being that if you want health care, you’ll get employment and do what’s needed to afford it. The free market, they argued, would naturally provide sufficient options — never mind the various ways insurance companies placed ceilings on coverage or punished those with preexisting conditions. Before summer’s out, we'll repeal/replace Obamacare w/ system based on personal responsibility, free-market competition & state-based reform pic.twitter.com/JzCyxX9kJb — Mike Pence (@mike_pence) June 24, 2017  The “free-market competition” espoused by Vice President Pence in the tweet above has led to spiraling costs in a medical system run mostly by for-profit companies and hospitals. According to OECD data — indicators for a bloc of developed countries — the United States spends close to 20 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, nearly $10,000 per person, roughly twice as much as countries like Britain, which has a nationalized health service. Americans, as a whole, pay more to get less. “It is not just that U.S. healthcare is expensive, with price tags often far higher than those in other developed countries,” wrote Elisabeth Rosenthal, editor in chief of Kaiser Health News. “At this point, Americans face astronomical prices that quite simply defy the laws of economics and . . . of decency and common sense.” She goes on: “Our prices for tests, drugs, hospitalizations and procedures — old or new — have gone up dramatically year by year, and are vastly higher than in other developed countries. Indeed, prices for similar interventions in other countries have often declined.” What explains the difference? Some observers point to a cultural gap between Americans and those across the Atlantic. A 2011 Pew survey found that Americans tended to value individual liberty more than Europeans, who saw a positive role for the state. “Nearly six-in-ten in the U.S. (58 percent) believe allowing everyone to pursue their life’s goals without interference from the state is more important,” noted the report. “Majorities in all European nations polled in 2011 said guaranteeing that nobody is in need is more important.” But this kind of American exceptionalism would be a lazy answer. Just north of the border, you have an English-speaking society that embraces its own pioneer myths of hard work and self-reliance on the frontier, but which also has a health-care system that seeks to provide universal coverage. “Single-payer systems, like the Canadian version, or a single provider system, as seen in the United Kingdom and other countries, provides the means of bringing care under the umbrella of a single, accountable authority,” explained two Canada-based doctors in an article for STAT News, a health-care news site. “This is neither socialism nor an attack on individual liberty. It is simply making a promise: to protect each other from disease and preventable harm, recognizing that our capacity to do so is perhaps the most meaningful measure we have of our society’s worth.” Health care is a human right. — Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) June 26, 2017  The profound unpopularity so far of the GOP-proposed replacements to Obamacare show that many Americans also want a system that better ensures the collective well-being of their society. But the fact that it doesn’t yet exist is also a reflection of unhealed divisions in American society. In an article in the Atlantic, Vann Newkirk II points to a forgotten plank of the civil rights movements of the 1960s: access to health care. Various countries in Europe had already instituted universal health-care schemes. But, as Newkirk noted, “America’s developing peculiar, private, decentralized, job-pension-based health-care infrastructure was the only fit for a modernizing society that could not abide black citizens sharing in societal benefits, and one where black workers had often been carved out of the gains of labor entirely.” State-subsidized programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which came into existence a year after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, essentially forced hospitals to see black patients and helped “end formal segregation.” Decades later, Obamacare disproportionately helped expand coverage to people of color. But the new efforts pushed by the Republicans, wrote Newkirk, “will move America away from eliminating racial inequalities in health and health care.” It’s just another unfortunate way the U.S. system may distinguish itself from the rest of the world.

More Republicans announce opposition to health-care bill — only after vote is delayed,"This item has been updated. Now you tell us. Three more Republican senators announced opposition to the Senate’s health-care bill on Tuesday — but only after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) announced he will delay a vote to begin debating the legislation. News of the delay came at approximately 12:45 p.m., and McConnell explained his decision to reporters less two hours later. That was around the time that Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) announced that he would have voted against beginning debate on the bill. The Senate healthcare bill missed the mark for Kansans and therefore did not have my support. — Jerry Moran (@JerryMoran) June 27, 2017  In a subsequent tweet, Moran said that “now is the time to take a step back and put the full legislative process to work.” At 3:54 p.m. — more than three hours after news leaked of the bill’s delay — Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) joined the bandwagon. The duo has been negotiating for more federal funding to help combat opioid addiction, an epidemic especially ravaging their home states. The bill “includes some promising changes to reduce premiums in the individual insurance market, but I continue to have real concerns about the Medicaid policies in this bill, especially those that impact drug treatment at a time when Ohio is facing an opioid epidemic,” Portman said. Capito added that “this bill will not ensure access to affordable health care in West Virginia, does not do enough to combat the opioid epidemic that is devastating my state, cuts traditional Medicaid too deeply and harms rural health-care providers.” So why the delay? A spokesman for Moran said that the senator’s opposition would have been made known before the vote, if one had been scheduled, and that the decision to delay a vote didn’t factor into his announcement. In a statement last week, Moran made clear that “If this bill isn’t good for Kansas, it isn’t good for me” — a broad statement designed to keep the door open either way. Portman and Capito, who have been working on finding more funding to combat opioid addiction for months, were in talks Tuesday to make their opposition known before McConnell’s announcement and didn’t realize he was going to announce his intentions during the weekly GOP luncheon, according to aides to the senators who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the deliberations. Both camps said it was still important to express their opposition. With Capito, Moran and Portman now opposed to the bill, at least nine Republican senators are on the record as being against the legislation in its current form. The six other senators — Susan Collins (R-Maine), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Dean Heller (R-Nev.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) — all announced their intentions before McConnell’s decision.

"A mother’s response to the health-care debate: Her 3-year-old son’s $231,000 hospital bill","Alison Chandra's unborn son faced daunting odds of making it to his first birthday. And keeping him alive meant risky, expensive surgeries that their small family couldn't afford. Still, Chandra admits, she felt a bit of shame as she walked into the welfare office. “I remember sitting across the desk from the woman in the office,” Chandra told The Washington Post. “She said it’s going to be okay. And I just — I think I hugged her. It was the first time that someone was able to tell me that something in this whole nightmare was going to be okay. “There was a safety net and I was falling into it.” At a prenatal sonogram, Chandra and her husband learned that they were having a boy, and that he had a rare disorder called heterotaxy syndrome. He was born with nine heart defects, two left lungs and five spleens “of dubious function,” Chandra said. His liver and gallbladder are down the middle of his body, along with his heart, which needs a pacemaker to pump. [No, the government did not pay for Mitch McConnell’s polio care. Charity did.] Ethan's third birthday is Saturday, but he's been through four open-chest surgeries. They've cost millions, Chandra estimates, and almost all of his early care was paid for by Obamacare. Even though the family is no longer relying on Obamacare, his mother says her son is the poster child for Obamacare. And she's using his story as a message to Republicans attempting to change the health-care law. Senate Republican leaders are trying to overhaul the 2010 Affordable Care Act and pass a new health-care bill, though they are facing opposition from the conservative and moderate wings of the party. Senate leaders announced on Tuesday that they'd postponed a vote on the legislation until after the July 4 recess. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts that the bill would cause about 22 million more Americans to be uninsured in the next decade. That number is just over a million fewer than the CBO estimate on the House version of the bill, which was passed hastily last month. As the debate rages, the picture Chandra tweeted of her son's adorable face, surgery scar and protruding pacemaker has rocketed around the Internet, along with its potent message: “Look my son in the eyes and tell him that he's fought so hard to be here but sorry, you're just not worth it anymore,” she tweeted. “I dare you.” And on Friday, she posted another image: Her son's $231,000 hospital bill from his recent heart surgery. It seems fitting that, with the #TrumpCare debate raging, I got this bill in the mail today from Ethan's most recent open heart surgery. pic.twitter.com/pyUE2UxbWW — Ali (@aliranger29) June 24, 2017  She's transparent in what she's trying to do: Put a cuddly human face on a debate about health care that she believes is filled with cost-benefit analyses and shouting. She hopes their story helps people on both sides of the debate “just quiet down a little bit and look at each other. Come over to my house and spend the day with us and just look at my kid. He’s more than just a hospital bill. He's more than his preexisting condition.” Obamacare isn't perfect, she concedes, but it's given her nearly three years with her son, who has developed an intense obsession with animals and is looking forward to a moose-themed birthday party Saturday. It seems like our kids are being reduced to a line in a budget."" For this mom"
McConnell throws in the towel — for now,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) bowed to reality and announced the health-care bill, widely panned in the wake of the Congressional Budget Office scoring, won’t be voted on this week. He says he’ll use time over the recess to gain support for the bill. With ideologically diverse members — from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) — opposing even moving forward on the bill, McConnell said he would delay the bill until after the recess. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) certainly played a critical role in simply refusing to be rushed, a very Senate-like defense of good governance. McConnell made the announcement before a meeting this afternoon with the president, who wanted to persuade senators to get on board. (Was McConnell saving the president the embarrassment of failing to sway senators or publicly advertising Trump has no leverage with his members?) The question is: What would change after the recess? The formulation that the House and Senate embraced — big Medicaid cuts, giant tax cuts for the rich and skimpier support for non-elderly, able-bodied adults — is a loser from both a policy and political standpoint. The CBO report was simply the nail in the coffin, but a batch of senators, to their credit, slowed down the train and then dug in. Unlike House members, they refused to be goaded into taking a rushed vote on an awful piece of legislation. McConnell can cajole, horse trade and offer backroom deals galore, but the basic formulation set out in the House and Senate bills is destined to fail. Neither the hard-right nor moderates can embrace it. President Trump, it seems, finally brought the GOP (at least in the Senate) together. These questions remain: 1. Will McConnell ever take a vote, or will tax cuts (the big ones in the IRS code), the budget and the debt ceiling take center stage now? 2. Does McConnell pay a price — or get a hearty round of applause — from  members? He didn’t force anyone to vote, and he let the bill hang out there long enough for it to become clear how ill-conceived was the compromise legislation. A leader of a hopelessly divided caucus would try, as we have said, to rip the bandage off as quickly as possible. That’s what he did. 3. Does McConnell make an effort to save the bill by, for example, separating out Medicaid “reform” and leaving that for another day? Or does that merely expose many Republicans’ true intent — cut Medicaid and give the rich tax cuts. 4. If McConnell cannot get the votes for a half-baked “repeal-and-replace” bill, would he take up the offer by Collins to try to fix the exchanges, in essence forging a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans? Could he convince Trump such an effort could be counted as a “win” for the president? (Hey, if Trump can construe the per curium order from the Supreme Court staying only part of the Muslim ban as a “unanimous decision,” anything is possible.) 5. Taking just the exchange side of the equation (not Medicaid, not tax cuts), could McConnell pull out a deregulation bill that frees up insurers to offer all sorts of plans and/or removes the subsidies (a more coherent, “true” repeal), or would there be enough moderates to block such an effort? And would the bill then survive back in the House? 6. Do Republicans get praised or vilified by the Trumpian echo chamber for killing a bad bill? We’ll have to stay tuned to see how these and other queries get answered.

"A health-care debacle, just before the 2020 elections","You have to hand it to Republicans. When they get it into their heads to do something stupid, there is no holding them back. One of the clever aspects of the Affordable Care Act was to avoid big, disruptive health-care changes right before an election. Not so with Republicans’ bill. The Kaiser Family Research Foundation reports: Overall, marketplace enrollees would pay on average 74 percent more towards the premium for a benchmark silver plan in 2020 under the BCRA [Better Care Reconciliation Act] than under current law. Younger enrollees would see modest increases on average (10 percent for those under age 18; 17 percent for those ages 18 to 34), while average premiums would more than double for enrollees ages 55 to 64. … Marketplace enrollees with incomes below 200 percent of poverty would see an average increase in their premium costs of 177 percent, while higher income enrollees would see an increase of 57 percent.” There is not a single age group that would pay less under the Senate bill for the Silver plan than they do under the ACA. Those 55-64 years old have the biggest hike — 115 percent. Likewise, all income brackets will pay more. Once again Americans age 55-64 yrs. old get hit the worst, that is older poorer people. They get a 294% increase. It was as if they set out to create a bill unpalatable to every one and devastating to Trump’s base. It doesn’t get much better if Americans drop down to the Bronze Plan. That isn’t much help to older Americans or to those who want to pay less out-of-pocket. For younger marketplace enrollees, they generally would pay less under the BCRA to purchase a bronze level plan than they would pay for a silver plan under current law; older enrollees, however, generally would pay more for a bronze level plan under the BCRA than they would pay for a silver plan under current law. Moving down to bronze level plans, however, would expose enrollees to much higher cost sharing than in silver plans, and for many enrollees who now receive cost-sharing subsidies, the increases would be very large. The BCRA would eliminate the cost sharing subsidies provided under current law beginning in 2020. And yes, all of this happens in 2020, when the presidency, one-third of the Senate seats and all House seats will be up for grabs. It is almost as if Democrats devised legislation most likely to flip all three to Democratic control. How did Republicans manage to come up with a bill that so adversely affects so many? (And let’s not forget those who won’t have Medicaid or will have reduced benefits.) The reason is simple: If you want to “shrink government” and give the rich jumbo tax cuts, you will wind up with cruddier health-care insurance for just about everyone else. Conservative “reformers” who have been praising the GOP should identify and explain themselves. Are they ideologically opposed to government support for health care, or do they simply have limited options given Republicans’ insistence on tax cuts for the rich? If it is the former, they should have the courage to defend their thinking rather than falsely claim that no one will be worse off. If it is the tax cuts, the so-called reformers on the right should re-label themselves as tax-cut advocates. They sure aren’t in the business of looking out for the most vulnerable among us.

"Cecile Richards wonders, ‘If more members of Congress could get pregnant…’","“If more members of Congress could get pregnant, we wouldn’t be having these kinds of fights.” For Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, “these kinds of fights” involve her battling with men fixated solely on abortion services while she is fixated on providing basic health care to communities where usually no other provider exists. “Many of those members of Congress, they’ve never thought about an unintended pregnancy. They’ve never worried about a lump in their breast … and they couldn’t get access to health care,” she said in the latest episode of “Cape Up.” “That’s the lived experience of women in this country. Again, across every geography, income, party line, that’s just women’s story.” LISTEN HERE For more conversations like this, subscribe to “Cape UP” on Apple Podcasts or Stitcher. With all this talk of “defunding Planned Parenthood,” you’d be forgiven for thinking a few things. First, there is no specific line item in the massive federal budget for the organization. “No, absolutely not,” Richards explained. “It’s not like there’s a big Publishers Clearing House check that gets delivered to our office every year.” Second, federal money is not used to pay for abortions. That’s prohibited by law under the Hyde Amendment, except to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest. “Some folks have insurance coverage, although that’s another thing that they’re trying to do, is to end all insurance coverage for abortion services in the U.S.,” Richards said. “Some women pay out of pocket, and some women, relying on funds that we raise at Planned Parenthood to help people who can’t afford services.” Oh, and I bet you didn’t know this little nugget Richards let drop during the interview: Men are the fastest-growing population of clients at Planned Parenthood. “I was actually in San Diego the other day at our health center, and the waiting room was full of men,” she said. “And the TV, instead of being on the soaps, was turned to ESPN, and I said, ‘What’s going on?’ And they said, ‘It’s vasectomy day at Planned Parenthood in San Diego.’ ” [Valerie Jarrett: ‘I’m uncomfortable with men making decisions that affect women’s health.’] Listen to the podcast to hear Richards talk about valuable advice given to her by her late and legendary mother, former Texas governor Ann Richards (D), whether she would follow in her footsteps and run for elective office herself, and her conversation with Ivanka Trump, who wanted to talk about Planned Parenthood — a call that happened before President Trump’s daughter went into the administration. “Since then,” Richards told me, “this administration has done absolutely everything in their power to repeal women’s access to health care.” “Cape Up” is Jonathan’s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.

Do GOP senators have an escape hatch on the awful health-care bill?,"To the surprise of very few who have watched her carefully over the course of her career and have listened intently to her recent statements, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Monday announced (via Twitter): “I want to work w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to fix the flaws in ACA. CBO analysis shows Senate bill won’t do it. I will vote no on [the motion to proceed].” A motion to proceed is essentially the vote to debate and then vote on the merits. Collins is saying that she is not going to vote to begin the debate on a bill so fundamentally flawed. “CBO says 22 million people lose insurance; Medicaid cuts hurt most vulnerable Americans; access to healthcare in rural areas threatened,” she continued. “Senate bill doesn’t fix ACA problems for rural Maine. Our hospitals are already struggling. 1 in 5 Mainers are on Medicaid.” The Congressional Budget Office scoring sealed the deal, perhaps, but Collins didn’t need the CBO to predict that a bill taking $800 billion or so out of Medicaid was going to wallop her state. She became the third official no vote — the others are Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.). Heller, like Collins, can see what the Senate bill would do to his state (which, unlike Maine, did expand Medicaid and therefore has a lot more to lose). Paul sincerely believes that the federal  government shouldn’t be regulating or subsidizing health care for able-bodied, non-elderly Americans. Then, later Monday night, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told CNN’s Dana Bash that he would vote against a motion to proceed. Others who say they need more data — Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), to name two — may be more explicit about voting no on a motion to proceed. Normally, when senators say that they “don’t have enough information,” the political world interprets that as equivalent to ” I am undecided.” But remember — the key vote that could stop the bill even before a vote on the merits would be the “motion to proceed.” Saying that they do not have enough information to vote to proceed puts other senators right where Collins is: “No” on a motion to proceed. To be certain, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is forcing this result by his insistence on voting on the bill later this week. His hurry-up-and-vote gambit was designed to stop opposition from gathering and to maximize pressure on his members to fall into line. But — and here is where one suspects McConnell never does anything to hurt his members — the artificial deadline also gives members who cannot vote for the bill on the merits an easy way out. They simply say, “That McConnell wouldn’t give us enough time. Darn!” Some voters will see this as nothing more than a no vote on the Senate bill (for better or worse); others will give their senator a break for refusing to be rushed into a ill-considered debate. And if McConnell after the July 4 recess decides to move on to other things, senators may never get around to a health-care vote. Even President Trump sounded as though he might be looking for a way out. On Monday, he tweeted, “Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash & burn!” That suggests he would give Republicans an alternative to passing the bill (let Obamacare “crash and burn”) and be amenable to blaming Democrats, who of course have no ability to stop Republicans if the latter even had 50 votes (plus the tiebreaker from the vice president). Perhaps McConnell does force a vote. Maybe all the tough-talking senators in the end crumble. But if so, they have left a trail of embarrassing and self-incriminating statements a mile long, which future opponents will use against them. Candidly, they sure are acting as though they want to get out of this and go home. If they do, critics of Trumpcare will owe Collins a huge debt of gratitude.

Three ways to make the Senate bill better — and make it disappear,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) decried the Senate Republicans’ health-care bill on Monday afternoon, citing the Congressional Budget Office’s score showing millions would lose health care (including older, poorer seniors who would get priced out of the market) and others would pay more out-of-pocket. “This week, the Senate will witness a political exercise: the majority leader will attempt to coerce the votes of these senators and any other holdouts by adjusting the dials on the legislation a bit,” Schumer said. He added, “No matter how the bill changes around the edges, it is fundamentally flawed at its center. No matter what last minute amendments are offered, this bill will force millions of Americans to spend more of their paychecks on health care to receive fewer benefits simply so the wealthiest Americans pay less in taxes.” Well could the bill be improved? Let’s see if  three simple changes would help. First, leave out the tax cuts; they are needed to fund whatever replaces Obamacare. The House and Senate bills give less help to Americans and skimpier coverage because they no longer have the funding source. Second, instead of massive rollbacks in Medicaid funding, tell governors Medicaid funding will continue and they will have more freedom to control delivery of services and how they are structured. They will need to cover the same population groups, but if they have ways to do so more efficiently have at it! States could even impose reasonable work (or work-training) requirements for able-bodied, non-seniors. (Keep in mind 80 percent of Medicaid recipients have a working person in the household.) Consider how this might be combined with expansion of the earned income tax credit to subsidize wages of those who do have jobs. Third, for the first two years Republicans are willing to prop up the exchanges. As the Kaiser Family Foundation explains, the bill includes, “federal funding of $115 billion over 9 years available to all states, and additional funding of $8 billion over 5 years for states that elect community rating waivers. States may use funds to provide financial help to high-risk individuals, promote access to preventive services, provide cost sharing subsidies, and for other purposes.” The federal government will continue to pay for the cost-sharing subsidies which keep costs low for poorer Americans. This gives the Congress two years to diagnose and fix the exchanges to try to keep insurers in the exchanges and curtail premium increases. They can bring in governors, doctors, insurers, actuaries — you know, actually legislate to fix concrete programs. They could take Democrats up on their offer to discuss how the exchanges could be improved. Well, yes, this would be an entirely different sort of bill. It wouldn’t seek to extract billions from the health-care system to put back into the pockets of the super-rich. It would allow for Medicaid reform, without eviscerating the program. And it would set out a deliberate, serious process for fixing what Republicans said couldn’t be fixed, but are managing to fix for at least two years. The two-year period would have one more advantage: Obamacare defenders say we have experienced a one-time glitch, a spike in premiums. Let’s test that by seeing whether premium costs level off. Republicans — excluding Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who on Monday announced she is a “no” on the Senate bill and said she wants to “fix” the ACA — have no interest in such a bill, of course. They’re in it for the tax cuts and for a massive reduction in the federal government’s responsibility for health care for the poor, disabled and nursing-home-bound seniors. But that’s not repealing Obamacare, you say. True, but neither does the Senate bill. The difference is that the Senate bill leaves people worse off.

The Health 202: CBO score of Senate health bill certainly doesn't ease McConnell's path to 50,"THE PROGNOSIS Expect lots of tinkering of the Senate health-care bill in the next few days as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tries to fine-tune his Obamacare overhaul to garner enough votes for passage later this week. The road to success looks steeper than ever as senators appear to dig in against it. Yet McConnell built some spending wiggle room into his legislation, giving him some leeway to bulk up its benefits as a way of gaining more political traction should he need it. The numbers from the Congressional Budget Office rolled out yesterday: Twenty-two million more people would be uninsured by 2026 under the Senate GOP health-care bill, Congress' official scorekeeper estimated. It's a big number, one that certainly doesn't ease the pathway toward the 50 Republican votes needed to pass the Better Care Reconciliation Act. (Check out our whip count for updates all week long.) The release of the 49-page ­report late Monday afternoon seemed to worsen the bill’s prospects"
Morning Bits,"An apt turn of phrase: “The American Medical Association (AMA) wrote a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) warning against cuts to Medicaid and changes to ObamaCare’s subsidies and regulations. ‘Medicine has long operated under the precept of Primum non nocere, or ‘first, do no harm.’ The draft legislation violates that standard on many levels,’ AMA Executive Vice President and CEO James Madara wrote in the letter.” This might not be the right time for Republicans to take away people’s health-care coverage. “With the recent release of the Senate’s version of a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Democrats — who control neither Congress nor the presidency — now have an opportunity to capitalize on Americans’ perceptions that they are better at handling healthcare policy as they attempt to defeat the GOP legislation and preserve Obamacare. Democrats’ 19-point advantage on healthcare underscores the difficulty Republicans might have in convincing Americans to support their legislation.” A fitting stance for an up-and-coming Democratic mayor. “President Donald Trump has it all wrong, said New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, making his inaugural speech as the president of the non-partisan United States Conference of Mayors. ‘America’s greatness is alive and well in cities and towns across this country—from urban to rural to suburban, from coast to coast,’ Landrieu said, speaking to a ballroom full of mayors from around the country.” This would not be considered proper in any other administration. “One month before Election Day, Jared Kushner’s real estate company finalized a $285 million loan as part of a refinancing package for its property near Times Square in Manhattan. The loan came at a critical moment. Kushner was playing a key role in the presidential campaign of his father-in-law, Donald Trump. The lender, Deutsche Bank, was negotiating to settle a federal mortgage fraud case and charges from New York state regulators that it aided a possible Russian money-laundering scheme. The cases were settled in December and January.” Yikes. This seems like the correct way to go. “The leaders of the bipartisan National Governors Association are asking Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to give states more time to read and analyze the impact of the Senate’s healthcare bill before holding a vote on the proposal.” If they don’t get it, they should push their senators to vote no. It may not be appropriate even to consider the merits of the travel ban “because the ban was initially intended to be a 90-day stopgap while the administration devised a new immigration policy, actually the whole question could be moot by the time the Court gets its chance to review it. Indeed, since the revised ban was issued on March 16, the Court signaled that it already expired on June 14.” We do not have a budget suitable for the burdens placed on the military. “If Congress will not find a way out of the dysfunctionality of sequestration—and the unwillingness to compromise that triggers it—the only other way to bring our requirements into line with our spending is to reduce those requirements. If Congress won’t provide adequate funding, it should at least provide guidance to the administration about which obligations we have undertaken for our security that we as a country should pare back. Where should the administration accept greater risk? Maybe instead of producing an ‘unfunded requirements’ list, the secretary of defense should write his strategy in incremental spending thresholds that show what would have to be sacrificed in order for DOD to have confidence it could meet the strategy’s requirements. That way, Congress could choose the nation’s fate by choosing its level of spending.” Read the whole thing.

"The Daily 202: Thwarted in Washington, the Koch network racks up conservative victories in the states","With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: COLORADO SPRINGS—The wealthy donors who finance the Koch network are frustrated that national Republicans are not doing more to capitalize on having unified control of the federal government. But at their summer seminar here in the Rocky Mountains, which wrapped up last night, many were ecstatic—even giddy—about significant conservative gains that have been made this year in state capitals across the country. Republicans now control the governorship and legislature in 25 states, compared to only six states for Democrats. Last November, the GOP seized all the levers of lawmaking in four new states – Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri and New Hampshire – making it much easier to pass far-reaching legislation. The network, led by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on low-profile races and building out grassroots operations in 36 states over the past decade. In 2017 alone, several of these states have reduced union power, scaled back regulations, cut taxes, blocked Medicaid expansion, promoted alternatives to public education, loosened criminal sentencing laws and eased requirements to get occupational licenses. Because President Trump is such an all-consuming story, most of these moves received scant national attention. But the 400 donors who descended on the Broadmoor resort over the past few days have been paying close attention and are keenly interested in the outcome of these state-level fights. “Even in the past six months we’ve seen a lot of success: We have two new right-to-work states, school choice wins in five states, and a dozen states have reduced spending or taxes,” Roger Pattison, director of member relations for the Koch network, said at a dinner on Saturday night. “I could go on and on.” “We’re coming off the most successful legislative session that this network has ever had, and it’s a result of your investments,” added Luke Hilgemann, chief executive of Americans for Prosperity, which is part of the constellation of Koch-funded groups. The two introduced a panel with three Republican governors: Eric Greitens of Missouri, Matt Bevin of Kentucky and Greg Abbott of Texas. Each outlined sweeping changes that have been possible in their states because of unified GOP control and urged donors to keep the spigots open. “You have to invest in governors because we’re getting things done,” said Greitens, who took office in January after eight years of a Democratic governor. Bevin pointed out that Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was sitting in the audience. “It’s probably frustrating to him to bang his head against the wall, as it is for others, but the inability to get certain things done … at the national level ultimately requires that we have things happening from the bottom up,” the governor told the crowd. “Your investment at this level … can make a powerful, powerful difference. … This network’s ability to put boots on the ground is transformative for states like Kentucky.” Making the case that recent GOP grains are fragile, Abbott noted that Texas is one of just four states in which Hillary Clinton in 2016 outperformed Barack Obama in 2012. He expressed concern that Clinton carried Harris County, which includes Houston and some of its surrounding suburbs, even though he had won it in 2014. If Democrats win the Lone Star State, he said, they will have a long-term lock on the White House. “A lot of people really take Texas for granted,” said Abbott, who is up for reelection next year. Koch network officials reiterated plans to spend between $300 million to $400 million on policy and politics in the 2018 cycle and said it will probably be in the higher end of that range. A lot of that will go toward state efforts. Since most state legislatures are part-time and have now adjourned for the year, the network is already sketching out ambitious plans to hit the ground running in early 2018. Tim Phillips, the president of AFP, noted that more progress has been made to limit the power of organized labor, which he describes as “worker freedom,” “in the last five years than in the previous five decades.” Bevin and Greitens have both signed right-to-work laws this year, which ban labor unions from collecting mandatory dues from employees they represent in collective bargaining. Six states have now enacted such legislation since 2012, including longtime union strongholds like Wisconsin and Michigan. “Did you think that would have been possible five years ago?” Phillips said. Phillips revealed at a strategy session that the network’s next targets include Ohio, Minnesota and New Hampshire. “I know Washington tends to suck most of the oxygen out of the room … but the untold story is the dramatic policy advancements … at the state level,” he said. “At the state level, we’re seeing a once-in-a-generation renaissance.” Doug Ducey, the former chief executive of Cold Stone Creamery, was a member of the Koch network before he got elected governor of Arizona in 2014. He still attends the seminars. Yesterday he said that a panel during the January conclave in California helped inspire his education agenda for the most recent session. He brought one of the speakers he had heard to Phoenix to meet with state legislators and business leaders. He just signed a bill that makes every school-aged child in his state eligible for an Educational Savings Account, which gives parents flexibility to spend public money on expenses like private school tuition or tutors. Ducey said “healthy competition” from charter schools and other alternatives is making public education better. “I needed the power of the network,” he told donors. Stacy Hock, a philanthropist in Austin and a major donor to the Koch network, helped launch a group last year called Texans for Education Opportunity that is pursuing similar objectives. Abbott, the Texas governor, has called a special session to focus on education, and her group is gearing up. Hock urged other Koch donors to reach out to her if they want to create similar advocacy operations in their home states. “The value of this network cannot be overstated,” she said during a panel on Monday. “Individuals trying to affect policy change at the state level is daunting, but the ability to stand on the shoulders of the giant that is this network to make yourself more impactful and strategic changes the game. It might have taken decades to build such a sophisticated operation, but we had a tremendous impact in just our first session of operation. … Education policy is a dogfight. The entrenched interests are deeply embedded and very protective of their castle.” Finally, the network is pressing states to overhaul their criminal justice systems. Koch groups worked with the Obama administration and a broad coalition last year on a major federal bill to reduce mandatory minimum sentences, among other changes. Jeff Sessions, as a senator from Alabama, was one of the strongest opponents of that effort. Now the attorney general, he recently issued strict new charging guidelines, including for drug crimes. With the pathway to change blocked off for now in Washington, the network is redoubling its efforts in state capitols. During this legislative session, Koch World was closely involved with law-and-order discussions in Louisiana, Michigan, Kentucky, Arizona, Iowa, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Next year officials hope to work in several other states, including Missouri and Florida. “The states are leading the way … That’s where 90 percent of the action is,” said Mark Holden, the general counsel of Koch Industries and chairman of Freedom Partners, a funding arm of the network, in an interview. “Whether the states know it or not, whether the federal government knows it or not, we’re going back to what federalism is all about. The best way to solve an issue is to be proximate to it.” WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- The Congressional Budget Office score of the Senate health-care bill that was published last night and estimated the legislation would leave an additional 22 million Americans without insurance by the end of the coming decade, has threatened the bill’s likelihood of passage. Amy Goldstein and Kelsey Snell report: “By late Monday, several senators and aides appeared nervous and unsure about the path forward. They hedged on the timing of that procedural vote and suggested the workweek could stretch beyond Friday. … Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) signaled that they would vote against starting debate Tuesday on the bill in its current form. A fourth senator, Dean Heller (R-Nev.), had expressed his opposition last week.” -- Mitch McConnell continues to offer amendments to the bill in an attempt to appease reluctant Republicans and get the legislation over the finish line. Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan report on the horse-trading: “Senate leaders worked Monday to modify their plan to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, adding a provision that would penalize consumers for not keeping their plans, by imposing a six-month waiting provision before they could re-enroll. The change, intended to satisfy insurers and minimize the number of Americans who may drop their plans if the bill becomes law, received measured praise from some industry officials but sharp criticism from patient advocates... Other measures"
This is why so many Republicans are ready to ignore public opinion on health care,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and the GOP leadership are scrambling this week to corral 50 out of 52 Republican votes for an historically unpopular health-care bill. Why did so many House Republicans already vote for a bill that large majorities in every state detest? And why are their Senate colleagues considering walking the same plank, given the electoral risk? In our book, “Representing Red and Blue: How the Culture Wars Change the Way Citizens Speak and Politicians Listen,” we find that thumbing one’s nose at public opinion might spell trouble for elected Democrats. But Republicans typically have much less to fear, because most GOP voters don’t expect — or even want — their representatives to follow the public will. Republicans prefer ‘trustee’ representation According to several years of nationally representative survey data, about two-thirds of Americans believe that elected representatives should “try their hardest to give the people what they want.” Remarkably, however, Republican voters are between 20 and 30 points less likely than their Democratic counterparts to agree. Moreover, people represented by a Republican member of Congress are almost 20 percentage points less likely to perceive their member as behaving that way, regardless of their own party identification. [Trump’s travel ban is built on a law meant to ‘protect’ the U.S. from Jews and communists] It’s not as nefarious as it sounds. Republican voters, whether they consciously realize it or not, are more comfortable with what political scientists call “trustee-style representation,” whereby representatives use their own principled judgment when casting votes. In contrast, the “delegate style” binds legislators to constituent demands. Many Republicans — voters and lawmakers alike — cherish their principles more than they do the whims of a mostly uninformed and inattentive mass public. Why the partisan divide? As with so much, the U.S. culture wars drive this partisan representation divide. First, members of groups that comprise the Republican base seem especially averse to delegate-style public overtures. Even after taking account of other forces that might shape citizens’ views of lawmakers, we found that traditionalistic Christians are 23 points less likely than seculars to say that representatives should “give the people what they want.” Instead, they should “stick to their principles, no matter what the polls might say.” Second, those most inclined to favor traditional power relationships in the home or to oppose egalitarian causes are 32 and 29 points less likely, respectively, to respect public opinion in this way. [Is democracy on the decline? Not as much as some pundits want you to believe.] Third, when Republicans think their representatives are getting soft, they try to hold them accountable. In surveys, we asked respondents to tell us not only what kind of representation they wanted but also the kind they thought they were actually getting. Democrats proved 23 points less supportive of their representatives when they perceived them paying too little attention to public opinion. In contrast, Republicans were up to 50 percentage points less supportive when they saw them paying too much attention. Fourth, judging from legislative roll-call data since 1985, Republicans in Congress have been considerably less likely than Democrats to follow their constituents’ policy preferences — a tendency that has grown over time. We found that the ideological convergence between voters and legislators is more than three times greater among Democratic legislators than among Republicans. [This is what Americans will really dislike about the House ‘Trumpcare’ bill] Here’s what that means for the promise to repeal and replace Obamacare These stark partisan differences suggest that Republicans could well buck broad public opinion and vote for an unpopular Senate health-care deal. Granted, polling on the House bill has revealed stronger support among Republicans than Democrats for repealing and replacing Obamacare. But judging from our research, if Republicans were to break their party’s seven years of promises to repeal Obamacare just because the polls have changed, many GOP voters would consider it a rudderless sellout, which could carry greater political risk. [Yes, Mitch McConnell’s secretive lawmaking really is unusual — in these 4 ways] For Republican lawmakers, effective pandering to constituents may have taken on a new meaning: You can charm your constituents by ignoring majority preferences, in devotion to your principles. It remains to be seen whether the Republican Senate will pass its health-care plan this week. But it’s likely to secure the votes of at least 48 of 52 Republicans. And Republicans who vote for it will probably not suffer any meaningful consequence from GOP voters for doing so. David C.

The CBO confirms: Senate Republicans’ health-care bill is a turkey,"The Congressional Budget Office’s highly anticipated scoring of Senate Republicans’ health-care bill was released Monday. To no one’s surprise, it leaves about as many more Americans uninsured (22 million) as the House version (23 million) by 2026; in fact the shock is greater under the Senate’s bill that would prompt 15 million to lose coverage in the first year. The CBO forecast states, “By 2026, an estimated 49 million people would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law.” Make no mistake: This bill is about cutting Medicaid and giving tax cuts to the rich, with health care for everyone else an afterthought. According to the CBO: The largest savings would come from reductions in outlays for Medicaid — spending on the program would decline in 2026 by 26 percent in comparison with what CBO projects under current law — and from changes to the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) subsidies for nongroup health insurance (see Figure 1). Those savings would be partially offset by the effects of other changes to the ACA’s provisions dealing with insurance coverage: additional spending designed to reduce premiums and a reduction in revenues from repealing penalties on employers who do not offer insurance and on people who do not purchase insurance. The largest increases in deficits would come from repealing or modifying tax provisions in the ACA that are not directly related to health insurance coverage, including repealing a surtax on net investment income and repealing annual fees imposed on health insurers. As it did for the House version of the bill, the CBO confirms that the individual insurance market is more stable than the GOP makes it out to be, although “a small number of people live in areas of the country that have limited participation by insurers in the nongroup market under current law.” Under the proposed Senate bill, “the agencies expect that the nongroup market in most areas of the country would continue to be stable in 2020 and later years as well, including in some states that obtain waivers that would not have otherwise done so.” However, there is far more uncertainty for some segments of the population: In the agencies’ assessment, a small fraction of the population resides in areas in which — because of this legislation, at least for some of the years after 2019 — no insurers would participate in the nongroup market or insurance would be offered only with very high premiums. Some sparsely populated areas might have no nongroup insurance offered because the reductions in subsidies would lead fewer people to decide to purchase insurance — and markets with few purchasers are less profitable for insurers. Insurance covering certain services would become more expensive — in some cases, extremely expensive — in some areas because the scope of the EHBs would be narrowed through waivers affecting close to half the population, CBO and JCT expect. In addition, the agencies anticipate that all insurance in the nongroup market would become very expensive for at least a short period of time for a small fraction of the population residing in areas in which states’ implementation of waivers with major changes caused market disruption. In other words, things may be tough for President Trump’s base. Insurance premiums in the short run will rise. And — precisely as critics predicted — the changes in subsidies will bring back high deductible plans, something voters say they do not want. Given limits on out-of-pocket spending and prohibitions on annual and lifetime limits on payments for services within the EHBs, “all plans must pay for most of the cost of high-cost services. To design a plan with an actuarial value of 60 percent or less and pay for those high-cost services, insurers must set high deductibles — that is, the amounts that people pay out of pocket for most types of health care services before insurance makes any contribution.”) This goes to Sen. Rand Paul’s (R-Ky.) point that without looser regulations, insurance companies will need to resort to high deductibles to manage costs. And people will certainly be priced out of the plan: Under this legislation, starting in 2020, the premium for a silver plan would typically be a relatively high percentage of income for low-income people. The deductible for a plan with an actuarial value of 58 percent would be a significantly higher percentage of income — also making such a plan unattractive, but for a different reason. As a result, despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan, CBO and JCT estimate … Some people enrolled in nongroup insurance would experience substantial increases in what they would spend on health care even though benchmark premiums would decline, on average, in 2020 and later years. Because nongroup insurance would pay for a smaller average share of benefits under this legislation, most people purchasing it would have higher out-of-pocket spending on health care than under current law. Out-of-pocket spending would also be affected for the people — close to half the population, CBO and JCT expect — living in states modifying the EHBs using waivers. People who used services or benefits no longer included in the EHBs would experience substantial increases in supplemental premiums or out-of-pocket spending on health care, or would choose to forgo the services. Moreover, the ACA’s ban on annual and lifetime limits on covered benefits would no longer apply to health benefits not defined as essential in a state. As a result, for some benefits that might be removed from a state’s definition of EHBs but that might not be excluded from insurance coverage altogether, some enrollees could see large increases in out-of-pocket spending because annual or lifetime limits would be allowed. Critics of the plan will have a field day pointing out the inequities. (“Premiums for a 64-year old with middle income go from $6,800 under ACA to $20,500 under BCRA.”) Older and poorer people will get hit the worst, according to the CBO. “CBO and JCT expect that this legislation would increase the number of uninsured people substantially. The increase would be disproportionately larger among older people with lower income — particularly people between 50 and 64 years old with income of less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.” The notion that the bill doesn’t cut Medicaid is given the back of the hand. (“Enrollment in Medicaid would be lower throughout the coming decade, with 15 million fewer Medicaid enrollees by 2026 than projected under current law in CBO’s March 2016 baseline … Some of that decline would be among people who are currently eligible for Medicaid benefits, and some would be among people who CBO projects would, under current law, become eligible in the future as additional states adopted the ACA’s option to expand eligibility.”) And finally, the Senate bill may give employers an incentive to drop their group coverage. “Under current law, the prospect of paying the employer mandate penalty tips the scale for some businesses and causes them to decide to offer health insurance to their employees. Thus, eliminating that penalty would cause some employers to not offer health insurance.” As we said, this is not a bill about providing cheaper, better health care to the masses. It’s not about helping older or rural Americans. It’s about taking hundreds of billions of dollars out of Medicaid and giving the money to rich people in the form of tax cuts. The CBO report makes clear what a total disgrace the bill really is.

Happy Hour Roundup,"* Amy Goldstein reports that we have our CBO score on the Senate health care bill, which has been awaited with such anticipation you’d think Beyoncé was giving birth to it: Senate Republicans’ bill to erase major parts of the Affordable Care Act would cause an estimated 22 million more Americans to be uninsured in the coming decade — about 1 million fewer than similar legislation recently passed by the House, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The forecast issued Monday by Congress’s nonpartisan budget scorekeepers also estimates that the Senate measure, drafted in secret mainly by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and aides, would reduce federal spending by $321 billion by 2026 — compared with $119 billion for the House’s version. The CBO’s analysis has been awaited as a crucial piece of evidence as McConnell (Ky.) and other Republican leaders try to hurry a vote on the bill this week. But they are navigating an expanding minefield of resistance from their own party’s moderate and conservative wings, while Democrats are united against it. And it cuts $772 billion from Medicaid, which President Trump promised he would never cut. * Margot Sanger-Katz flags an important nugget from the CBO report: Outside the 10 year window, under the Senate bill Medicaid enrollment would continue to fall relative to current law, as states squeeze their rolls to keep pace with dropping funding. Wait, didn’t Republicans say Trumpcare doesn’t really cut Medicaid? — gs * Robert Barnes reports that the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration a partial victory today: The Supreme Court agreed Monday to allow a limited version of President Trump’s ban on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries to take effect and will consider in the fall the president’s broad powers in immigration matters in a case that raises fundamental issues of national security and religious discrimination. The court made an important exception: It said the ban “may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” In the unsigned opinion, the court said that a foreign national who wants to visit or live with a family member would have such a relationship, and so would students from the designated countries — Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — who were admitted to a U.S. university. Which appears to mean that most of the sorts of people from these countries who were granted visas before will still be able to come. In any case, we’re now safe from terrorism. * Dhruv Khullar and Anupam Jena explain how slashing Medicaid will do enormous damage not just to the recipients who lose coverage but to entire communities. * Benjy Sarlin explains how the Senate’s health care bill, by design, will cause deductibles to skyrocket for millions of Americans. * Francis Wilkinson predicts that the Republicans are going to pass their health care bill because it gives them exactly what they want. * Michael Hiltzik argues that if the GOP bill passes, tens of thousands of Americans per year are going to die. * Jennifer Rubin asks some pointed questions of the GOP senators currently trying to decide if they should support the health care bill. * Jesse Hellman reports that after some delay, the American Medical Association has officially come out in opposition to the GOP bill. Which means it’s opposed by the doctors, the hospitals, the AARP, and pretty much every patient advocacy group. Republicans are hoping to get an endorsement from the Mordor Uruk-hai Association, which says it still has some concerns about the bill. * Rick Hasen says that today’s Supreme Court rulings show that Neil Gorsuch is going to be one of the most conservative justices on the Court. * Leah Litman breaks down what the Court actually decided to do about Trump’s travel ban. * Noah Feldman argues that the Court doesn’t want to render a partisan ruling in the case, but it may have no choice. * And over at the American Prospect, I argued that blatant lying has always been the core Republican strategy whenever health care is being debated.

Why drafting in a vacuum is so dangerous,"Republicans have refused to hold substantive hearings on their health-care bill and to solicit input from relevant groups. In other words, their ideas haven’t been publicly vetted. That leads to some pretty silly proposals. Lacking an individual mandate, the Senate Republicans today added a proposal to impose a six-month waiting period for anyone who allows their health-care coverage to lapse for 63 days or more in the prior year and later decides they need insurance/care. This may not make it through the reconciliation rules, allowing the bill to pass with just 50 votes with a tie-breaking vote by the vice president. The Hill reported, “The addition of the six-month waiting period could make it more difficult to pass the legislation if the Senate parliamentarian rules the provision violates the complex budget reconciliation rules. Republican leadership was working over the weekend to make sure the provision complies with the rules and can be included.” Even if it does make it through the parliamentarian’s scrutiny, the idea is a non-solution. The individual mandate was intended to coerce young, healthy people into buying insurance, thereby helping to pay for older, sicker people in the exchanges. Younger people might avoid buying insurance because they foolishly think they won’t get sick. But if they think they won’t get sick, why would they be persuaded by a penalty that goes into effect when they, um, get sick? Actually, one significant problem with the exchanges is that the mandate was not tough enough. People could move in and out of a plan too easily, thereby avoiding paying into the system and helping to subsidize those older, sicker people. In June 2014 the Congressional Budget Office found that 87 percent of those without insurance could avoid the penalty. “The decrease in the number of people who are projected to pay the penalty largely stems from an increase in CBO and [Joint Tax Committee’s] projection of the number of people who will be exempt from the penalty. That increase is attributable in part to regulations issued since September 2012 by the Departments of Health and Human Services and the Treasury and in part to technical updates and changes in the economic outlook.” In other words, it was too easy to slip in and out of the system. The regulations or “hardship exemptions” seemed reasonable on the surface: The hardship exemption rules, for example, let anyone who “experienced domestic violence” avoid the mandate, without providing any documentation of abuse. Getting a shut-off notice from a utility is also sufficient to claim a hardship exemption. In addition, the law forbids the IRS from using its normal enforcement tools to collect unpaid penalties. Tax experts say the best it can do is withhold the penalty amount from any tax refund due. The incredibly broad exemption from the insurance mandate also threatens to undermine ObamaCare’s market regulations. The law included the mandate as a way to force most people into buying coverage, which would in turn keep premiums down for everyone else. If you can get out of paying or understand you cannot really be forced to pay up, there is much more incentive to game the system. So if you really wanted to prevent the “death spirals” and keep young people in the exchanges to spread the cost from older, sicker people, you would tighten the mandate, not do away with it and come up with a flimsy substitute.

Senate Republicans take one more shot at seniors,"The media and many politicians focus on Medicaid’s support for the poor. That ignores a bigger policy and political problem for states. It’s one thing to cut support for people who Kellyanne Conway thinks need to go out and work (actually, about 80 percent of adults on Medicaid live in a household in which at least one person is employed, which shows how much the White House cares about the topic); it’s another to throw people’s grandparents out of nursing homes. A recent news report explained the scope of the issue: Medicaid pays for about two-thirds of the 1.4 million elderly people in nursing homes. … It covers 20 percent of all Americans, and 40 percent of poor adults. … Under federal law, state Medicaid programs are required to cover nursing home care. But state officials decide how much to pay facilities, and states under budgetary pressure could decrease the amount they are willing to pay or restrict eligibility for coverage. Medicaid pays for about two-thirds of the 1.4 million elderly people in nursing homes. “The states are going to make it harder to qualify medically for needing nursing home care,” predicted Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. “They’d have to be more disabled before they qualify for Medicaid assistance.” States might allow nursing homes to require residents’ families to pay for a portion of their care, she added. Officials could also limit the types of services and days of nursing home care they pay for, as Medicare already does. Many of these elderly people have families who themselves are struggling to make ends meet. If Medicaid support goes down, they’ll need to dip into their own savings. (“A combination of longer life spans and spiraling health care costs has left an estimated 64 percent of the Americans in nursing homes dependent on Medicaid. In Alaska, Mississippi and West Virginia, Medicaid was the primary payer for three-quarters or more of nursing home residents in 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.”) In addition to complaining that the House’s American Health Care Act and the Senate bill would allow insurers to charge seniors up to five times more for premiums than they charge younger people, AARP, unsurprisingly, blasted the Medicaid cuts. “These changes mean less federal money would be available to the states for Medicaid. Starting in 2025, the rate of growth of the per capita cap would decline significantly, meaning even deeper cuts to the program,” AARP said in a statement. “Given the aging demographics of the country, the cap would not keep pace with the funding necessary to support the needs of the senior and disabled population.” That, in turn, means bigger out-of-pocket costs for them or their children and grandchildren. President Trump, of course, had promised to protect all entitlement programs. Not only are many of his voters older, but also his core support is among white, less-educated, working-class voters who are the ones least able to afford new payments to keep up care for elderly relatives — or bring them to live with them instead of at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Howard Bedlin, vice president for public policy and advocacy for the National Council on Aging, blasted the Senate bill for this reason. “In particular, the bill will pull the rug out from under millions of families who are struggling to keep their spouses, parents, and grandparents out of nursing homes.,” he said. “This is because states are required to pay for care in nursing homes, but care at home is optional. Overall, Medicaid covers 2 in 3 nursing home residents and pays for over 60 percent of Americans’ long-term care costs.” Florida has the highest percentage of retirees (19.1 percent), followed by Maine (18.2 percent) and West Virginia (17.8 percent). Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) should consider how they would defend Medicaid cuts back home. Finally, Republicans are taking one more shot at seniors. Recall how big a deal Republicans made about taking more than $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act. Once upon a time (in 2012), now-House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told campaign audiences, “The president raids $716 billion from Medicare to pay for the Obamacare program.” Ryan would even bring his mother out to assure crowds how much he cared about seniors. Both the House and Senate bills do not put that Medicare money back in. Instead, they take a second whack at seniors by depleting funds available for extended care. How does that comport with Republicans’ claim to care about family values and the dignity of every person?

How could any senator justify a vote for a bill this bad?,"The Post reports: There was new talk among key GOP figures about wooing moderates by altering the bill’s Medicaid changes, according to two people involved who would not speak publicly. By tweaking how federal funding is determined for Medicaid recipients and linking aspects to the medical component of the consumer price index, there is a belief that some moderates could be swayed, because they want assurances that funding would keep up with any rises in the cost of care, the people said. Then would come the tightrope: If some senators can be persuaded to support revisions to the Medicaid portion of the bill, several conservatives are warning that unless their amendments are also included, they are unlikely to support the legislation. The hope is that a combination of those Medicaid changes and amendments from conservatives could pave the way to passage. Unless the Senate eviscerates the part of the bill that GOP hard-liners like — cutting Medicaid to pay for big tax cuts — moderates will have a hard time explaining how ending the federal match for Medicaid expansion (even at a slower pace) and providing less money on an inflation-adjusted basis doesn’t violate their promise. It would be one thing if hard-right and moderates had said: We think spending less money or giving states more flexibility is more important than covering everyone who is now guaranteed coverage. But they and President Trump promised “no one” would lose coverage, and there would be “no cuts” to Medicaid. The Senate bill plainly does not meet those ends. Rather than continue to lie about what the bill does and doesn’t do, they should be compelled to make the argument on the merits. What is the argument for taking more than $800 billion out of the Medicaid system in order to spare the super-rich some taxes — before turning to tax reform and driving their tax liability down even further? [The Senate’s three big lies about health care] We have some specific questions for lawmakers who should consider how the bill specifically impacts their states: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): You helped block most payments to insurers going through the risk corridors to compensate for excessive losses. Do you admit that this was a significant reason the exchanges have lost many insurers (in some cases, all of them)? Why would you support a bill now that explicitly makes the very same payments to insurers for two years that you sought to block? Oh, and how many Floridians in nursing homes or assisted-living facilities (AFLs) rely on Medicaid? (I will save him the trouble: “There are 683 licensed nursing homes in Florida, representing approximately 83,587 beds …  [and 3,089 licensed AFL’s in Florida, representing approximately 92,000 beds.] … Medicaid, which covers health care costs for low-income individuals, pays for approximately 60 percent of all long-term care spending.”) Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.): You have rightly pointed to huge premium increases in your state exchange as evidence that Obamacare is not working. But why then turn the bill into a jumbo tax cut for the rich and cut back on Medicaid? Gov. Doug Ducey (R) “wants a slower phase-out of higher Medicaid expansion matches, higher inflation adjustments, elimination of a penalty for states that expanded parts of Medicaid early, and explicit flexibility for the program covering 1.9 million Arizonans.” He says the Senate bill would cost the state $7 billion. (“Currently, approximately 400,000 Arizonans receive coverage through Medicaid. Changes to federal matching payments for the state’s 1.9 million Medicaid recipients would cost $2.9 billion. Limiting inflation adjustments would cost $2.2 billion. Another $2 billion loss would occur when a hospital assessment that pays the state costs of covering 82,000 people in the expanded program and 319,000 childless adults stops. That will happen in 2022 when federal matching rates hit an 80 percent trigger in the 2013 state law authorizing expansion. Raising taxes to replace the money is unlikely in a Republican-controlled state.”) If he’s right, will you vote against the bill? Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and John Kennedy (R-La.): Louisiana belatedly expanded Medicaid. More than 400,000 enrollees were added. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) strongly opposes the Senate health-care bill. It’s easy to see why: “In Fiscal Year 2017, Louisiana has saved an estimated $200 million from expanding Medicaid. In the fiscal year that begins on July 1, 2017, the state is expected to save more than $300 million. Without these savings, K-12 education, higher education and health care would be forced to shoulder deep cuts in the state budget.” Can you explain, senators, how the Senate bill will impact Louisiana residents? Will the state raise taxes to make up revenue it loses from the feds? No, I didn’t think so. [Replacing Obamacare is a make-or-break moment for Republicans] Sens.  Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio): Your states are at or near the top of the list of states with the most opioid-related deaths. At the end of 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data showing that “in 2015, the five states with the highest rates of death due to drug overdose were West Virginia (41.5 per 100,000), New Hampshire (34.3 per 100,000), Kentucky (29.9 per 100,000), Ohio (29.9 per 100,000), and Rhode Island (28.2 per 100,000).” Have you asked your state governor how many fewer people would receive treatment and what that might do to the death rates? (Even if the GOP leaders sweeten the pot by throwing in more money for opioid treatment, you do realize this does not guarantee that sufficient funding will be there, don’t you?) Just three of these senators (two, if you think Sen. Rand Paul is a certain “no”) can stop the bill. They would be wise to tell their colleagues that this is not the time to whack Medicaid. If their colleagues want to talk about repairing the exchanges, the senators should offer whatever ideas they have and invite Democrats to join. But other than lust for revenue for tax cuts, there is no reason to address Medicaid now. On that, a bipartisan commission of governors could come up with a list of proposals (some governors already have). If, however, they allow the party to turn “repair and replace Obamacare” into a raid on Medicaid, affecting the most vulnerable people in their states, they’ll never live it down. Frankly, I don’t know how they could even sleep at night.

"To pass the health-care bill, McConnell has to please two incompatible sides","Senate Democrats and Republicans, both defenders and critics, fanned out on the Sunday shows yesterday. Kellyanne Conway made an appearance, reaffirming the suspicion that the White House doesn’t know what is in the bill or how Medicaid works. (Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price does understand but was not honest in his explanation of the bill.) The open question for the Senate this week, when the Congressional Budget Office score comes out, is whether the opponents of the bill dig in, refusing to go along with a bill that doesn’t repeal the Affordable Care Act but does slash Medicaid (despite what Conway says) and does give gigantic tax cuts to the rich. As for the GOP opponents, they come in two guises. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is the staunchest of the four conservatives (Sen. Mike Lee of Utah apparently hasn’t convinced his colleagues or the media that he is as steadfast as Paul) who oppose Obamacare because they essentially see no role in federally guaranteed health care for non-senior, able-bodied adults. That view is shared by a small percentage of Americans, but it is at least sincere and coherent, unlike defenders of the bill: STEPHANOPOULOS: So, you’re a no right now. You’re a no. PAUL: At this point. But I could vote, if we get to impasse, if we go to a bill that is more repeal and less big government programs, yes, I’ll consider partial repeal. STEPHANOPOULOS: So, that means fewer subsidies? Lower subsidies? PAUL: It means more freedom. It means they have to legalize the sale of inexpensive insurance. Obamacare made it ill legal to buy inexpensive insurance. If I’m a 27-year-old guy, and I don’t want pregnancy coverage, I cannot buy an inexpensive policy. They’ve priced me out of the marketplace. And therefore I don’t buy it at all. And that leads to the whole death spiral of Obamacare. All of that remains under this. And I’m not voting for something that looks just like Obamacare and still doesn’t fix the fundamental flaw of Obamacare. For Paul, uninsured able-bodied adults are part of the “freedom” he envisions. Another wing of Republican opposition comes from Sens. Susan Collins (Maine), Dean Heller (Nev.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). They see massive underfunding of Medicaid over time, withdrawal of funds used to fight opioid abuse and tens of thousands of people who will be priced out of the exchanges and others for whom Medicaid funding will be unavailable. (Sen. Bill Cassidy is supposedly in this camp but sounds a whole lot less emphatic than the others). The Republican senators from Maine, Nevada, West Virginia, Ohio and Alaska face, in some cases, governors adamantly opposed to the bill and in all cases but Alaska, a Democratic senator from their state who will vote against the bill, explaining the suffering and hardship that it will cause in their respective states. Does Collins really want to argue that the Medicaid cutbacks and changes in the exchanges are fine when Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) provides ample evidence to the contrary? Does Portman want to take on his governor and bat down arguments from Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) regarding the number of opioid overdoses that may occur if the bill goes through? The administration, in denying some basic facts, only makes it that much harder for GOP moderates to go along with the president. In an exchange with Stephanopoulos, Conway argued that the Medicaid cuts were not cuts. Stephanopoulos pointed out that she was simply wrong: STEPHANOPOULOS: The president right there said no cuts in Medicaid, had several tweets on that same subject. This bill has more Medicaid cuts than the House bill. Why is the president going back on his promise? CONWAY: These are not cuts to Medicaid, George. This slows the rate for the future and it allows governors more flexibility with Medicaid dollars because they’re closest to the people in need. Medicaid’s imperative, its founding was meant to help the poor, the sick, the needy, the disabled children, some elderly women, particularly pregnant women. We are trying to get Medicaid back to its original moorings. (CROSSTALK) STEPHANOPOULOS: Kellyanne, I don’t see how you can say the more than $800 billion in savings is not cuts. And you don’t have to take my word for it, it’s the Republican senators you’re facing right now who have that problem, led by Senator Dean Heller in Nevada. He said he’s voting no. Also Senator Susan Collins. . . . Is the president prepared to put more money back into Medicaid? CONWAY: The president is prepared to have a conversation, a discussion, a negotiation with those senators and others. I would point out for the few who say that they’re currently a no, you’re talking about 45 or more who are currently yeses. So that tells you something. . . . CONWAY: But let me get back to Medicaid for a second, because I can’t just let it sit there unanswered, George. If you’re currently in Medicaid, if you became a Medicaid recipient through the Obamacare expansion, you’re grandfathered in. We’re talking about in the future. You know, Obamacare took Medicaid, which was designed to help the poor, the needy, the elderly, the sick, the disabled also children, and pregnant women, it took it and it went way above the poverty line and opened it up to many able-bodied Americans who should probably find other — should at least see if there are other options for them. If they’re able-bodied and they want to work, then they’ll have employer-sponsored benefits like you and I do, so… STEPHANOPOULOS: Kellyanne, hold on a second. There’s no way you can say that a 15-year-old on Medicaid today is not going to be affected by the cuts in the future. CONWAY: I didn’t say that. STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, you said everybody who is on Medicaid now is grandfathered in and is not going to face any cuts. And that simply is not factual if you have more than $800 billion in cuts. It also raises the… CONWAY: You keep calling them as cuts. But we don’t see them as cuts. It’s slowing the rate of growth in the future and getting Medicaid back to where it was. Obamacare expanded the pool of Medicaid recipients beyond its original intentions. . . . STEPHANOPOULOS: Again, it’s the Republican senators calling this cuts. It’s the experts calling this cuts. There’s no way you can say… CONWAY: And you know why that is? STEPHANOPOULOS: … $800 billion in savings are not cuts. . . . All of the experts say because of what is being done to Medicaid in this bill that you cannot expand treatment for opioid addiction. Here was the leader of the National Center on Addiction. He says that anyone supporting the Senate bill can’t claim to be addressing the opioid epidemic, the Medicaid cuts will have a devastating impact right there. Also the heads of insurance companies have sent a letter on this saying that four out of 10 people being treated for opioid addiction in the five most affected states, like Ohio, like West Virginia, are getting Medicaid funding. This is going to take that away. Conway went on to tout the infusion of funds (a $123 million addition, compared with the $800 billion in cuts) for fighting opioid abuse. It was a poor argument: STEPHANOPOULOS: [T]he  opioid commission had a hearing and the experts who testified at that commission said that these cuts in Medicaid are going to have a devastating impact. Again, even the Republican senators most affected, Rob Portman in Ohio, Shelley Capito in West Virginia, say you’re going to need to add far more money, $45 billion, to begin to address the opioid addiction problem. This bill doesn’t do that. CONWAY: And George, I would point out that President Obama, through ObamaCare and elsewise, poured money into crises like this and where are we? You can fill up every seat in Yankee Stadium and that accounts for the number of people who died of drug addiction in this country just last year. Thirty-three thousand of whom opioid-related. It’s a gateway to heroin use. . . . And so pouring money into the problem is not only answer. We have to get serious about in-facility treatment and recovery. It… STEPHANOPOULOS: That takes money, Kellyanne. CONWAY: It takes money and it also takes a four letter word called will. It takes the focus that it includes money, but it also includes understanding the difference between just interdiction and prevention, but, also recovery and treatment. I have no idea how “recovery and treatment” without resources cures anyone. And neither does Conway. The Trump team must resort to nonsense and misdirection because it’s very hard to justify how a seven-year effort to repeal and repair the “dying” exchanges became a vehicle to slash Medicaid and give the money back to the super-rich. The bill’s fate will depend on whether Collins (who dismissed Conway’s argument later in the same show), Capito and other “moderates” are willing to be snowed and let their constituents suffer. You’d think it would be an easy no, but don’t bet on it.

Morning Bits,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) actually wants to legislate responsibly. “What I’d like to do is slow the process down, get the information, go through the problem-solving process, actually reduce these premiums that have artificially been driven up because of Obamacare mandates.” Novel idea. If they pass it, Republicans will be responsible for the mess that follows. “I think they have, at best, a 50-50 chance of passing this bill,” Sen. Schumer told ABC News chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. But, the New York Democrat added, the bill “is just devastating. And that’s what’s making it so hard for them to pass it.” No responsible news network would become the president’s mouthpiece. “During today’s broadcast of CNN’s Reliable Sources, host Brian Stelter took aim at one of his network’s competitors, suggesting that they are little more than a propaganda distributor for President Donald Trump. ‘What would a daily infomercial for the Trump presidency look like? Actually, we don’t have to wonder. We have the answer right in front of us. It’s called Fox & Friends,’ Stelter noted at the start of the segment.” No kidding. President Trump in fawning over the regime has responsibility in part for the crackdown. “Police in Istanbul, Turkey, are using plastic bullets, dogs, and some type of smoke to disperse people trying to gather for the city’s annual pride parade, organizers told BuzzFeed News.” Trump says nothing about this despicable persecution. To eliminate irresponsible anti-immigrant hysteria this would be worth a try. “Current law already bars immigrants from receiving many welfare benefits, but states have the authority to spend their own tax revenue on aid for immigrants ineligible under federal rules. As much as this rightly rankles many voters, principles of federalism and the Constitution make it difficult for Congress to ban that practice, except when federal funds are involved. Preventing non-citizens from accessing welfare will save taxpayers money and calm the concerns of many taxpayers. Congress can and should expand upon Trump’s idea to further restrict immigrant welfare use by barring all non-citizens from accessing benefits.” Congress doesn’t want to be responsible for starting a trade war. “Senior lawmakers in both parties are resisting the Trump administration’s moves toward imposing steel tariffs on national security grounds, worried that other countries could use the same argument to block exports from their states.” The Trump team’s gross ignorance — or feigned  ignorance — results in grossly irresponsible legislation. “White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Sunday came right out and said what so many Republicans are probably thinking ― that taking Medicaid away from able-bodied adults is no big deal, because they can go out and find jobs that provide health insurance. Apparently nobody has told Conway that the majority of able-bodied adults on Medicaid already have jobs. The problem is that they work as parking lot attendants and child care workers, manicurists and dishwashers ― in other words, low-paying jobs that typically don’t offer insurance. Take away their Medicaid and they won’t be covered.” Frightful.

Republicans have long dreamed of cutting Medicaid. Trumpcare might really do it.,"As disabled protesters were being dragged, bleeding, from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s office on Thursday after he released his version of Trumpcare, I sat at home working line by line through the 142-page bill. As many have observed, it contains deep cuts to Medicaid, redistributes wealth from the poorest to the richest, and guts all the hard-won protections on preexisting conditions, reproductive care and lifetime spending limits that the Affordable Care Act had brought. What struck me, though, is how familiar all the material on Medicaid looks. Republicans have been trying to gut funding for Medicaid for more than 35 years. The only difference is that this time, they might get away with it. Medicaid is a promise. It promises the most vulnerable Americans that their basic needs for health care and disability-related supports will be met. For many poor and disabled Americans, it offers access to lifesaving health care, which is important enough. For people with disabilities, however, it also offers supports and services that can include wheelchairs, attendants to help people get out of bed or eat, equipment for schools to teach special education, housing in communities instead of institutions, and countless other critical supports. My son, a 10-year-old with Down syndrome, doesn’t need Medicaid yet — but he will. And you or one of your loved ones probably will, too. It’s not a cheap promise, but it’s the kind of thing the richest nation on Earth should do for its citizens. Right now, states run Medicaid programs and pay for part of the costs themselves. But for every dollar of eligible expenditures, they receive $1 to $3 from the federal government (depending on whether it’s a rich state or a poorer state). The budget, in other words, is linked to what it actually costs to help people. Rather than cuts, Medicaid needs more funding, better organization and to be made accessible to more people. The ACA’s Medicaid expansion was a good start, but it wasn’t enough. [For me and my son, Medicaid cuts don’t mean hard choices. They mean life or death.] Since the election of President Ronald Reagan, though, the Republican approach to the promise of Medicaid has been to try to cut off funding by setting an arbitrary limit on costs. Instead of giving states money based on what they actually spend, the federal government would give each state a “block grant” of a fixed amount. They usually characterize this move as calculated to give “flexibility” or “control” to states and preach fiscal prudence — the current Senate bill calls their cuts a “Medicaid Flexibility Program,” for instance. But the bill lawmakers will consider this week undermines that message by tying the shift to block grants to deep tax cuts for the wealthy. As detailed in a 2013 report by the National Council on Disability (a nonpartisan, federally funded advisory council) on Medicaid block grants and their effect on Americans with disabilities, the first attempt to turn Medicaid into a block grant came in 1981, in Reagan’s first year in office. It made it into a big omnibus budget bill, but was stripped out in a congressional committee. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) actually got block grants passed in 1995 as part of his “Medigrant” proposal, but President Bill Clinton vetoed it (with strong backing from health policy experts), and it was dropped from the subsequent compromise bill. President George W. Bush and the Republican congresses of 2003 and 2005 could have passed block grants at any time, but sustained resistance from advocacy groups, Democratic leaders such as Rep. Henry A. Waxman (Calif.) and Edward M. Kennedy (Mass.) and the legislative distractions of forming Medicare’s prescription drug benefit kept the bill from advancing. Moreover, at the time, many Republicans wanted to find bipartisan solutions whenever possible. Henry Claypool, who has been working on Medicaid policy in and out of government since the 1990s, told me that the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 did include some Republican changes to eligibility, but also expanded support for home- and community-based services in ways that have helped many disabled Americans. Today, everything has changed. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) has been proposing block grants since 2010, but he had no chance to get them enacted under President Barack Obama. Now, he and McConnell have co-opted the legislation intended to fulfill GOP promises to “repeal Obamacare” (which would be bad enough) as a way to sneak through decades-long assaults on the basic American promise of Medicaid. This time, the phrasing is “per capita caps.” It’s not exactly the same as block grants, but it’s yet another attempt to use the language of “flexibility” as a way to cut costs significantly. Worse, Claypool said, states have responded to austerity by ending their own state-based Medicaid-like programs. Today, they are totally reliant on federal programs, which now face these deep cuts. History, even wonky policy history, matters. Republicans have been trying to cut the safety net almost since it was first assembled. The current effort has nothing to do with Obamacare in all its complexities, but reflects the near-total capture of the current Republican Congress by its worst elements. With President Trump ready to sign any document put in front of him (even one he thinks is “mean”), the GOP is using the debate over health care to conceal an assault on Medicaid. Republicans must be persuaded to abandon this deception, or the American people should abandon them. Read more: Should healthy people have to pay for chronic conditions?

Selling cruddy health care is harder than you think,"Republicans said they wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare because the exchanges were “broken.” By that they meant deductibles and premiums were too high and insurers were pulling out, leaving fewer choices and less price containment via competition. The Senate bill makes those things worse — taken the minimum actuarial value of the plans from 70 to 58 percent (i.e., the insurer has to pick up less and you have to pick up more of the cost), phasing out subsidies at a lower income point (350 percent vs. 400 percent of the poverty line) and removing the individual mandate, which will increase the adverse selection problem. Obamacare needs fixing alright, but the Senate takes the exchanges in the wrong direction. Sure, without the list of minimum benefits you could get “cheaper” plans — but that means higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. Meanwhile, what the Senate bill really focuses on is cutting Medicaid. (But wasn’t the problem the exchanges not Medicaid? Shhh!) Again the plan needs reforms but simply lopping off the amount the federal government pays isn’t reform; it’s cost shifting to states that will either have to shift money from other programs (e.g., education) or curtail benefits to their neediest people. No wonder governors are among the loudest critics. We’d favor some reforms that liberals might not like (e.g., work or school requirements for able-bodied adults without children) and would be willing to encourage experimentation (e.g., pay for private insurance premiums for Medicaid recipients instead of subsidizing fee for service medicine). But it’s not intellectually honest to say massive cuts are themselves reforms. (In the end, such reforms might save money, but the purpose is getting people into the work world and shifting to managed care). So what do we have here? Coverage in the exchanges gets worse and Medicaid gets cut back, significantly (which among other things hits anti-opioid abuse programs). But never fear, big tax cuts go to the rich. Huh?!? Yup, taking all that money out of support for the exchanges and for Medicaid allows Republicans to undo the taxes on the wealthy among us. We would have more respect for Republicans who said “We don’t want the feds to make insurance more accessible for middle- and working-class people because tax cuts for wealthy folks are more important to us.” But of course they don’t have the nerve to say that. The shell game isn’t fooling that many Americans. The Kaiser Family Foundation’s June poll finds that the GOP replacement plan now gets a thumbs down from 55 percent of Americans. It’s President Trump’s base that has figured out the Republican scheme is rotten. The poll finds that “support for the replacement plan has decreased among Republicans (from 67 percent in May to 56 percent currently) and among supporters of President Trump (from 69 percent to 55 percent).” Perhaps they are learning what is in the bill, and learning what’s not to like. Meanwhile, Obamacare is viewed positively by a majority of Americans, the first time that has happened since 2010. What voters really like is Medicaid, which happens to be what the Senate is hitting the hardest: • The majority of the public – regardless of partisanship – hold favorable views of Medicaid, the government health insurance and long-term care program for low-income adults and children. Three-fourths (74 percent) of the public say they have a favorable view of the program, including four in ten (37 percent) who have a “very favorable” view. In addition, six in ten say the program is working well for most low-income people nationally (61 percent) and seven in ten say the program is working well for most low-income people in their state (67 percent). • When asked about proposed changes to the Medicaid program, a majority of the public support allowing states to impose work requirements on non-disabled adults (70 percent) or drug testing as a condition of enrollment (64 percent). However, fewer support changes that would cut funding or alter the funding structure. For example, about one-third support reducing funding for Medicaid expansion or limiting how much money each state gets from the federal government each year. The Affordable Care Act is much more popular (51 percent) than the GOP alternative (38 percent). Voters also don’t like dumping the minimum essential benefits: The poll finds support for the status quo with two-thirds of the public saying they want the federal government to continue to require health insurance companies to cover a certain set of benefits while about three in ten (31 percent) say states should be able to decide whether insurers can sell plans that cover fewer benefits than currently required. There are party differences with a large majority of Democrats supporting the status quo (81 percent) compared to fewer, but still a majority, of independents (65 percent) and Republicans (52 percent). This, by the way, is a back door way of getting out of coverage for expensive procedures for those with preexisting conditions. That’s because insurers can “offer skinny plans with less coverage that falls far short of the needs of those with serious health conditions.” As a result, “Young and healthy people will opt for those plans, leaving those with pre-existing conditions in their own, much more costly, market. In the end, the effect is the same as if companies could just outright discriminate against those with serious health problems.” I doubt Trump understands what is in the bill (someone should ask him the justification for slashing Medicaid) but senators sure do. They’ve been posting images of themselves studying the bill intently. There will be no excuses. If they support the bill, they’re speeding up the demise of the exchanges, slashing Medicaid and giving back millions to the super-rich. That’s what Senate staff came up with in secret. I’d have kept it secret too.

Put on your x-ray glasses to see right through Trumpcare,
Distinguished pol of the week,"While Republicans on Capitol Hill were trying to defend a bill that simultaneously failed to replace Obamacare and took health care away from millions to pay for tax cuts for the rich, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) was having none of it. “I have deep concerns with details in the U.S. Senate’s plan to fix America’s health care system and the resources needed to help our most vulnerable, including those who are dealing with drug addiction, mental illness and chronic health problems and have nowhere else to turn,” he said in a Twitter message. To the chagrin of Obamacare critics on the right, Kasich has expanded Medicaid in his state, thereby covering approximately 700,000 more people. More than 200,000 more gained coverage through the exchanges. Ohio thereby reduced its non-elderly adult uninsured population from 16 percent to 9 percent. Kasich warned lawmakers, “Sustainable solutions to the many complex problems facing our health care system will never be solved with a one-party approach that’s developed behind closed doors, without public discussion and input.” He then urged senators “to step back and take a good, hard look at this important issue and to reach across the aisle in working toward solutions.” It is not clear what effect, if any, that will have on senators, specifically Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), but Kasich was one of the few Republicans talking about improving coverage and looking out for the most vulnerable. In March he argued, “Don’t kill Medicaid expansion. And you’ve got to fix the exchange, but you have to have an ability to subsidize people at lower income levels.” He continued, “Here’s what we’re talking about. If you’re drug addicted, if you’re mentally ill, you have to consistently see the doctor. From what I see in this House bill, the resources are not there.” That would be even more true of the Senate bill which over time makes deeper cuts to Medicaid. In the past he’s ridiculed the GOP approach on Capitol Hill. “And we’re going to fix Obamacare by repealing some of the tax increases on some of the richest people in the country and then have less resources to help people with mental illness and drug addiction? It’s foolhardy. It’s nonsense. I don’t buy it.” Well, at least one Republican has figured this out. Kasich is not a defender of Obamacare or the status quo. He forthrightly describes the problems with exchanges, many of which have one or no insurers. But he’s not in this to extract money from the system for tax cuts for the rich. He is a lonely figure right now in the GOP, the rare individual looking to reform and improve the system without hurting the most vulnerable. He deserves credit for that. For all that, we can say, well done, Governor Kasich.

How the Senate bill could send the health insurance market into a death spiral,"Senate Republican leaders unveiled their health-care bill Thursday morning, after weeks of crafting it behind closed doors. The bill keeps some popular parts of the Affordable Care Act, such as the provision preventing insurance companies from charging people more or denying them coverage based on preexisting conditions, and eliminates some unpopular parts, such as the individual mandate that requires people to buy insurance or pay a penalty. [What the Senate bill changes about Obamacare] But those two provisions, taken together, are likely to send the individual marketplace into a “death spiral,” ending with only the sickest people insured, sky-high premiums and insurers exiting the individual market, according to experts across the political spectrum. The bill has a $112 billion market stabilization fund to prevent this, but experts doubt it, or a similar measure in the House bill, would be enough. Here’s how a death spiral would happen. People shopping for insurance in the individual market all sit on a spectrum from healthy to sick.  Because of the preexisting condition protections put in place by the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies must offer all these people insurance at the same price. The individual mandate encourages healthy people to buy insurance, decreasing the average health-care costs of all the insured people — and therefore, their premiums. (Note that in these animations, the number of people and the number of dollar signs are illustrative. They don’t indicate the actual proportion of people in the marketplace or the premiums they’re paying.)   But the Senate bill disrupts this. It keeps the protections for those with preexisting conditions but gets rid of any incentive for healthy people to buy insurance. If they get sick down the road, they could just start buying insurance then. When they leave the marketplace and only sicker people remain, the average health care costs for insured people would increase, causing premiums to increase.  And this is where the so-called “death spiral” starts. Now that premiums are higher, it doesn’t make sense for the barely sick people to remain in the market, so they leave. Again, this makes costs for insured people rise, so premiums rise.  Then the same thing happens to the moderately sick people.  Until finally, only the sickest people remain in the market.  And somewhere along the way, offering individual insurance plans at all becomes a losing game for insurance companies, and they start to leave the marketplace. If this series of events occurs, the individual marketplace will end up less stable and robust than it was even before the ACA. Then insurance companies could charge sick people more than healthy people, so healthy people’s premiums would stay low and they wouldn’t have the same incentive to leave the marketplace. Republicans control the Senate, but to pass the bill, they'll need almost all of their members to support it, and that's proving challenging. Five GOP senators have already announced their opposition to the bill as written"
Dean Heller of Nevada becomes fifth GOP senator to come out against health-care bill,"Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) said Friday that he cannot support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s health-care bill without changes to it, becoming the fifth GOP senator to take that position since the bill was released on Thursday. Heller, who is up for reelection in 2018, has expressed concerns about the way the measure addresses the future of Medicaid. The proposal would impose long-term federal spending cuts on the program. “I cannot support a piece of legislation that takes away insurance from tens of millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Nevadans,” Heller said in a news conference held in his home state. Nevada, like most states, expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Heller’s comments came the day after four conservative senators issued a joint statement saying they cannot support the bill unless it is changed. Three of them said they worried it does not go far enough in repealing the ACA, known as Obamacare. A fourth said he worried the process was rushed. [Health 202: McConnell will be a legislative wizard if health care passes] Those senators are Ted Cruz of Texas; Ron Johnson of Wisconsin; Rand Paul of Kentucky; and Mike Lee of Utah. McConnell (R-Ky.) cannot pass the bill if he loses more than two Republican votes. The GOP holds a 52-48 advantage over Democrats in the Senate, with Vice President Pence standing ready to break ties in the GOP’s favor.

Will Capito stand up for voters Trumpcare would hurt?,"If you want to find quintessential President Trump voters, you would do well to look to West Virginia, where his promised restoration of the coal industry epitomized his nationalistic and populist appeal to white working-class voters. What would happen under the Senate’s health-care bill? Sen. Shelley Moore Capito will be looking at a variety of factors. As a poor state, West Virginia, has benefited greatly from Obamacare: Between 2013 and 2014, the number of uninsured individuals in West Virginia fell by 38.8 percent. Meanwhile, as one of the states that expanded Medicaid, West Virginia saw annual enrollment in the program rise by 34.3 percent. In addition, about 31,000 individuals purchased insurance on the state’s new health insurance exchange. Between 2013 and 2014, the number of people without health insurance nationwide declined by 18.8 percent. The law’s effects on premium rates have been less clear. For instance, a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers found an increase of over 5 percent for premiums in the individual market between 2014 and 2015, while a study by the Commonwealth Fund found no change. West Virginia has also suffered tremendously from the opioid abuse epidemic. The Post reported in March: Deaths in West Virginia have overwhelmed a state program providing burial assistance for needy families for at least the fifth year in a row, causing the program to be nearly out of money four months before the end of the fiscal year, according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR). Funeral directors in West Virginia say the state’s drug overdose epidemic, the worst in the nation, is partly to blame. West Virginia’s indigent burial program, which budgets about $2 million a year for funeral financial assistance, had already been under pressure from the aging of the baby-boom generation. The program offers an average of $1,250 to help cover funeral expenses for families who can’t otherwise afford them. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of people are getting treated for opioid abuse through Medicaid. (“1.29 million people are receiving treatment for substance use disorders or mental illnesses thanks to the Medicaid expansion, according to research conducted by Harvard Medical School Health Economics professor Richard Frank and New York University dean Sherry Glied. About 220,000 of those people are receiving treatment for opioid abuse,” Business Insider reports.) Curtail Medicaid and a state like West Virginia won’t be able to treat as many people as well as it does now — and that’s not even preventing the graveyards from filling up. Because West Virginia benefited so greatly from the Affordable Care Act, losing some of those gains (e.g., Medicaid access) would come at an extreme cost. (One study found that “states that achieved double-digit reductions in their uninsured rate for working-age adults between 2013 to 2015—Arkansas, California, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and West Virginia—all had expanded Medicaid as soon as federal resources became available in 2014.”) Capito put out a statement vowing to examine the bill closely “using several factors to evaluate whether it provides access to affordable health care for West Virginians, including those on the Medicaid expansion and those struggling with drug addiction.” We think on the merits she will have a hard time disputing the conclusion that it will hit her state — hard.

"For this GOP senator, rejecting the health-care bill should be a no-brainer","Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) occupies a unique position. He is the most vulnerable Republican senator on the ballot in 2018 in a state that, as a result of the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion, made 204,000 people (a 90 percent increase) “newly eligible for coverage, most of them childless adults who are working but whose employers do not offer health insurance coverage.” This is the working poor, in other words. Nevada’s Republican governor has been among the most vocal GOP opponents of House Republicans’ American Health Care Act, for obvious reasons. His state will face horrid human and political consequences if either the House bill or the Senate bill, which cuts Medicaid more than the House bill over the long term, becomes law: [Brian] Sandoval is one of five Republican governors — in states that have expanded Medicaid — pushing to keep Medicaid expansion intact or replace it with something very similar. He sent a letter to House Republicans on January 5, noting that more than 400,000 Nevada residents have gained coverage as a result of the ACA, in large part because of Medicaid expansion. … Nevada’s current total Medicaid spending is about $6.4 billion, but the state only pays $1.1 billion of that; the rest is picked up by the federal government (for the population that was already eligible for Medicaid pre-ACA, the state pays a higher percentage of the cost than they do for the newly eligible population; for people who are newly eligible for Medicaid under the ACA, the federal government paid 100 percent of the cost through 2016, and is now paying 95 percent of the cost). If Medicaid expansion is repealed and replaced with something that cuts federal funding below what the state currently receives, there are concerns that people could lose coverage or benefits could be cut. House Republicans’ proposal to transition Medicaid to block grants or per-capita allotments would almost certainly result in reduced federal funding. Nevada voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and chose a Democrat to replace retiring Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). It’s a race that would be an uphill fight even without the health-care vote. If Heller does go along with the bill, his Democratic opponent will have a field day using the popular GOP governor’s words against Heller. One reason for Clinton’s victory was the successful mobilization of the culinary workers union. And that’s another problem for Heller. The Senate bill “erases a raft of tax increases that have helped offset the cost of Obamacare, but not the ‘Cadillac Tax’ that Heller and the powerful Culinary Union have vocally opposed.” The Nevada Independent explains: “That measure, which imposes a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans, would instead be delayed until 2026 under the Senate bill. Heller introduced legislation earlier this year to repeal the Cadillac Tax, which is currently scheduled to kick in in 2020. He said 1.3 million Nevadans would feel the pinch if it takes effect.” With the Cadillac Tax in the bill, a Heller vote in favor of the bill would put him crosswise with his constituents once again — and his own rhetoric. Republicans’ desired intent to shift wealth from poorer to richer Americans also poses a serious problem for Heller. The Medicaid cuts and the reductions in the subsidies for the exchanges are bad enough, but when coupled with jumbo tax cuts for the rich, the bill would exacerbate Nevada’s growing income inequality problem. Last September, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, “Nevada is one of just eight states that saw a slight increase in income inequality from 2014 to 2015, according to new census data that raise questions about the evenness of the state’s economic recovery.” The numbers may explain why Democrats have been winning statewide races in the state. It is true that “all groups in Nevada earned more in 2015 than they did in 2014. But the increases were higher at the top, with the top 20 percent of households seeing a 7.7 percent increase in average earnings, from $161,083 to $173,448, while the bottom 20 percent saw a hike of 2 percent, bringing their average annual earnings from $12,513 to $12,783.” Try to explain to Nevada constituents why a mammoth tax cut for the rich is a good idea. Heller will be under pressure to get in line with party leadership and the White House. However, there is no member with a bigger need to claim to one of the two “no tickets,” the number of votes Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can lose and still win passage of the bill. Heller had better put in his dibs early before others announce they can never vote for a bill this bad.

The Health 202: McConnell will be a legislative wizard if health care passes,"THE PROGNOSIS Senate Republicans have finally revealed their plan to revamp the Affordable Care Act. Now, they're just trying to pass it. There will be lots of twists and turns along the path to an anticipated vote next week -- and it's by no means assured the GOP will get there. Capitol Hill was awash yesterday with reaction to the health-care bill released by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), which would retain some key components of the ACA while still erasing its taxes and Medicaid expansion. The bill isn't dead on arrival -- no GOP senators have permanently closed the door on voting for it -- as long as some concessions are made. But if McConnell succeeds in uniting his deeply skeptical conference around the measure, he could legitimately be labeled a legislative wizard. McConnell can afford to lose just two Republican senators in his 52-vote caucus because the GOP bill has to meet a threshold of a 50-vote simple majority given the fact it is being subjected to arcane budget rules (and that would leave Vice President Pence to cast a tie-breaking vote for approval). It is a very tall order. By The Post's whip count, a dozen Senate Republicans have indicated they oppose or have concerns about McConnell's discussion draft."" Moderates were circumspect on Thursday"
How cartoonists are needling the Senate health-care bill,"IS THE Senate health-care bill about to flatline? Several Republican senators have said they won’t support the new approach to an Obamacare surrogate. Governors from both major parties wrote in The Washington Post: “All Americans will come out on the losing end if we simply replace one divisive plan with another.” And even President Trump privately called the House version of repeal-and-replace “mean.” Meanwhile, The Post’s editorial board urged: “Instead of forcing this choice between Americans’ physical health and the nation’s fiscal health, senators should end this repeal-and-replace disaster now.” As we go through the legislative looking-glass on this issue, weighing the prescriptive elixirs before us, some of America’s cartoonists have their own approach. They render Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as a tortoise touting a medical shell game and offer their own two-word directive as treatment: “Mock turtle.” Here’s how some of the nation’s visual commentators are needling the GOP Senate bill: ADAM ZYGLIS (Buffalo News): CLAY BENNETT (Chattanooga Times Free Press): STEVE SACK (Minneapolis Star Tribune): R.J. MATSON (CQ Roll Call): NATE BEELER (Columbus Dispatch): TOM TOLES (The Washington Post): Read more: Greg Sargent: Here comes the Senate GOP’s health bill. It’s a cruel and cynical shell game. Jennifer Rubin: Is there anybody actually in favor of the Senate health-care bill? The Post’s View: Republicans’ health-care hypocrisy is on full display John Kasich and John Hickenlooper: Another one-party health-care plan will be doomed to failure  "
Morning Bits,"Just another con. “More than 600 employees at a Carrier plant in Indianapolis are bracing for layoffs beginning next month, despite being told by President Trump that nearly all the jobs at the plant had been saved. The deal, announced with great fanfare before Trump took office, was billed not only as a heroic move to keep jobs from going to Mexico but also as a seismic shift in the economic development landscape.” Trump’s bluff on the tapes backfires. “Trump showed the whole world that when he sweats, he panics. That’s a lesson that will be remembered by the planet’s bad actors for however long this president holds office.” Trump’s promise of better coverage for average people was smoke and mirrors. “Senate Republican leaders released a health overhaul Thursday that would undo large parts of the Affordable Care Act, including its expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled and a requirement that most Americans pay a penalty if they don’t have insurance. . . . [T]his legislation would tighten the income eligibility for the assistance, meaning fewer people would be able to get the subsidies. The credits would also be less robust than under the ACA.” Trump managed to swindle his voters with populist hooey. “The bill would strike Affordable Care Act taxes on high earners, particularly a levy on investment income that fell on married couples with more than $250,000 of adjusted gross income and single filers with more than $200,000 of adjusted gross income. It also nixes a Medicare Hospital Insurance tax on incomes above $250,000.” Her rivals won’t trick Senate Minority leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) into giving up her office. “We are paving a way for a new generation of leadership. Again, I respect any opinion that my members have, but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.” Bam! The Senate health-care bill is a cruel scam. “Many people addicted to prescription painkillers and heroin — some 2.6 million nationwide — will face tougher odds of recovery under a draft Senate health care bill released on Thursday, according to addiction experts.” If true, imagine the senators who fall for the flimflam and support the bill! “When it comes to managing Republicans’ best interests, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, rarely loses. So it is possible that Mr. McConnell views the potential failure of a hastily written health care bill as an eventual boon. . . .  Mr. McConnell and many of his aides are also eager to get to the business of changing the tax code, which they view as less difficult than health care, and have been working with the White House behind the scenes to get that effort started. For Mr. McConnell, cutting taxes is a much higher priority than health care, which time and President Trump have turned into quicksand for him and his fellow Republicans.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

Which GOP senators will walk the plank for a rotten health-care bill?,"GOP Senate leaders are presenting to their members for the first time today a concrete health-care plan. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has done what Republicans (falsely) accused Democrats of doing during the Affordable Care Act — drafted a bill in secret, rushed it through and ignored concerns of stakeholders, including governors. The process is so reckless that you do wonder whether this is all for show. “According to two Republicans in close contact with Senate GOP leadership granted anonymity to describe private conversations, McConnell is threatening to bring the bill to a vote next week even if he doesn’t have the votes to pass it,” The Post reports. “But some believe that message is aimed at trying to pressure Republicans to support the bill, rather than an absolute commitment. A McConnell spokeswoman declined to comment.” Senators should be smarter than to be bulldozed or bluffed into voting for something that does not meet the president’s or their own goals and which they will barely have time to consider before a vote. Senators should keep in mind the following: 1.  The bill must be measured against the Affordable Care Act, not the House’s American Health Care Act bill. It’s the ACA their constituents will lose and which will be used to assess whether Trumpcare is more or less generous. 2. Thirty-one states expanded Medicaid under the ACA. That works out to 20 GOP senators. They will be asked to vote for a rollback in coverage and thereafter a reduced level of support for beneficiaries, ending Medicaid’s status as an entitlement. If their state must reduce benefits or narrow coverage even further, senators voting for the bill will be held responsible. That includes senators in states Hillary Clinton carried in 2016 — Sens. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) (the most vulnerable incumbent) and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Both their governors have inveighed against the Senate and House approach and pleaded with lawmakers to work with governors. 3. There are plenty of states in which the ACA substantially lowered the number of uninsured.  The nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund found: [Nine] states experienced 10 to 13 percentage-point reductions in their adult uninsured rate from 2013 to 2015. Six of these states—California, Kentucky, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and West Virginia—sliced their uninsured rates by at least half over the two years. Some states that did not expand Medicaid as of the beginning of 2015 had declines of as much as 7 to 9 percentage points, including Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Montana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas. The ACA’s premium subsidies and insurance marketplaces were available in every state, leading to the decline in uninsured rates in states without the Medicaid expansion. By the end of 2015, more than a third of states (17 states and D.C.) had adult uninsured rates below 10 percent, compared to six states and D.C. in 2014 and only Massachusetts and D.C. in 2013. Despite these gains, uninsured rates remained high in some states, including Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas, where at least one of five adults was uninsured. Still, this marks an improvement over 2014, when 10 states had an adult uninsured rate of 20 percent or more, and 2013, when 22 states did. No matter how strenuously Republicans claim the number of covered adults doesn’t matter for the vast majority of Americans, coverage means access to health care, especially routine preventative care. 4. While the Senate bill purportedly includes a restriction on Planned Parenthood funding, that likely will fall by the wayside in the reconciliation process. That means Republican senators who vowed to vote for a bill that ended Planned Parenthood funding will be breaking their promise if they support the bill. 5. A vote to deprive Americans of health care or limit it may make competitive seats into real pickup chances for Democrats in 2018. These include Heller in Nevada and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). It may also move safe seats into less-safe seats or seats that invite credible primary challengers. That group would include Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) 6. The bill is a huge wealth transfer from poor to rich. Cuts in benefits to low- and middle-income Americans will fund huge tax cuts for the very richest Americans. This will be fodder for opponents to claim that Republicans are phony populists, just another generation of right-wingers who favor the wealthiest among us.

The Health 202: Here's what's in the Senate health-care bill,"THE PROGNOSIS Senate GOP leaders are poised to release an Obamacare overhaul that clearly tries to woo the moderate members of their party while also keeping spending in check and giving conservatives a few goodies, too. Yesterday afternoon, The Health 202 scooped the major details of the draft health-care legislation that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wants to bring up for a vote next week. Like the House bill passed in May, the Senate version would put big dents in the Affordable Care Act, repealing just about all of its taxes, pulling back on Medicaid expansion and ditching the individual mandate to buy coverage and the employer mandate to offer it. But the Senate bill contains three elements McConnell is betting will win over a half dozen or so moderates who remain skeptical but whose votes are crucial to overall passage (remember: the majority leader needs only 50 votes since arcane budget rules are being applied to the measure, meaning he can lose just two Republicans). McConnell's draft, hashed out behind closed doors, basically retains Obamacare's insurance subsidy structure -- with just a few tweaks -- takes a gentler approach than the House bill in the short-term to Medicaid expansion, and wouldn't allow states to opt out of key protections for patients with preexisting conditions. The idea, aides and lobbyists say, is to provide a softer landing for people at lower ends of the income spectrum than under the House bill. That measure based the subsidies only on age and didn't peg them to actual premiums, resulting in estimates of dramatic cost spikes for some Americans and prompting a heavy onslaught of public criticism that spooked many House moderates. The Senate bill tries to fix that problem -- sort of. Its subsidies closely mirror Obamacare subsidies, which are currently available to Americans earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Starting in 2020, under the Senate bill, this assistance would be capped for those earning up to 350 percent — but anyone below that line could get the subsidies if they’re not eligible for Medicaid. As under the ACA, the subsidies would be pegged to a benchmark insurance plan each year, ensuring that the assistance grows enough over time to keep coverage affordable for customers. McConnell is also offering moderates an approach to Medicaid he hopes will be more politically palatable to them. It's true the draft proposes even deeper cuts to Medicaid than the House version by tying federal spending to a slower growth index. But that wouldn't kick in for another seven years, well past moderate senators' next reelection battles. And it doesn't fully end the ACA's Medicaid expansion until five years from now, gradually easing down the extra federal payments over three years starting in 2021. The Senate bill also retains the ACA's protections for patients with preexisting conditions. It eliminates the House bill's pathway for states to lift a ban on insurers from charging people with serious medical conditions higher premiums, which would have been another political hotbed for moderates. It does expand the use of certain 1332 waivers"" to give states more flexibility -- a provision that conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) wanted -- but those waivers don't open the door to ducking the preexisting protections. The Senate bill would also provide funding in 2018 and 2019 for extra Obamacare subsidies to insurers to cover the cost-sharing discounts they’re required to give the lowest-income patients. Insurers have been deeply concerned over whether the subsidies will continue"
Will overconfidence prompt the GOP to blunder on health care?,"The downside for Republicans in an over-hyped win in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District race? Arrogance and over-confidence, a deadly combination, that can prompt politicians to disregard voters and common sense. We will see if that condition afflicts Republicans if they attempt to ram home a health-care bill that remains known only to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his staff. (Even Republicans on the super-secret committee do not yet know exactly what it looks like.) We start with the voters, who consistently have told pollsters they really do not like American Health Care Act (AHCA) the House passed. The latest Reuters poll tells a familiar picture: “The June 9-13 poll shows that a majority of the country thinks the American Health Care Act would be harmful for low-income Americans, people with pre-existing health conditions and Medicaid recipients. Overall, 41 percent of American adults oppose the House plan, while 30 percent support it. Another 29 percent said they ‘don’t know,’ according to the poll.” Some polls show support for the plan at less than 20 percent. Just how unpopular is the GOP health-care plan? “Based on an aggregate of polling from the Roper Center public opinion data, [Chris] Warsaw said the AHCA is less popular than Obamacare, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (the bank bailout), the Dodd-Frank regulations, President George W. Bush’s tax cuts, and even the failed healthcare plan from President Bill Clinton.” Oh. Well, the Senate bill will be different, GOP leaders might tell their troops. How different? And will it be even less popular? As details leak out it seems that the overarching structure of the bill mirrors the House approach: Substantial cuts in Medicaid, big tax cuts for the rich and roll-back of the guarantee on minimum benefits and/or protection against preexisting conditions. Ultimately, it may wind up looking a whole lot more like the House bill than one would have guessed listening to GOP senators’ critiques of the AHCA. Republicans will have no way of knowing, absent some hearings and an extended period of debate, whether this will be better received by the public and other stakeholders (e.g., hospitals, doctors). Republicans seem to operate in some smug political bubble in which they imagine whatever they pass will be popular, at least with their base. The House experience should have disabused them of the notion they can sell a dog’s breakfast to the American people. When it comes to health care, the details matter a whole lot. Perhaps Republicans, flush with confidence after a four-point victory in a Republican 9.5+ district, believe the president can sell the American people on anything. After all, he sold the country on him. Well, President Trump hasn’t made the AHCA popular. To the contrary, his own popularity, perhaps as a result of the ACHA, has fallen precipitously from an already low mark. (Pollster.com’s average has his disapproval at approximately 55 percent, his approval at 40 percent.) Republicans seem to have forgotten all the lessons of the Affordable Care Act, the very lessons they rode to majority control of both houses: And all of those issues arose with regard to a plan that was giving people coverage — not taking it away or making it more costly. Rather than jump off the cliff with no net, Republicans might consider consulting with their own states’ governors. The National Governors Association released a document on Tuesday authored by six Republicans and seven Democrats. In it they set out a list of priorities including engagement with the states on Medicaid changes; “Advanceable and refundable premium tax credits [that] reflect income, age and regional variation in costs”; support for behavior health and information technology efforts; and maintaining funding for “public health and maternal and child health programs such as the Prevention and Public Health Fund, Children’s Health Insurance Program and the Title V Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant” and opioid abuse prevention and treatment. You see, if Congress had hearings, lawmakers could actually hear from governors and include popular programs with a track record of success. Nah, they’d rather vote blind for something the public will hate as much or more than the House version.

"The Daily 202: ‘Russia has been a distraction’ from health care, some Democrats fear","THE BIG IDEA: One main takeaway for Democrats from their loss in Georgia’s special election is that the party has not focused enough on issues that directly impact people’s lives. Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, told his colleagues during a private meeting yesterday that voters in the 2018 midterm elections will almost certainly be more motivated by an issue like health care than the escalating Russia investigation, and he urged lawmakers to keep their eye on the ball. “The shiny object which is Russia and the Trump administration is in many ways a smokescreen for Mitch McConnell and the Senate to do things they probably wouldn’t be able to get away with if the public and media were paying more attention,” Crowley explained in an interview last night. “We’re all guilty of that to some degree.” The congressman added that Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and Donald Trump firing James Comey as FBI director remain important. “But we need to walk and chew gum at the same time and recognize that the issues that really matter to people are the ones that affect their everyday lives,” he said. While Republican candidate Karen Handel supported the House health-care bill in Georgia’s Sixth District, and Democrat Jon Ossoff opposed it, the issue was not front and center in the race “The fact that we have spent so much time talking about Russia has been a distraction from what should be the clear contrast between Democrats and the Trump agenda, which is on economics,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). Asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” whether Ossoff’s defeat means the party should become more progressive, the senator responded that it’s more an issue of what they’re talking about. “When I'm back in Connecticut, I often get on a commuter bus and ride it for just an hour to talk to folks that don't normally call my office or write my office,” Murphy explained. “They are never talking about issues like Russia. They are not talking, frankly, about what's on cable news at night.” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who as a member of the Intelligence Committee is constantly asked about the Russia investigation, worries that the health debate is not breaking through because Democrats aren’t talking about it enough. “When reporters ask me a question about Russia, I now say, ‘I’m happy to talk about it, but you’re going to have to listen to me talk about the health care challenge ahead first,’” he said during a press conference to talk about the opioid epidemic. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) lamented this dynamic when Attorney General Jeff Sessions testified before the Intelligence Committee last week: While people watched the Sessions hearing, Senate Republicans worked behind closed doors to pass a disastrous secret health care bill. The Democratic polling firms Garin-Hart-Yang and Global Strategy Group conducted a national survey for Priorities USA, the Democratic super PAC, last month that found the Comey news and concerns related to Russia are major liabilities for Republicans. But the pollsters found that the health-care issue is a significantly bigger driver of voter behavior. “A key imperative for Democrats and progressive organizations is to bring even greater attention to the health care issue in the weeks and months to come,” the pollsters said in a memo about their numbers. “Disapproval of the health care proposal transcends partisan lines. Furthermore, health care needs the added reinforcement since it is less dominant in the news compared to Russia, which has been the subject of new revelations for several weeks in a row. As a result, more voters say they’re closely following news about Russia right now than say the same about health care.” Part of the struggle for Democrats is that have been trying for weeks to marshal opposition to a Senate bill that hasn’t been publicly released yet. “They have been forced to fight against a phantom,” Amy Goldstein and Juliet Eilperin explain in today’s paper. “Until (the bill comes out today), Senate Democrats have tried to foment opposition to the impending bill by focusing on different constituencies who they say would be harmed. … Off Capitol Hill, leading groups that share Senate Democrats’ concerns about the GOP’s health-care ideas acknowledge the difficulty of trying to lobby without actual Senate legislation against which to rail. ‘It’s very challenging,’ said Dick Woodruff, the American Cancer Society’s senior vice president of federal advocacy. Without a Senate bill, members of his group continue to express concern about key elements of the House’s American Health Care Act.” That dynamic won’t last, Democrats are quick to note. The Congressional Budget Office will score the Senate plan, and the numbers may be slightly better than the House version (or not) – but the toplines about how many fewer people will have coverage a decade from now will still look bad for the GOP. Insurance companies, meanwhile, continue to pull out of exchanges for the coming year. Anthem yesterday announced that it will not participate in Wisconsin and Indiana’s Obamacare markets for 2018. The insurer pulled out of the federal exchange in Ohio earlier this month (a dynamic I wrote about from Columbus). Just as in Ohio, Anthem cited a “volatile” market and “uncertainty” about the future of the law emanating from Washington. “We can debate over how many years Medicaid expansion is phased out, but people’s rates are going to go up in 2018,” said Lauren Passalacqua, the communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “Insurance companies are raising rates and blaming Washington, which is controlled by a Republican President and Congress. … Your health care is always top of mind. Voters may not remember that the process was done in secret or how the House and Senate versions of the bill differed, but they’re definitely not going to forget that their coverage became more expensive and harder to get.” Tamara Draut, vice president of policy and research for Demos, a liberal advocacy organization, said that focusing on pocketbook issues is the only way Democrats will win back working-class voters who defected from the party last year. She recently conducted focus groups with white working class voters in Columbus, Ohio, who voted for Barack Obama but switched to Trump. “People are desperate for some action to give them some real economic relief,” she said. “The kitchen table concerns are what keep them up at night and give them ulcers. Health care is clearly one of those.” Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, who has focused for the past few months on mobilizing opposition to repealing Obamacare, sees the Russia-related investigations as complementary to his cause. “There are few issues, if any, that will impact people as much as repealing health care. But I think it’s a bit of a false choice as to whether to focus on that more than Russia,” he said. “Because in the end, the scandal around Russia has raised so many doubts about the president’s ability to be honest. And that underlying damage to his credibility and character traits makes it even harder for him to sell people on his health plan. He can say he’ll reduce costs and improve care, but after the Russia scandal people don’t believe him. We will win or lose the midterms based on the bread-and-butter kitchen table issues. We may win the argument about those issues because the president has lost standing with the American people over the Russia scandal.” Ferguson, a cancer survivor, directed the independent expenditure arm of the DCCC in 2014 and worked for Hillary Clinton last year. So he understands how stories can play out in unexpected ways. “The contours of the Russia debate could change dramatically before we get to the midterms,” he said. “If Bob Mueller has cleared (Trump), it’s probably not as much of an issue. If conversely there are pending indictments, then it’s a totally different ball of wax. We just don’t know.” On the other hand, he noted, most House Republicans are already on the record voting for a politically-toxic bill, whether it becomes law or not. -- Frustrations have been bubbling up for months among some liberal commentators that party leaders are spending too much time chasing the Russia story at the expense of protecting Obamacare. “The Russia Scandal Is Distracting Democrats From Trumpcare,” New Republic senior editor Jeet Heer complained in a widely shared piece last week. “For all the attention the scandal deserves, it is also, from the point of view of resisting the Trump agenda, counterproductive and politically demobilizing. The Russia story is high political theater (but) there’s very little room in this drama for activists. At best, if the Senate or some other branch of the government is seen as failing to do its duties, protestors might play a role in raising a stink. But on the whole, the Russia investigation is one where the system proceeds according to its own rules, while the public looks on. The battle over health care, by contrast, requires enflaming mass passions.” “Democrats Should Focus More on Jobs, Less on Russia,” progressive writer Robert Borosage urged his compatriots in a column for The Nation back in March. “Democrats are railing about the Russians and the last election, while Trump is talking jobs, law and order, protecting our borders, and health care. We know which of these speak to the challenges Americans face. Worse, the Democratic attack targets Trump individually, removing the right-wing Republican Congress from the picture. This simply distracts from the real deal.” DRIVING THE DAY—WHAT THE NEW SENATE BILL DOES: -- Paige Winfield Cunningham, author of our Health 202, obtained a copy of the “discussion draft” that McConnell is going to unveil today: “The Senate GOP leadership plan would roll back the ACA’s taxes, phase down its Medicaid expansion, rejigger its subsidies, give states wider latitude in opting out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year… “The bill largely mirrors the House measure that narrowly passed last month but with some significant changes: While the House legislation pegged federal insurance subsidies to age, the Senate bill would link them to income as the ACA does. The Senate proposal cuts off Medicaid expansion more gradually than the House bill, but would enact deeper long-term cuts to the health-care program for low-income Americans. It also removes language restricting federally-subsidized health plans from covering abortions, which may have run afoul of complex budget rules.” The bill’s contents are far from final: “Aides stress that the plan is likely to undergo more changes … to pass … Even if the Senate measure does pass the upper chamber, it will still have to pass muster with the more conservative House before any legislation could be enacted.” FOUR FLASHPOINTS: -- The Senate Majority Leader, who can only afford two defections among his 52 members, has struggled to placate the opposite ideological ends of his caucus. Just because a draft is finally emerging does not mean those disagreements have been resolved. Paige Winfield Cunningham, Juliet Eilperin and Sean Sullivan report: “On the eve of the bill’s release, [McConnell still] faced the prospect of an open revolt from key conservative and moderate GOP senators ... Republicans familiar with the effort said Senate leaders have more work to do to secure the 50 votes needed … with Vice President Pence set to cast the tiebreaking vote.” -- Any way you cut it, insurance companies are winners in this proposal. Republican leaders briefed insurers yesterday afternoon before they briefed their own membership (at 9:30 a.m. today). The bill text will post for the public to read around 11 a.m. A Politico reporter spotted a top health insurance lobbyist in McConnell’s office last night. From a Vox health reporter: Rollback of insurance regulations, stabilization fund for insurers, guaranteed funding for insurer subsidies... The health insurance industry made a tactical choice to engage Republicans, not fight them.Looks like it’s paying off. From a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation: Reports of the Senate health bill look like Obamacare-lite for private insurance. The Medicaid changes are a horse of a different color. THE SECRECY NARRATIVE CEMENTS: -- More rank-and-file Republican senators, concerned about political blowback back home, are complaining about the lack of transparency and the rushed timeline. The Wall Street Journal’s Stephanie Armour, Kristina Peterson and Louise Radnofsky report: “Some Republicans, including Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), are calling the timetable too rushed to ensure their support. ‘I would find it hard to believe I will have enough time,’ Mr. Johnson said. ‘I’ve made leadership well aware of the fact that I need information to make a final decision, and if I don’t have the information to justify a yes vote, I won’t be voting yes.’ … Several senators said they were frustrated because they would apparently have a week to review the bill before leadership asks for a vote, raising the possibility that the vote could be pushed into July. ‘The whole process is not satisfactory,’ Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) said. ‘I feel terrible about it.’” -- Rand Paul, McConnell’s fellow Kentuckian, just reintroduced a resolution that would require one day to pass for every 20 pages in a bill or amendment before it could be brought up for consideration on the floor. “Legislation is too often shoved through Congress without proper hearings, amendments, or debate, as the secrecy surrounding the Senate’s health care bill and the pressure to vote for it with little time to fully evaluate the proposal once again remind us,” the Republican said in a statement. -- The covert nature of the negotiations is particularly ironic given Senate Republican attacks on the ACA seven years ago. Karen Tumulty, who covered that fight closely, explains: “Hypocrisy has always been a vital lubricant to making the gears turn in Washington. … Rarely, however, has the double standard been so flagrant as now, when Republicans are scrambling to keep their promise to ‘repeal and replace Obamacare.’ Exhibit A: Mitch McConnell, who is set to produce a draft of a bill to be voted on next week. Back when the Affordable Care Act passed on a party-line vote in 2010, the then-minority leader was full-throated in his denunciation of ‘the partisan route’ that majority Democrats had taken and of the ‘closed-door sweetheart deals that were made to gain the slimmest margin for passage of a bill that’s about their health care.’” WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- The president traveled to Iowa for a rally last night and reentered campaign mode, promising to crack down on illegal immigration and use solar panels to pay for a border wall. John Wagner and Jenna Johnson report: “During a meandering speech, the president, saddled in Washington with sagging job approval numbers, seemed to draw on the energy of his supporters as he made the case that his administration has made ‘amazing progress’ in its first five months. Despite early setbacks, Trump pledged that he would make good on marquee campaign promises to revamp the Affordable Care Act, cut taxes and spur $1 trillion in new spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure … Trump also told the crowd that he is contemplating putting solar panels on the wall that he has pledged to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. ‘The higher it goes, the more valuable it is,’ Trump said. ‘Pretty good imagination, right?’” -- A car bomb exploded in Afghanistan outside a bank where people waited to collect their monthly salaries, killing 29. Sayed Salahuddin reports: “The car detonated in the parking lot of the New Kabul Bank in the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah, where dozens of people, both civilians and security personnel, were waiting to collect their salaries. Governor Hayatullah Hayat said by phone that most of those killed were civilians and at least 60 people were wounded.” GET SMART FAST:​​ As South Korea gears up to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, Seoul’s sports minister is considering a highly controversial proposal: asking North Korea to help host some of the events. The overture comes as part of a broader effort by newly elected President Moon Jae-in to engage with Pyongyang, particularly through sports – but it’s unclear how that will play in the rest of the world.

Trump wrote on Facebook, “Thank you Wyatt and Montana — two young Americans who aren’t afraid to stand up for what they believe in.” (Lindsey Bever) THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Russian government actors tried to hack election-related computer systems in 21 states last year, a top DHS official testified Wednesday, providing further information on the scope of Moscow’s efforts to impede the U.S. electoral system. Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian report: “Samuel Liles, the [DHS’s] acting director of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis Cyber Division, [told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee] that vote-tallying mechanisms were unaffected and that the hackers appeared to be scanning for vulnerabilities — which Liles likened to walking down the street and looking at homes to see who might be inside. But hackers successfully exploited a ‘small number’ of networks, Liles said, likening the act to making it through a home’s front door ... Officials in Arizona and Illinois had previously confirmed that hackers targeted their voter registration system, though news reports suggested the Russian effort was much broader.” Meanwhile, former DHS secretary Jeh Johnson testified in a separate House Intelligence hearing Tuesday that Russia’s meddling was “unprecedented” in both scale and scope. “In retrospect, it would have been easy for me to say I should have brought a sleeping bag and camped out in front of the DNC in the late summer, Johnson testified. He said the severity of the efforts persuaded him to sign an Oct. 7 statement publicly blaming the Kremlin for hacking and engineering the release of emails from the DNC and Clinton’s campaign. “I think the larger issue is it did not get the public attention that it should have"
Will the health-care issue tip 2018 to the Democrats?,"While Republican flacks hype the results of the special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District and Democrats bemoan a loss they likely should have expected, we know that the political landscape will change dramatically between now and 2018. That’s good news for Democrats and reason for Republicans to avoid sitting back to admire their victory in a Republican “9.5-plus” district. As David Wasserman explains: “Last night’s results were far from a disaster for Democrats, and Republicans shouldn’t be tempted to believe their House majority is safe. In fact, their majority is still very much at risk.” For one thing, “unheralded Democratic tax expert Archie Parnell — who ran on a similarly conciliatory, post-partisan message but generated a tiny fraction of the hype [Jon] Ossoff did — shockingly came within three points of Republican Ralph Norman in a district President Trump carried by 18 points last November.” Special elections also tend to be “lagging — rather than leading — indicators,” Wasserman writes. Most important: If Democrats were to outperform their “generic” share by eight points across the board [as they have in special elections] in November 2018, they would pick up 80 seats. Of course, that won’t happen because Republican incumbents will be tougher to dislodge than special election nominees. But these results fit a pattern that should still worry GOP incumbents everywhere, regardless of Trump’s national approval rating and the outcome of the healthcare debate in Congress. Put another way, Democratic candidates in these elections have won an average of 68 percent of the votes Hillary Clinton won in their districts, while Republican candidates have won an average of 54 percent of Trump’s votes. That’s an enthusiasm gap that big enough to gravely imperil the Republican majority next November—even if it didn’t show up in “the special election to end all special elections.” So which significant event(s) might tip the scales even further in Democrats’ direction, and which by contrast would help Republicans hold on? Republicans need to deliver on health care, taxes and jobs while also praying that an economic setback or further foreign conflicts do not unsettle the electorate. If you think they can accomplish all that, then the GOP can rest easy. Of all of those issues, health care — which Republicans used to gain majorities in the House and Senate — may be the most decisive because it is the most personal (and hence most emotional) policy issue. Democrats, by contrast, need evidence that Republicans cannot govern — or do not govern with voters’ interests in mind. A good deal of imagination — if not self-delusion — would be required in order to imagine that the Senate can pass its secret health-care bill and then agree with the House on a bill that can be jammed through via budget reconciliation (which requires a budget). One has to get really creative to see that the result would be a health-care bill that the country likes. With each iteration, the GOP health-care plan has gotten worse marks. To that point, Politico reports: As the GOP-led Senate prepares to take up the measure, only 35 percent of voters surveyed approve of the bill passed by the House last month. Nearly half of voters, 49 percent, disapprove of the bill. The other 16 percent don’t know or don’t have an opinion, the poll shows. POLITICO/Morning Consult polling indicates the bill has become less popular since the House advanced it in early May. Immediately after the bill passed, slightly more voters approved of the bill, 38 percent. Opposition to the bill was lower, too, immediately after the House passed it: 44 percent. . . . Among Republican voters, 30 percent disapprove of the GOP health care bill. That is up from 15 percent of Republicans disapproving in early May. Moreover, independent voters disapprove of the bill by a 2-to-1 margin: 26 percent approve, versus 53 percent who disapprove. Democrats, in other words, will have something in 2018 they don’t have now — a verdict on Trumpcare. Republicans will either fail to pass something, despite the best efforts of the GOP to use Medicaid savings to give the rich big tax cuts, or they’ll pass a bill along the lines we have seen. (Leaks from the Senate negotiations indicate that the cuts to Medicaid could be even more severe in the Senate proposal.) That may take a generic 8-point advantage for Democrats even higher. In short, Republicans have to govern between now and 2018. Unless they miraculously rethink their agenda and become legislatively adept, Democrats will have concrete evidence to bolster their argument that the Republicans shouldn’t be left in control.

McConnell is turning the Senate into a knock-off of the House,"In a series of actions that threaten to break the hypocrisy meter, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who fancies himself a Senate institutionalist, in just five months has done more than any other leader to turn the world’s greatest deliberative body into a cheap knock-off of the House. The Supreme Court filibuster? Gone. The dedication to open, indeed unlimited debate, aimed to cool passions and take a more deliberative approach to legislation? Forget it. In a process that defies tradition, logic and fairness, McConnell has kept the Senate consideration of the health-care reform bill bottled up in a 13-person, closed door gaggle. He laughably claims that hearings would not have made process more transparent since all Democrats would have done is offer single-payer proposals. That’s false, and frankly, a lazy argument. To begin with, we don’t know what Democrats would have proposed, but that’s irrelevant. Extended debate is designed to give everyone time to make their case and, perhaps, to persuade or move others toward consensus. Even if they fail, they have at least had the opportunity to be heard. Moreover, open hearings would have exposed what Republicans are doing. A normal committee process akin to what was used for Obamacare would have given stakeholders the chance to weigh in, generated a timely Congressional Budget Office score, elicited reaction from defenders and critics of Obamacare and gotten input from governors. (Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper rail at the GOP shenanigans: “All Americans will come out on the losing end if we simply replace one divisive plan with another, having failed to find a bipartisan solution to bringing lasting reform that can be sustained across administrations. It will be worse yet if senators — like House members before them — decide these questions behind closed doors, avoiding the open discussion and transparency needed to make the American people full participants in this vital debate.”) McConnell has done none of that spade work. Instead he now suggests he will have a bill to present Thursday and a vote next week. It’s not clear how that is remotely possible for any number of reasons: This kind of throw-it-up-against-the-wall legislating is what we normally would expect of the House (although this Congress is worse than most). The Senate has never on such a substantial piece of legislation behaved in this fashion. Last week the Los Angeles Times reported: Major physician groups, hospitals, consumer advocates and organizations representing millions of patients with cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other serious illnesses have been pleading with Republican leaders for months to open up the process and listen to their concerns. This week, a group of more than 15 patients groups — including the American Heart Assn., the March of Dimes, the American Lung Assn. and the American Diabetes Assn. — asked McConnell’s office to meet with them next week, proposing any time between Friday and June 22. Congressional historians call the process unprecedented in its secrecy and carelessness. Of course, all that is necessary to end this travesty is three GOP senators willing to stand up and say, “No. Stop.” With only 52 Republicans in the Senate that would be sufficient to stop this reprehensible rush to decision, one that evidences little concern for one-sixth of the economy they would disrupt and for the lives of tens of millions of Americans who could be dramatically harmed. On the right, certainly, Paul, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) could put their feet down if they find the process unacceptable. Moderates such as Collins, Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) also could force the Senate to take a breather. And what about Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) the most vulnerable incumbent in the body? Surely he has the ability to stand up to object, if for no other reason than to save his own political skin. So far, this kind of independence and spine are in short supply. No one wants to be the one(s) to kill the effort, so everyone shuffles along — right over the political cliff. At least we can dispense with the fiction that the Senate is a more sober and reasoned body than the House. In conducting themselves in this way, Republican senators make the case that they are unfit to govern — and they, sadly, tarnish the Senate’s stature, perhaps permanently changing the way business is conducted.

"The Daily 202: Democrats despondent, Trump emboldened after GOP victory in Georgia special election","With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: With all the ballots counted, Republican Karen Handel won the most expensive House race in U.S. history by 3.8 percentage points. That’s a larger margin of victory than the 1.5 points that Donald Trump carried Georgia’s 6th Congressional District by last November. Handel even wound up winning by a greater margin than the GOP candidate in an unexpectedly close special election to replace OMB Director Mick Mulvaney in South Carolina that had not been on the national radar. The suburban district north of Atlanta is ruby red and has been in GOP hands since Newt Gingrich won it in 1979, but that does not make Jon Ossoff’s defeat any less devastating for Democrats struggling to find their way in the Trump era. Dem member of Congress eyeing results texts to ask Q on many Dem minds: Lots of 'moral victories.' But when do we get actual victories???"" -- Last night was a wake-up call for Democrats that they still need to home in on an effective anti-Trump message. Seth Moulton"
"In Georgia’s 6th District, is Handel’s victory of great consequence — or none at all?","As promised, the special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District was nip and tuck for much of the night. Republican Karen Handel nevertheless eked out a win over newcomer Jon Ossoff, a Democrat. In a rational political atmosphere, neither side would take great comfort from nor be seized with panic because of a race determined by a few percentage points. Indeed, it’s easy to forget that this special election took place in an overwhelmingly Republican congressional district. But with tens of millions spent on a single race, and both sides determined to extract some indication of its national fortunes — provided it won! — the hype was unstoppable. And to some degree the hype itself becomes self-fulfilling: A psychological boost surely sways candidates’ and elected officials’ behavior. A GOP win makes Republicans less nervous about sticking with President Trump on health care or other issues; a Democratic win would have encouraged nervous Republicans to break with Trump and look out for their own interests. A GOP loss would have increased the chances of more GOP retirements before 2018; a GOP win, no matter how narrow, encourages incumbents to stick around for 2018. So how do we assess the importance of the race? The rational response is that this race does not indicate either that the Republicans are cooked in 2018 nor that they can breathe a sigh of relief and continue to cling to Trump. The district, we need to remember, went to Tom Price by 23 percentage points in 2016, and to Trump by only 1.5 points. If a district rated as safely Republican in past years is now a virtual tossup, that’s one sign that Republicans under Trump have an uphill climb to reach highly educated, suburban voters. And, as the New York Times’ Alex Burns put it, “The Sixth is still a really Republican district, and the element of surprise was an asset Ossoff had in the first round but not the vote tonight.” If Democrats can be faulted, it was in unduly raising expectations in a district that is rated as 9.5 percentage points more Republican than the nation as a whole. Democrats will continue to debate whether they should focus more on health care or on Trump’s scandals and whether to veer far left or hew to the center-left. Advocates of  the health-care-heavy approach would say the results would have been different had Ossoff concentrated even more intensely on the GOP’s plans to roll back the Affordable Care Act. In reality, the Democrats did exceptionally well in a district no one would have expected them to win six months ago with an atmosphere in which both health care and Trump’s Russia scandal were front and center. Unfortunately for Democrats, the race will not resolve the internal debate as to where the party should put its emphasis. Moreover, by the time 2018 rolls around, Trumpcare will either be a reality or have crashed and burned. There are three lessons we might tentatively extract. First, we are seeing the parties divide on class and educational lines; how quickly that takes place and how effectively each party is able to find new voters while holding on to a chunk of its existing electorate will determine the results in 2018 and 2020. Second, both sides have nearly 18 months before the “real” midterms. Rather than dwell on the Georgia 6th District election, both would do well to intensify recruitment and use the remainder of the year to drive home their policy messages. Finally, we should remember that the single biggest determinant of midterm results is the favorability of the sitting president. Right now, that should keep Republicans up at night. Democrats can take solace in seeing their candidates vastly overperform in what should be easy seats for Republicans. Nevertheless, nothing can compete with tallying an outright win. A Democratic victory would have sent a wave of panic through GOP ranks. A loss leaves them anxious, if not a bit exasperated. For now, Republicans averted outright disaster.

20 GOP criticisms of Obamacare’s secrecy that now look eerily hypocritical,"House Republicans crafted a health-care bill behind closed doors and passed it quickly, and now Senate Republicans are attempting to do the same. Few GOP senators even know what's in the bill that could come to a vote next week, some GOP senators are speaking out, and analysts say the secretive nature of this process appears to be unprecedented. “I've never seen anything like it, as far as the secrecy,” Paul Ginsburg, a health policy expert at the University of Southern California, told The Fix's Amber Phillips on Monday. Over at the Monkey Cage, meanwhile, George Washington University's congressional expert Sarah Binder lays out four ways in which the secrecy goes above and beyond. That secrecy in a vacuum is one thing. But it looks infinitely worse when compared to what the GOP said about Democrats' secrecy in passing the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. And in fact, many of the GOP's passionate criticisms back then are eerily applicable to what they are doing today. Notably, the GOP repeatedly attached that secrecy argument to the unpopularity of Obamacare — arguing that Democrats were ramming through the bill because it was unpopular and because Democrats wanted to pass it without having to defend it. Fast-forward to today, and Republicans have a bill that's polling even worse than Obamacare ever did, with a Quinnipiac poll showing 57 percent of registered voters disapprove of it, vs. just 20 percent who approve. (Update: A new CBS poll shows Americans disapprove of the bill 59-32). That's pretty much exactly what the GOP is now doing: Trying to jam through the bill to get it to a conference committee where the final product will be decided. But that's not how they said business should be done in 2009 and 2010 — not by a long shot. Here's a sampling of what the GOP said less than eight short years ago about crafting massive, unpopular health-care legislation behind closed doors, and how bad that was for the American people. (Our emphases added in bold.) 1. Now-Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.): The people have a right to know what is happening behind closed doors with secret HC negotiations — JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) January 7, 2010  Cornyn on Feb. 22, 2010: “President Obama has gone behind closed doors to combine the bills passed by the House and Senate, both of which were overwhelmingly rejected by the American people, to produce yet another spending bill that will undoubtedly suffer the same fate, as well.” 2. Now-House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on March 21, 2010: “After months of twisting arms, Democratic leaders convinced enough members of their own party to defy the will of the American people and support the Senate health bill which was crafted in secret, behind closed doors.” Ryan on Feb. 24, 2010: “I share the concerns of many Americans that [the Obama administration public health-care] summit will be staged more about showmanship than true bipartisanship. While the cameras roll at the health care summit, we’re told the majority continues to meet in secret, cutting deals behind closed doors to jam a government-takeover through Congress.” 3. Now-Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who was then a Georgia congressman: With Democrats discussing health care in secret, they're sacrificing the trust of the American people. — Tom Price (@RepTomPrice) January 14, 2010  4. Now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Feb. 23, 2010: “When it comes to solving problems, Americans want us to listen first, and then, if necessary, offer targeted, step-by-step solutions. Above all, they’re tired of a process that shuts them out. They’re tired of giant bills negotiated in secret, then jammed through on a party-line vote in the middle of the night.” McConnell on Oct. 8, 2009:  … The real bill will soon be cobbled together in a secret conference room somewhere in the Capitol by a handful of Democrat senators and White House officials.” 5. Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.) on April 26"
Things just got worse for the GOP’s weakest senator,"Democrats on Monday got some good news for 2018. Politico reports: Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) plans to run against Republican Sen. Dean Heller for his Senate seat in Nevada, according to multiple people familiar with her plans. Heller is widely considered the most vulnerable Republican up for re-election in 2018 and is the only GOP senator this cycle who represents a state won by Hillary Clinton in 2016. A Public Policy Polling survey released Monday had Heller receiving just 39 percent of the vote if the match-up were held today against a generic Democrat, who earned 46 percent of support among Nevada voters. “You can’t call someone an A-list candidate who has been in office for six months and might have lost to any Republican not named [Danny] Tarkanian,” Nevada political guru Jon Ralston tweets about Rosen. “On the other hand, Rep. Jackie Rosen was perhaps the most impressive first-time candidate for Congress I have seen. And she is disciplined.” She won in 2016 in the tossup seat vacated by Sen. Joe Heck (R-Nev.), who lost his Senate race by 2.4 points to replace Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Ralston, noting that Heller is already being bombarded by negative ads, further comments, “I get the sense that this will be the longest campaign season in history, 600 days of unrelenting ads on various platforms from myriad groups targeting Heller.” He adds, “The senior senator, of course, has looked like a political corpse before — he was elected to Congress in 2006 after barely winning a primary and won election to the Senate by 12,000 votes in 2012 despite Barack Obama winning the state by 6 points.” Heller is widely seen as the weakest Republican senator on the ballot in 2018, perhaps the weakest incumbent in either party. Recently he has reluctantly signaled his agreement to roll back Medicaid expansion over a seven-year period. However, in a state where Medicaid enrollment rose 90 percent since 2013 and the rate of uninsured residents dropped by 28 percent from 2013 to 2015, Trumpcare is going to be unpopular. Sure enough, according to one polling methodology, Nevada voters oppose the American Health Care Act by a 53 to 28 percent margin. Heller’s biggest problem may be Trump, whose approval rating nationally on average is about 14 points lower than his disapproval rating. In addition to the AHCA, Trump’s budget got a frosty reception in Nevada. On the perennial issue of nuclear waste: “The budget also includes $120 million the administration is seeking to restart the licensing process for Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, identified by Congress as the permanent storage site for used nuclear fuel and other high-level radioactive waste. … Yucca Mountain is opposed by Sandoval and the majority of the state’s congressional delegation, both Republicans and Democrats.” (Heller opposes Yucca Mountain, but if he cannot halt the program — as Reid was able to do under Obama — he’ll be seen as weak and ineffective.) Other objections to the Trump budget include cuts to food stamps (“The proposed budget would also impact the food stamp program or SNAP and the nearly 440,000 SNAP recipients in Nevada as of March of this year”) and to federal land funding, a major source of revenue in the state. (“The budget also proposes cutting $230 million of funding from the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act program which uses the revenue from the sale of some public land around Las Vegas to invest in infrastructure development and wildlife restoration. … Nearly 85 percent of Nevada is managed by the federal government and the PILT program helps pay for county and state law enforcement, and infrastructure maintenance of federal land since that land can’t be developed or taxed.”) Rosen, like many Democratic challengers, will seek to tie Heller to Trump and make the election a referendum on the Trump agenda. If Trump remains as unpopular as he is, Heller will be torn between trying to shore up his GOP base and trying to distance himself from Trump. In what was once thought to be an opportunity for several Senate seat pickups for the GOP, Heller’s seat may be one of the few that changes hands. Such is the plight of an undistinguished GOP senator in the Trump years.

"Sorry, folks. The GOP’s devious strategy for ramming Trumpcare through is working.","THE MORNING PLUM: We already knew that Senate Republicans were going to try to ram through their health-care bill by resorting to a scandalously secretive, absurdly compressed process. But now we have the details: According to the Wall Street Journal, the text of the bill will be released this Thursday; the Congressional Budget Office will release a score of the bill next Monday or Tuesday; and the Senate may well vote on it next Thursday. Unfortunately, there are signs this morning that the Republican strategy is already working precisely as intended. First, let’s note that the secrecy adopted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is explicitly designed to shield the Senate GOP health-care bill from as much debate and public scrutiny as possible. The text of the bill will be available for all of one week before it is likely to be voted upon, after having been drafted in such secrecy that even Republican senators complained that they were being kept in the dark. There have not been, and apparently will not be, any hearings before the vote. What’s more, lawmakers and the public may have only two or three days to absorb the details and significance of the CBO’s conclusions. Given that this will be the most rich and detailed empirical analysis available of the bill’s likely impact on tens of millions of people and one-sixth of the U.S. economy, you’d think this document would be deserving of extensive consideration in all its complexity. But this rolling scandal doesn’t end there. This compressed schedule is not only designed to limit debate on the bill. As the Journal reports, the vote is being rushed for the express purpose of getting it done before the July 4 recess, because the failure to do so “could open Republican lawmakers up to pressure from constituents,” some of whom might be “concerned about losing their health coverage.” Thus, the schedule is also explicitly designed to shield lawmakers from public exposure and questioning about the immense human toll the measure they are considering could have — before they vote on it. A new CBS News poll finds that the public broadly wants a more open process. Americans say by 73 percent to 25 percent that Senate Republicans should discuss their plans publicly rather than privately. More than three-quarters of independents agree. But here’s the really key finding from the CBS News poll: Americans are in the dark about the measure. The poll finds that Americans say by 76-23 that they haven’t heard enough yet about the GOP plan to have a good understanding of it. Independents say this by 76-22. The juxtaposition of these findings neatly underscores the profound cynicism at the core of the GOP approach. As Brian Beutler has argued, GOP leaders are not merely lying about what is in the bill. They are also lying about the process itself, because copping to what they are actually doing would implicitly admit that their bill — which is very likely to be almost as cruel in its broad strokes as the House bill — cannot survive genuine public debate. This new polling illuminates the point: Republican leaders are willing to endure the public’s disapproval of their efforts to hide the bill from the public (to the degree that they care about that disapproval at all), precisely because those efforts are keeping the public ignorant about what they actually intend to do to our health-care system. But the cynicism and bad faith run even deeper than this. Multiple rank-and-file Republican senators also know this secrecy is indefensible — after all, they have lodged lots of public complaints about it. But they are not taking any steps to give those complaints any real force with GOP leaders. Why? The most convincing explanation is that they, too, know they are better off as long as voters — despite their disapproval of the process — don’t have a full understanding of what they will soon be voting on, and possibly, passing. It is possible, of course, that public disapproval of the secrecy of the process and of the bill itself — once we see it — could combine to dissuade a few moderate GOP senators from voting for the bill, perhaps dooming it. But nonetheless, right now, the Republicans’ blanket of secrecy is working. By keeping the public in the dark about Republicans’ true designs, it is having precisely its desired effect. * IN TRUMP ERA, SECRECY IS THE NEW NORMAL: The Post has a great piece documenting that secrecy isn’t just shrouding the health-care bill; it’s also being instituted on many other fronts by the Trump administration: Officials at numerous agencies of the Trump administration have stonewalled friendly Republicans in Congress — not to mention Democrats — by declining to share internal documents on sensitive matters or refusing to answer questions … Trump, meanwhile, is still forbidding the release of his tax returns, his aides have stopped releasing logs of visitors to the White House and his media aides have started banning cameras at otherwise routine news briefings, as happened Monday. And the drainage of the swamp continues apace. * ANOTHER POLL FINDS TRUMP APPROVAL IN THE TOILET: A new CBS News poll finds that Trump’s job approval is down to 36-57, a new low in CBS News polling. And: The drop in the President’s approval rating is partially due to ebbing support among Republicans. Seventy-two percent approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, a decline of eleven points since April. Is Trump’s awesomely rock solid base beginning to erode? * DON’T TRY TO STOP MUELLER, AMERICANS SAY: Two other important nuggets in the new CBS News poll: 56 percent of Americans say special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation will be “impartial,” and 81 percent say Trump should not try to stop his investigation. Interestingly, even 75 percent of Republicans say Trump should not try to stop Mueller’s probe, while only 20 percent of them say he should. So perhaps we should rethink this notion that Trump’s base is “rooting” for him to go full authoritarian. * SENATE WILL DEBATE HEALTH BILL FOR 20 HOURS: This is a clever juxtaposition from the New York Times: Before Congress adopted the Affordable Care Act, Democrats held numerous public hearings, and the Senate debated the measure on the floor for 25 days. Senate Republican leaders plan to push through their repeal bill under arcane budget rules that would limit debate on it to 20 hours. So there will be fewer hours of public debate on the GOP bill than there were days of debate on the ACA. * NOBODY AGREES WITH TRUMP ON CLIMATE: A new Associated Press-NORC poll finds that less than a third of Americans agree with Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, and only 18 percent think it will help the economy. And: A slim majority — 52 percent — worry that withdrawing will hurt the economy … two-thirds of Americans think climate change is happening, while about 1 in 10 think it’s not … Seven in 10 Americans think it’s a problem that the U.S. government should be working to address. Given that large majorities reject pretty much every argument he’s making about climate change and the Paris deal, maybe we’ll be able to undo the damage later. * POLLS ARE OPEN IN GEORGIA: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution describes the stakes of today’s special election between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel: Democrats hope an Ossoff victory could deal a blow to Trump’s presidency and the GOP agenda … Republicans see a Handel win as a chance to bolster incumbents in competitive districts who are nervous about allying with Trump. Ossoff … has centered his message on two audiences: There’s left-leaning voters infuriated by Trump … And there’s the moderates and independents who have backed GOP candidates but are turned off by national politics. A close finish will indicate Trump is weighing down Republicans even if Ossoff loses. But nonetheless, if Handel wins, Republicans will interpret it as a sign they can stick with Trump. * TRUMP IS UP EARLY AND WATCHING GEORGIA: Good morning, Mr. President: KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS. She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2017  It’s interesting that Trump would endorse Handel on health care, given that a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that only 1 in 4 voters in the district approve of the Trump/GOP repeal-and-replace plan.

The Health 202: Here's what we know about the Senate health-care bill,"THE PROGNOSIS The blurry outlines of an Obamacare overhaul are slowly coming into focus as Senate Republican leaders prod their members toward a health-care vote next week. But the picture is fluid. And Democrats are blasting off fireworks in the background ahead of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) July 4th deadline. McConnell is holding his plan unusually close to the vest, even for him. While leaks are common for bills of this magnitude, lawmakers and aides are being guarded in what they disclose and few of the finer details have trickled across town to K Street. We do know this: There will likely be legislation for Republicans to view this week. Much of its largest outlines will mimic the House version passed in May. Parts of it will be different. It’s almost certain to result in millions fewer Americans having insurance. It will also enact big savings for Medicaid. Here’s what we know so far  – and what we don't – about the emerging bill: 1. The bill’s 50-vote pathway to passage is most likely to circumvent Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), the two senators at each end of their party’s spectrum. Collins, a moderate, was the only Republican currently in Congress to vote against an Obamacare repeal bill in 2015, and the libertarian-minded Paul was the only one in his party to oppose a budget resolution earlier this year kicking off the whole process. If that’s the case, McConnell will have to get every single other Republican on board in the closely divided Senate (and that's counting on Vice President Pence as a tie-breaker) – including Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has lately been displaying her displeasure at how the whole health-care effort is unfolding. 2. The Senate measure seems poised to enact deeper Medicaid cuts than the House bill. The Senate bill is shaping up not only to convert Medicaid to a leaner per-capita funding system, but also tie its growth rate to an even slower-growing index than under the House version (the Consumer Price Index for urban consumers, instead of what's known as CPI-Medical). Conservative senators, most prominently Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), love this idea. 3. The Senate legislation is likely to gradually phase down the Affordable Care Act’s higher federal payments for the expanded Medicaid population. The phase down could take three years, or maybe longer. This would be a concession to moderates who don’t want to look like they’re pushing people off Medicaid too abruptly. 4. The measure seems ready to repeal or delay some or all of the ACA’s taxes. The levies that might be repealed include the ACA's health-insurance tax and a tax on medical devices -- two revenue streams the industry has vigorously lobbied to eliminate. But lawmakers have yet to make a final decision on that front. Much of the final verdict will have to do with how much funding they need to free up in order to pay for the bill’s ultimate benefits. 5. The Senate bill is likely to include a more generous version of insurance subsidies, tying them not just to age as in the House bill, but also to income. 6. The measure will likely exclude language banning federally subsidized health plans from covering abortions. The Senate parliamentarian has yet to make a final decision on whether such language is allowed under budget reconciliation rules. But from what we're hearing, even antiabortion advocates for such a ban acknowledge it's not likely to pass muster under  the so-called Byrd rules"" governing what can go in the Senate bill. Here’s something else we know: Democrats are doing all they can to get in the way. They ultimately can’t block Republicans from passing a health-care bill"
Morning Bits,"A base-pleasing tactic. “Senate Democrats are stepping up their attacks on the GOP’s push to repeal and replace ObamaCare as the legislative battle enters a critical two-week stretch. Democrats can’t block a healthcare bill on their own, but are threatening to shut down the Senate in retaliation for Republicans negotiating their legislation in a string of closed-door GOP-only meetings.” And the rest of the country should thank them. Maybe Mitch McConnell’s base buys this, but Republicans are actually trying to wreck the exchanges right now. “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said stabilizing the Obamacare insurance markets is a top priority for the GOP as it works to rewrite Obamacare, signaling the party backs subsidies for insurance companies that President Trump has threatened to withhold.” Based on this account, he’s got some explaining to do. “Michael Flynn didn’t list any interactions with foreign government officials on his application last year to renew his security clearance, despite indicating in a speech days after submitting the application that he had had extensive contacts in Saudi Arabia and other countries, according to a letter Monday from two senior House Democrats.” If you base performance on retaining one’s integrity, the defense secretary is the star of the Cabinet. “Supporters of [Jim] Mattis, across both parties, hope his patriotism will gird him through the choppy waters, and collective fingers across Washington remain crossed that he stays on the job. Yet, as one Republican senator who traveled overseas with him said recently, ‘It’s getting harder every week.’ ” Based on Sean Spicer’s experience, many capable people won’t want to apply. “White House press secretary Sean Spicer is leading a search for his own replacement on the briefing room podium as part of a larger plan to shake up the White House communications operation, according to two people with knowledge of the effort. Last week, Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus reached out to Fox News contributor Laura Ingraham about the role of press secretary and Daily Mail U.S. political editor David Martosko about the role of communications director, according to a White House official.” What an awful idea, putting a right-wing talk show host who has zero credibility at the podium. To base foreign policy on the notion that human rights can be divorced from national self-interest is lunacy. “The American Student Released From North Korea Has Died. … A statement from President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump offered their condolences to the Warmbier family. ‘Otto’s fate deepens my Administration’s determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency,’ the statement read.” That would have greater meaning if he didn’t give human rights the back of the hand in foreign policy. If you based your vote on fear that Hillary Clinton was some sort of war-monger who’d get us sucked into more combat, you were conned. “The United States is becoming more perilously drawn into Syria’s fragmented war as it fights on increasingly congested battlefields surrounding Islamic State territory. On Sunday, a U.S. fighter jet downed a Syrian warplane for the first time in the conflict. By Monday, a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad, Russia, had suspended a pact used to prevent crashes with the U.S.-led coalition in the skies over Syria and was threatening to target American jets.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

The Daily 202: Most Republicans in the Georgia special election are willing to give Trumpcare a chance,"With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: CHAMBLEE, Ga. — Obamacare has been front and center in Republican campaign commercials for the past four election cycles, but it’s been absent from the airwaves ahead of today’s special election in Georgia’s 6th District. Most of the GOP spots have focused on national security. A relentless barrage of attacks ads sought to define Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff, 30, as an inexperienced and liberal carpetbagger who would be a puppet of Nancy Pelosi. This is ironic because the neck-and-neck race to replace Tom Price, who resigned to become secretary of health and human services, has played out against the backdrop of Congress finally considering a repeal of the 2010 law. Senate Republicans are forging ahead with plans to hold a vote next week, and Democrats are now using every procedural trick available to slow the chamber to a crawl so they can draw attention to the secretive process being used to advance the legislation. Politically, it is sensible for GOP outside groups to steer clear of this issue in their paid media. An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found that just one-quarter of likely voters in the costliest House race in U.S. history approve of the Republicans' American Health Care Act. But the polling does not capture the full story. In dozens of interviews on the ground over three days, most Republicans and many independents who have concerns about the House bill stressed that they still detest Obamacare. Their expectations might seem unreasonable to anyone who is closely following the debate or is steeped in the complexities of public policy, but they believe Donald Trump can and should enact a replacement plan that will both reduce their costs and improve their quality of care. No matter where people fall in the debate, virtually everyone cares deeply about the outcome. The Journal-Constitution survey, conducted the week before last, found that 81 percent of likely voters describe health care as an “extremely” or “very” important “priority” to them, larger than any other issue by far. -- One reason a lot of Republicans in the suburbs north of Atlanta are willing to give Trump leeway is Price. After representing the district for 12 years, he is still highly respected by the grass roots. He won reelection by 23 points last November, even as Trump edged out Hillary Clinton by just one point. Lynda Chapman, a trained pharmacist who has a master’s degree in health-care policy, expressed confidence that any repeal bill will be good so long as Price signs off on it. “I’ve known Tom Price for over 20 years,” she said. “He’s a good man and has a good heart. You have to trust him because he knows what he’s doing.” She said this after watching Price speak at a rally for Republican candidate Karen Handel. The HHS secretary began his speech in an airplane hangar here on Saturday by noting that he had come in his “personal capacity.” He made just one passing reference to the health debate in his remarks. Even then, it was part of a laundry list. Between calls for lower taxes and stronger national security, he said: “And you all want patient-centered health care.” That was it. In a six-minute speech peppered with y’all’s, Handel also never mentioned Trump or health care. “We’re going to show up on Tuesday, and we’re going to rock Nancy Pelosi’s world,” she said. -- When asked, Handel says she would have voted for the House bill because it’s better than the status quo. “It is by no means a perfect bill, but it was important to get the process started,” she told me before she held a meet-and-greet at a restaurant. “And the process couldn’t begin until we had a bill that was passed, right? So there’s some good things in it: Being able to keep people on their parents’ plan until they’re 26, I think most people are A-okay with that. A lot of people ask me: Why can’t we fix it? Well, we can’t fix something that had the largest tax increase embedded in it in my lifetime [a reference to the individual mandate]. The only way to fix a tax increase is to repeal it.” “One thing I trust the Senate will deal with is making sure that states that didn’t expand Medicaid shouldn’t be at a disadvantage versus other states,” Handel added. “So fix that. Make sure that the language on preexisting conditions is exactly right. As I read it, there are richer protections for people with preexisting conditions in the House bill than there were previously. From a practical standpoint, there are things they can do to give it a good solid foundation to keep moving forward.” -- The bill was a flashpoint in the debates, as Ossoff argued that the legislation “guts protections for preexisting conditions.” He told the story of a 7-year-old boy who has a heart condition and might struggle to get insurance if the bill became law. “We need to fix Obamacare, not repeal it,” the former House staffer says in one of his ads. -- The legislation has certainly helped galvanize Democratic energy. Melissa Holloway, 32, is a registered nurse who works with Medicaid recipients. The Democrat wore a “Not My President” T-shirt as she joined two dozen friends for an impromptu protest outside Price’s rally for Handel. “I believe health care is a human right,” she said. “Most of the people who are going to be hurt by Trumpcare are already disadvantaged. … That’s what real terrorism looks like.” -- Republican activist Angie Caswell, 42, wandered outside to engage with these protesters. She earnestly wanted to understand how they could possibly think Obamacare was working. Her deductibles have skyrocketed in recent years, she said, and she’s heard horror stories about doctors going out of business. “I only know one person who has benefited from Obamacare,” she said. The mental health counselor, a native of Sweden who became a U.S. citizen in 2004, calls herself “ultra-conservative” and strongly supports the president. “Trump wants to put something together that’s actually going to last and work for everybody,” Caswell explained. “To do that, you have to start over. That’s what they’re doing.” She said the protesters’ concerns about people with preexisting conditions losing coverage are unfounded because, surely, Trump would never allow such a terrible thing to happen to people who need help. “That’s definitely one of the things he’s going to make sure they fix,” she said, referring to the Senate bill. “I’m sure Trump has scratched his head on that one a lot.” -- The Congressional Leadership Fund has spent $7 million to keep this seat in GOP hands, including a field program that has 135 paid door-knockers. For the past two months, the super PAC aligned with Paul Ryan has focused its efforts on mobilizing a universe of about 38,000 Republicans who voted in the 2016 presidential primary but not in the crowded April primary for this election. If these lower-propensity voters show up, the district is red enough that Handel will win. I joined Chase McGrath, 18, on one of his door-knocking shifts. He just graduated from high school and will attend Georgetown this fall. Walking down streets lined with pine cones and red dirt in Roswell, he urged these targeted voters to take the time to turn out for Handel. Canvassers for CLF had previously knocked on many of these doors twice. This was the final push to drive them to the polls. “There’s a lot of people who are just ready for the election to happen,” McGrath said. One of the Republicans he connected with was Karen Shandor, a registered nurse, who decided to vote for Handel after watching her promise to cut taxes during one of the televised debates. She thinks having another Republican in Congress will help Trump advance his agenda. “I’m having a really hard time. My money doesn’t go as far as it used to,” she said. “We may not see changes right away with what Trump is doing, but I feel like in the long run it will benefit us.” Shandor used to work in an emergency room and complained that undocumented immigrants from Mexico would always get medical care with no questions asked. She said she resents freeloaders and explained that she supports the House bill because her understanding is that it will make Mexicans pay more for their health care. “I didn’t have a child because I didn’t know if I could afford it,” the 58-year-old said as she took a break from tending to her vegetable garden. “But Mexican kids in the country illegally are automatically covered. Hopefully that changes.” -- L.B. Jamieson, 49, sells cement trucks and hates Obamacare. She considers herself an independent, backs Handel and suggests she will be deeply disillusioned if congressional Republicans do nothing to get rid of the law. “I have to pay a $40 co-pay just to see a doctor,” the Republican said. “It’s not affordable.… I’d rather pay the fine.” “Donald Trump was not my first choice, but I went with him because he knows what he’s doing, and he’s a successful businessman,” Jamieson explained as she dipped a pita chip into hummus at Marlow’s Tavern in Johns Creek during a date with her boyfriend. “I don’t think he’s always making the best choices, but at the same time he’s done more in his first 100 days than any president ever before.” I asked what specifically Jamieson was thinking of when she said that. “Just research it,” she said. “I’m not going to get into it, but it’s the truth. It’s factual. Just look it up.” -- Trump tweeted support for the GOP nominee last night, but he spelled her name wrong: “Karen Handle's opponent in #GA06 can't even vote in the district he wants to represent....” He deleted that and reposted it with the right spelling. He also acknowledged the wider implications of the race: “The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P’s. Vote now for Karen H.” He posted again this morning: KAREN HANDEL FOR CONGRESS. She will fight for lower taxes, great healthcare strong security-a hard worker who will never give up! VOTE TODAY -- The bottom line: If Handel loses tonight, it will be almost entirely because of moderate unease with Trump and his agenda. The Journal-Constitution poll found that only about one-third of voters in the district approve of the president. Even one in four Republicans give him an unfavorable review. Demographics are key: While Trump pulled just 48 percent in the district last November, Mitt Romney got 61 percent in 2012. That swing, one of the biggest in the country, is why Democrats aggressively targeted the race early on. Republicans only represent two of the 15 House districts with the highest percentage of adults who have a college degree. Georgia’s 6th is one of them. (The other is Virginia’s 10th, which includes tony D.C. suburbs like McLean and is held by Barbara Comstock.) Obviously, Trump would never acknowledge that his unpopularity is why his party lost an election. So it shouldn’t be surprising that the White House is already telegraphing plans to blame others if Handel goes down. “Inside the West Wing, Trump and his advisers have paid increasing attention to the race and have been briefed regularly on Handel’s standing in private polls, GOP ground efforts and early-vote totals,” Bob Costa reports. “Associates of Trump — who have said he is already furious over the focus on his handling of investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election — warned that an Ossoff win could spark new rage toward Handel’s campaign and the way the GOP handled the race.” WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE NATIONAL HEALTH-CARE DEBATE: -- Senate Republican leaders are moving forward with plans to hold a vote next week, even though they still aren’t sure they’ll have the 50 votes to pass anything. The Wall Street Journal reports: “Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is intent on keeping pressure on Senate Republicans to move quickly on the bill rolling back and replacing much of the 2010 health law, lawmakers and GOP aides said. The push for a quick vote before the weeklong July 4 recess could backfire, however, as some conservative and centrist Republicans have expressed concern about the emerging shape of the legislation. … Still, Mr. McConnell has reasons to try for a quick health-care vote. The pressure could force lawmakers to reach a consensus on sticking points that have divided them. And GOP leaders in both chambers want to move on to other legislative items.” -- Senate Democrats ramped up opposition Monday to the emerging bill with a series of mostly symbolic moves, including speeches that went late into last night. “At one point early Monday evening, more than a dozen Democratic senators sat at their desks on the Senate floor and took turns standing and asking for committee hearings on the bill and for the text to be released for greater scrutiny,” Sean Sullivan reports. -- Democrats hope that, if they can block a Senate vote before July 4, the August recess will stifle GOP momentum and make it much harder to get final passage. The New York Times reports: “Lawmakers would have just three weeks to pass a Senate bill and work out differences with the House before the planned August recess (assuming a bill passes the Senate). The Trump administration also wants Congress to raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit before August, another fight that could collide with the Affordable Care Act repeal.” -- One problem: Senate Dems aren’t unified about the approach. Politico reports: “(Leadership) wants to use every procedural tool at their disposal to slow the GOP’s progress, but one of their more arcane options — the power to block committee meetings two hours after the Senate goes into session — risks inviting Republicans to paint them as heedlessly obstructionist.” -- Liberal activist groups are planning a big national “day of action” around health care on July 29, the first day of the congressional summer recess. But if Senate Republicans have their way, Obamacare will already be gone by then, Mike DeBonis notes. -- Some Republicans are beginning to talk publicly about canceling the August congressional recess so that they can get a bill done. The Hill: “A Senate GOP aide expressed doubt, however, that David Perdue, Dan Sullivan and Steve Daines will get very far in convincing McConnell to cancel the recess.” -- The contents of the Senate bill remain tightly under wraps, which defies tradition but could establish a new norm if it works. Amber Phillips reports: “There are always some kinds of closed-door negotiations on big pieces of legislation. But at this point in the 2009-2010 debate for the Affordable Care Act, there had been months of public committee hearings that you and I could attend or watch online or read about in the news. Senators had been briefed on what was happening and could answer reporters' questions instead of saying they have no idea what's in the bill. Amendments were offered by both sides.” But if the bill makes it through despite the secrecy, “that would be a remarkable change in the way legislation is debated and passed. And it would be a very tantalizing path for both sides to take in the future.” -- As the bill’s contents remain unclear, some reports suggest that the Senate may vote to cut Medicaid by even more than the $800 billion that the House approved last month. The Hill reports: “The proposal would start out the growth rate for a new cap on Medicaid spending at the same levels as the House bill, but then drop to a lower growth rate that would cut spending more, known as CPI-U, starting in 2025.… That proposal has been sent to the Congressional Budget Office for analysis, a Senate GOP aide said. The aide said that plan has been described as a ‘consensus option that has been sent to CBO,’ though no final decision has been made yet. Another aide said there are still other options in the mix. Democrats and some more moderate Republicans were already warning about Medicaid cuts in the House-passed bill.” -- New polling released by the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling shows that the House bill is deeply unpopular in three states with GOP senators who could torpedo the legislation: Alaska, Nevada and West Virginia. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- Otto Warmbier, the University of Virginia student who was imprisoned by North Korea for nearly a year and a half before being medically evacuated and returned home in a coma last week, has died. He was 22. Susan Svrluga and Anna Fifield report: Warmbier had gone to North Korea on his way to Hong Kong for a study-abroad program"
How will we miss Congress if it doesn’t go away?,"The worst-kept secret in Washington is that the Senate’s  secret health-care discussions almost certainly won’t produce a health-care bill, let alone one that can pass, in the two weeks before the July 4 congressional holiday recess. The Hill reports that some GOP senators are pushing to cancel or shorten the August recess (scheduled for the entire month): “With the party still sharply divided on healthcare and tax reform, it looks increasingly possible that Republican lawmakers will leave town in July for a monthlong break without any major accomplishments under their belts.” There are plenty of reasons why this is unlikely to happen. It’s not even clear that staying in the District would be a good thing for Republicans. First, as much as lawmakers fear raucous town halls where angry voters berate them for accomplishing nothing (or in the House for passing a monstrous health-care bill), the bigger fear is losing face time back home, not to mention the opportunity to meet with donors. Lawmakers unfortunately have become adept at avoiding large meetings with constituents and can project the appearance of access by holding smaller group meetings, many of which get little or no national coverage. No incumbent on the ballot in 2018 wants his or her opponent to claim the voters’ representative “never comes home” or has become “out of touch” with the district or state. Second, the problem for the Senate is not simply a lack of time but rather the absence of a workable consensus on health-care legislation. Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and perhaps others want no guaranteed tax credit to subsidize people who cannot get health insurance through their employers. Several senators (e.g. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Susan Collins (R-Maine)) insist on funding Planned Parenthood, which is anathema to most of the 52 GOP senators. The likelihood of them reaching agreement with just a few more weeks of wrangling is not high. We’ve yet to see a bill that could gain support, say, from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.). Third, any bill that would come up for a vote would put numerous senators in a tight spot when it comes to Medicaid. Senators in states where Medicaid expansion has extended coverage to large numbers of people are reluctant to return to the pre-Obamacare era. Thirty-one states plus the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, sweeping tens of millions of people into the system. (According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid enrollment before Obamacare was approximately 57 million; after Obamacare, the number rose to 74.6 million, an increase of 30 percent.) Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who will be up for reelection in 2018, represents a state where the Medicaid rolls went up 90 percent. In other words, no deal is probably preferable to explaining to governors, state lawmakers and ordinary voters that the poorest residents — or people who could find themselves in a similar situation in the future — are not going to have coverage. Fourth, the longer Congress remains in session, the bigger and easier a target members become for the Democrats’ planned Resistance Summer, a nationwide grass-roots movement that will target Obamacare. The presence of lawmakers working hard to reduce or eliminate coverage is the best recruiting tool Democrats have. Each detail that leaks out becomes grist for the Democrats’ mill. Now, there might be reason to curtail the August recess if the subject is not health care. A health-care bill that would be passed by budget reconciliation requires, well, a budget. It’s far from clear now that Republicans have the ability to forge a budget deal and keep the government running when the fiscal year runs out on Sept. 30. If Congress takes its full August recess, it won’t have much time according to the current calendar to pass a budget. The House will of course insist on including its health-care proposal while the Senate may or may not have something. Dicey issues including defense spending will remain. Put differently, if the Congress doesn’t get to work early, it’s entirely possible it will not pass a budget, let alone tax reform or anything else it has on the agenda. That means either a continuing resolution or a shutdown, neither of which demonstrate the GOP is capable of governance. In sum, strong reasons abound for Congress to put health care aside if the Senate comes up empty in the next couple of weeks. However, responsible leaders who want to avoid a budget disaster, or maybe even work on tax reform, might think about calling its members back before Labor Day.

Democrats are ramping up their tactics against the GOP health bill. Here’s the only way it will work.,"The fate of the American health care system is going to be decided in the next two weeks. Whether tens of millions of people lose their coverage, whether we transform Medicaid (which now serves 70 million Americans) into something smaller and stingier, whether we all lose the measure of security we just got a few years ago, it’s all on the line. Today, Democrats in Congress say they are prepared to try new tactics in order to stop the bill that Mitch McConnell and the Republicans are determined to pass through the Senate. According to a senior Democratic aide, they’ll be doing the following: “These are merely the first steps we’re prepared to take in order to shine a light on this shameful Trumpcare bill and reveal to the public the GOP’s true intentions: to give the uber-wealthy a tax break while making middle class Americans pay more for less health care coverage,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “If Republicans won’t relent and debate their health care bill in the open for the American people to see, then they shouldn’t expect business as usual in the Senate.” Will it work? They might succeed, but it won’t be easy — and it will depend on everyone involved understanding that there’s only one real path to victory. Something extraordinary and unprecedented is happening right now. A group of 13 Republican senators is writing a bill in secret that will remake the entire health care system. There will be no hearings and no expert testimony. No committee will consider the bill. Even Republican senators outside that small group don’t know exactly what’s in it. And they want to pass it in the next two weeks, in the obvious hope that it will all be done before the public even notices let alone understands how much the bill would hurt them. And even though the details are still opaque, we already know that the bill will be impossibly cruel; today we learned that the Senate may be making even deeper cuts to Medicaid than the odious House bill. So how do Democrats stop it? As I’ve been arguing, whether it looks like the Democrats are “fighting” is less important than whether their specific tactics are likely to achieve their goal. Today, we found out what those tactics in the Senate are going to be. Now, none of these actions will actually stop the Senate bill — at least not yet — in part because as of now there is no bill. At times like this one can fall into the trap of confusing means and ends, seeing a tactic that gets a lot of media coverage as a successful achievement of the goal. Media coverage is critical, but it’s important to keep in mind that there is one — and only one — mechanism by which this bill can be defeated. For every parliamentary maneuver Democrats employ to slow things down, there’s another maneuver McConnell can come up with to move the bill forward. Eventually, there will be a vote if McConnell wants one. The only way Democrats win in the end is if three or more Republican senators decide to vote No. Any strategy has to work backward from that outcome. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the Senate. If three of them object, the bill is dead. There are only about a half-dozen senators who might pull their support — a couple of moderates like Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and a few senators from states where the citizenry has benefited hugely from the ACA, particularly its expansion of Medicaid. Those include Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Jeff Flake of Arizona, and a couple others. Democratic groups are already running TV ads targeted at those senators. But there is a very specific series of events that would have to occur for the Senate Democrats’ strategy to be successful. Here’s how it has to work: We have to be clear that like most incumbent politicians, Senate Republicans truly fear only one thing: the displeasure of their constituents. That’s why numbers 5 and 6 are the most critical links in this chain. If the senators aren’t feeling pressure from their constituents, they’ll think they can get away with passing this bill and they won’t be punished for it. So the delaying tactics Democrats employ are useful only insofar as they generate attention and opposition among the public. The good news for Democrats is that like the House bill, the Senate bill will be an abomination. That’s why Republicans are working so hard to keep it secret and vote on it as fast as possible: they know that if the public gets a good look at it, they’ll be horrified. If Democrats can force it into the light, they have a chance to defeat it. But it will all come down to the question of how threatened a few Republican senators feel.

Dirty attack ad could backfire in Georgia’s high-profile 6th District race,"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports: Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel strongly condemned an attack ad that surfaced Sunday accusing the “unhinged left” of endorsing violence against Republicans days before the nationally-watched race to represent Georgia’s 6th District is decided. The ad, funded by a little-known group called the Principled PAC, opens with sounds of gunshots and footage of U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise being wheeled away on a stretcher after he and other members of the Republican congressional baseball team were ambushed by a lone gunman while practicing in a Washington suburb. “The man is fighting for his life,” Ossoff said Sunday after a campaign stop. “I think it’s disgraceful to politicize it, and I think Secretary Handel should call for it to come down.” For reasons that perplex many onlookers, a Handel spokeswoman did not call for the ad to be taken down, and merely called it “disturbing and disgusting.” As a moral and political matter, this seems to be a poor move that underestimates public disgust with vitriol and the politicization of violence. Handel’s refusal to issue a full-throated denunciation and demand for the ad to be taken down comes across as a wink-wink to the far right. In a district filled with upscale, highly educated voters whose rising discontent with President Trump has fueled Ossoff’s rise, Handel’s halfhearted approach may only remind voters that she willingly campaigned with Trump and has refused to repudiate his policies. Moreover, a final tweet from Trump backing her candidacy might do as much harm as good in the race. It’s not clear whether this final incident will make a difference in Tuesday’s highly anticipated special election, which has already beaten all spending records for a congressional district race and generated a stampede of early voters. Nevertheless, in a close race, as this is expected to be, virtually any event can tip the scales. Should Ossoff win, Republicans on the ballot in 2018 (or considering retirement) will get a jolt. If a congressional district that Tom Price won by 23 points in 2016 goes to a Democrat in a race with a candidate who failed to distance herself from Trump and his policies and didn’t do her utmost to repudiate egregious rhetoric, you can bet that there will be more congressmen and senators willing to rebuke Trump and distance themselves from his policies. In the GA-6 race, one poll shows more than 80 percent of voters consider health care the top issue; a loss for the GOP in that setting will set off a round of second-guessing about Trumpcare. Watch for the Republicans in competitive seats who decide to retire, a sure sign of flagging optimism about the party’s chances. Should Handel win, Democrats will try to reassure one another that this is a “9.5-plus” Republican district — far more Republican than tens of districts that could be in play in 2018. Nevertheless, a loss here for Democrats would likely set off a new round of recriminations. Does the party need a stronger, affirmative message? Would it do better with candidates to the left of a centrist like Ossoff? In sum, the GA-6 won’t necessarily be predictive of 2018. However, in the short run, it’s likely to dominate the political discussion at exactly the same time the Senate is contemplating a secretive, rushed process on health care. If nothing else, it may determine just how many Republicans decide to hang it up before the next election.

"Trump exploited the cultural divide, not economic unfairness","If you listened to President Trump supporters and a great deal of the media (both mainstream and right-wing) analyzing the 2016 presidential race you would think Trump won the presidency because he understood the economic hardship of those in rural and small-town America. His base was made up of people hurt by globalization and de-industrialization in the heartland, the story goes. The traditional GOP and the Democratic Party, you see, didn’t understand this or care about their plight. We’ve never really bought that explanation, in part because Trump voters on average were richer than Hillary Clinton voters. Now there is powerful evidence of a disagreeable truth: Trump’s base was far more motivated by cultural provincialism and xenophobia than by economic need. The Post reports that the “popular explanations of the rural-urban divide appear to overstate the influence of declining economic outcomes in driving rural America’s support for Trump. The survey responses, along with follow-up interviews and focus groups in rural Ohio, bring into view a portrait of a split that is tied more to social identity than to economic experience.” Economic dislocation does not seem to have been the main factor in the election: Rural Americans express far more concern about jobs in their communities, but the poll finds that those concerns have little connection to support for Trump, a frequent theory to explain his rise in 2016. Economic troubles also show little relation to the feeling that urban residents have different values. Rural voters who lament their community’s job prospects report supporting Trump by 14 percentage points more than Clinton, but Trump’s support was about twice that margin — 30 points — among voters who say their community’s job opportunities are excellent or good. Trump also earned about the same level of support from those who say they don’t worry about paying their bills as those who couldn’t pay their bills at some point in the past year. If not economics per se, what was the origin of the sharp electoral divide between rural and urban voters? Attitudes on race, culture and immigration seem to predominate: The poll reveals that perceptions about abuse of government benefits often go hand in hand with views about race. When asked which is more common — that government help tends to go to irresponsible people who do not deserve it or that it doesn’t reach people in need — rural Americans are more likely than others to say they think people are abusing the system. And across all areas, those who believe irresponsible people get undeserved government benefits are more likely than others to think that racial minorities receive unfair privileges. In response to this poll question — “Which of these do you think is the bigger problem in this country: blacks and Hispanics losing out because of preferences for whites, or whites losing out because of preferences for blacks and Hispanics?” — rural whites are 14 points less likely than urban whites to say they are more concerned about blacks and Hispanics losing out. While rural Americans may reside in close-knit, overwhelmingly Christian communities, they see themselves as victims in a war against religion. “Nearly 6 in 10 people in rural areas say Christian values are under attack, compared with just over half of suburbanites and fewer than half of urbanites. When personal politics is taken into account, the divide among rural residents is even larger: 78 percent of rural Republicans say Christian values are under attack, while 45 percent of rural Democrats do.” Trump magnificently exploited the resentments of white Christians and their anxiety about cities, which he falsely portrayed as experiencing a crime wave. He also played into negative feelings about immigrants held by people who didn’t have much contact with immigrants. “Rural residents are more likely than people in cities or suburbs to think that immigrants are not adapting to the American way of life. The poll also finds that these views soften in rural areas with significant foreign-born populations.” They harbor strong feelings that are not the result of actual experience: Rural residents are also more likely to say that recent immigrants have different values than their own — 50 percent, compared with 39 percent of urban residents. Trump voters in rural areas are the most critical: 74 percent say recent immigrants are not doing enough to assimilate to life in America vs. 49 percent of rural Americans overall who think that, as well. One reason for rural Americans’ concern about immigrants could be their lack of exposure to them. Foreign-born residents make up 2.3 percent of the population in rural counties, compared with nearly 15 percent of urban counties, according to Census Bureau data for 2011-2015. . . . The Post-Kaiser poll finds that in rural areas where less than 2 percent of the population are immigrants, less than 4 in 10 residents say immigrants strengthen the country. But that rises to nearly 6 in 10 in rural areas where at least 5 percent are born outside the United States. Resentment and hysteria over cities and immigrants have been building for years, egged on by talk radio and Fox News and by anti-immigrant groups (e.g., FAIR, NumbersUSA). Trump simply took it to a new level of demagoguery divorced from reality. As we reenter a national conversation about anger, polarization and rhetorical excess we should expect more diligent, reasoned behavior from both politicians and voters. It is a gross exaggeration to tell rural voters that Christianity is under assault because they cannot dominate societal rules (e.g., businesses cannot discriminate against LGBT customers, official organized school prayer violates the First Amendment). It’s flat-out false to say we are being swamped by illegal immigrants. This sort of propaganda lacks a grounding in reality and amps up the already dangerous political environment, which in turn paralyzes our democracy. Inhabitants of cities are no less or more “American” than rural dwellers, and because of real-life experience display on average more tolerant attitudes toward immigrants. Rural communities have every right to demand adequate services. (Unfortunately, Trump policies make life harder for them. Trumpcare would make their health care more expensive; privatizing the air traffic control system would make airports scarcer in these areas.)  Like other Americans, they deserve empathy for the conditions that afflict many communities (drug addiction, soaring rates of those on disability). However, rural voters must, like all Americans, eschew bigotry and reject prevalent conspiracy theories that would alleviate them from personal responsibility for their life choices.

"Yes, Mitch McConnell’s secretive lawmaking is really unusual — in these 4 ways","Directed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a dozen or so Republican senators have spent weeks behind closed doors crafting a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Republicans have not held any committee hearings or legislative drafting sessions for the bill, and Democrats are shut out. Even some Republicans complain they’re in the dark about their own party’s bill. Dealmaking behind closed doors is common in the contemporary Congress. Still, the GOP’s extreme secrecy in hammering out a health-care deal strikes me as different in both degree and kind from past practice. Is this a legitimate approach, and can it succeed? Why party leaders like secrecy A generation ago, even before Watergate, Congress and the president enacted a number of “sunshine” reforms so citizens could follow the legislative process far more easily. In particular, Congress in 1970 put in new rules that made it harder for committee chairs to close hearings to the public, put individual lawmakers’ votes on the record immediately for public review and generally adopted more transparent procedures. [This is why Trump’s legislative agenda is stuck in neutral] Since then, rising ideological and partisan conflict has pushed congressional leaders back toward opacity. Especially in the House, as political scientist James Curry shows in “Legislating in the Dark,” majority party leaders often limit lawmakers’ access to information on the majority’s high-priority measures, such as the economic stimulus bill adopted in 2009 in the immediate wake of the financial crisis. More and more, House leaders have been releasing bills right before they’re called up on the floor to defang opponents and limit defections from their own party. Limiting transparency with procedural sleight of hand, Curry shows, increases the party’s chances of success. Even on bipartisan measures, House and Senate leaders prefer to manage all the bargaining behind closed doors. With no ideological sweet spot linking the parties, successful deals — such as the bipartisan budget deals in 2013 and 2015 — require “win-win” bargains: Each party gets its top priority and, in exchange, allows the other party to get its top priority. But negotiating win-win deals requires secrecy. If information leaks out about the less popular parts of a deal before the various constituencies hear about the parts they want, the entire negotiation can blow up. Closing the doors lets negotiators knit together an entire agreement before shaking hands. As the negotiators’ adage goes, “Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to.” So what’s different about McConnell’s ploy? Still, McConnell’s tactics on health care stand out from other secret dealmaking. First, most closed-door bargaining in the Senate is bipartisan. True, Republicans are trying to repeal the ACA under special budget rules that eliminate the need for Democratic votes. Even so, it is highly unusual for the majority party’s senators to be kept in the dark on a top party priority. Even if House leaders often limit information on pending measures, McConnell’s tactics are far out of the norm for the upper chamber. [The Congressional Budget Office will probably survive Republican attacks. Here’s why.] Second, when leaders close the doors, it’s often because the legislative process has ground to a halt. For example, negotiations over federal discretionary spending often take place in secret — but only after the annual appropriations process falters. But on health care, Senate Republicans went straight to closed-door negotiations among their own factions, without even trying to move the House bill — or their own alternative — through the usual public drafting and amending sessions in committee. Third, McConnell’s tactics are particularly unusual because Republicans are trying to legislate on one of the nation’s most complicated policy issues. Health care affects one-sixth of the economy and may have life-or-death consequences for many Americans on Obamacare. Usually, issues that demand secret negotiations are must-pass measures about to hit a nonnegotiable deadline, such as failing to raise the debt ceiling or to fund the government on time. When the stakes are high and the consequences of failure broadly considered unacceptable, hiding negotiations from the public is usually easier to justify. Fourth, it’s true that senators have in the past often resorted to small, bipartisan groups (such as the “Gang of Six” that struggled over health care in 2009 and the “Gang of Eight” that struck an immigration deal in 2013) working in secret on controversial policy matters. Even so, bipartisan deals that emerge from these “gangs” are usually then defended in public in committee and on the floor — and McConnell has said he won’t do that in this case. Will McConnell back down? McConnell holds his cards very close to his vest. But at this stage, he seems unlikely to back down under public pressure to open up the legislative process. First, given the extreme unpopularity of the bill that the House passed, sunshine can only hurt GOP efforts to deliver on their promise to their base to repeal and replace Obamacare. A Senate deal could have fewer rough edges than the House bill, but it is still likely to be deeply unpopular. [We learned these 3 things from Republicans’ failure to repeal Obamacare] Second, no matter how intense public or Democratic pressure might be, McConnell doesn’t have to worry about objections from anyone other than fellow Senate Republicans. McConnell can pass any bill so long as he has 50 Republican votes — meaning he can afford to lose no more than two of 52 Republican senators. And so the only thing that can influence him are GOP threats to withhold votes. Third, keeping a tight lid on negotiations limits interference from President Trump, who reportedly called the House health-care bill — which he himself celebrated in the Rose Garden — “mean.” Less interference gives McConnell a better shot at crafting a bill that’s likely to pass. And for Republicans, that’s what it’s all about. "
The Health 202: Trump's health care evolution can be traced in his tweets,"THE PROGNOSIS President Trump has showered praise upon the GOP bill to overhaul Obamacare. He threw a big Rose Garden celebration once the House passed it. He promised it would transform the nation’s health-care system into one of the world’s finest. And yesterday, behind closed doors, he told a group of Senate Republicans it is “mean.” Trump apparently critiqued the health-care bill passed by House Republicans in front of more than a dozen senators he hosted for lunch at the White House. The president said the senators should make their own version “more generous,” according to congressional sources who leaked to the Associated Press. That's pretty different from what Trump said when the cameras were turned on. He had some tart words for Democrats, instead: Of course, the GOP senators didn't share those comments with the press, either. Conference Chair John Thune (R-S.D.), who attended the lunch, said Trump talked about “making sure that we have a bill that protects people with preexisting conditions” and how to design a tax credit for purchasing insurance that works for lower-income and elderly people in particular, my colleagues Kelsey Snell and Sean Sullivan report. “I think he realizes, you know, our bill is going to move, probably, from where the House was and he seems fine with that,” Thune said. “He talked about making sure that we have a bill that protects people with preexisting conditions.” It's hardly surprising that Trump would privately feel this way about the House's American Health Care Act, which is projected to leave 23 million more Americans without health coverage. After all, Trump was a longtime advocate of government-run health-care programs in many other developed countries. In his book The America We Deserve"
The Daily 202: Leftward lurch in Democratic gubernatorial primary reflects the transformation of Virginia,"With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Today’s Democratic primary for Virginia governor between Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello can be viewed through many lenses: establishment vs. insurgent, outsider vs. insider, radical vs. incremental, patrician vs. progressive, neo-populist vs. practiced pragmatist. Some pundits frame the race as some sort of proxy rematch of Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders. Others say it’s more like Clinton versus Barack Obama circa 2008. With polls showing Northam and Perriello running neck-and-neck, what’s been most striking in the homestretch is how far left both have come. While some of the posturing is certainly about trying to ride the wave of resistance to Donald Trump and appeal to base voters in a low-turnout primary, the journeys both have taken over the past decade tell a larger story about how much the state of Virginia has transformed, from red to purple to maybe even slightly blue. Northam acknowledges that he voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. Republicans aggressively wooed him as a freshman state senator in 2009 to defect from the Democratic Party. He ran for LG four years ago as a fiscal conservative and moderate. Perriello was a one-term wonder in the U.S. House. In 2008, he toppled a longtime incumbent in a ruby-red congressional district around Charlottesville that included the University of Virginia. When students came out in droves to vote for the hope and change offered by Obama, Perriello rode his coattails. Two years later, he got swept out by the tea party wave. If you watch TV in the D.C. media market, you’ve heard he lost his seat because he voted for Obamacare.  That’s true. But he voted for an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have prevented any federal subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion. Perriello won the National Rifle Association’s endorsement when he ran for Congress after praising the group as “the epitome of people-powered politics.” Now he blasts the NRA as “a nut-job extremist organization.” Perriello also signed on with a group of Republican lawmakers to support oil and gas drilling off Virginia’s coast as a congressman. Now he’s “very skeptical” about offshore drilling. -- Virginia was the only Southern state Clinton won last November. In 2008, Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the commonwealth since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The state was hard fought until the end in 2012, and Mitt Romney finished with 47 percent – apropos for that cycle. But Trump garnered just 44 percent in 2016 – the lowest vote share for any GOP nominee since Tom Dewey in 1948. -- The center of political gravity continues shifting more towards Northern Virginia as the D.C. suburbs grow. This region has become more Democratic with an influx of immigrants, federal employees and highly-educated technology workers. Democrats used to do very well in coal country, meanwhile, but the southwestern region of the state has drifted out of reach and Trump ran up huge margins there. Check out this visualization of how rural parts of the state have become redder over the past few decades, even as the state became bluer because of dense pockets of Democratic support: -- What a difference a decade makes: To atone for his apostasies, one of Perriello’s very first campaign stops after launching his campaign was at a Falls Church abortion clinic. Though NARAL backed his opponent, he has a 100 percent score based on his answers to the group’s questionnaire. Perriello also now promises free community college, paid family leave and universal pre-kindergarten. Northam promises a ban on assault weapons, a free associate’s degree in exchange for a year of public service and to make preschool more affordable for low-income families. On almost every policy issue, the candidates are simpatico. Both support a $15-an-hour minimum wage and came out for marijuana  decriminalization. They’ve often wound up trying to out-do one another on who can be the most rhetorically anti-Trump. Northam, for instance, calls Trump a “narcissistic maniac” in his stump speech and his TV ads. Each has also emphasized stylistic and biographic differences. Northam, 57, was a pediatric neurologist who spent eight years in the Army – treating casualties in Desert Storm. Perriello, 42, earned his undergrad and law degrees from Yale and helped prosecute war crimes in Sierra Leone before going to Congress. After he lost, he led the advocacy arm of the liberal Center for American Progress. Then Obama appointed him as a State Department envoy. -- Perriello, perceived by insiders as the underdog, won the backing of the professional left: Sanders and Elizabeth Warren endorsed him, George Soros gave half a million bucks and out-of-state environmentalists got on board when he opposed two gas pipelines. -- Northam, who speaks with a rural Southern drawl, scored every establishment endorsement that would traditionally matter in a statewide primary: the governor, both senators, every Democrat in the state legislature and three of the four Democratic congressmen in the delegation. (The fourth is neutral.) He’s also got the pro-choice groups and the teachers unions. -- Politicians are going to pander. That’s what politicians do. But even if Perriello and Northam are putting their fingers in the wind, all these explicit expressions of liberalism show which way they think the wind is blowing in Virginia. Until very recently, serious Democrats who wanted to win statewide – even ones looking to get a leg up in competitive primaries – were hyper-cautious when answering questions about hot-buttons like guns, abortion, gay rights and drugs. They certainly didn’t bring those issues up – unless it was to break with the Democratic Party as a way of signaling cultural conservatism. In 2013, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) foreshadowed the dynamic in this year’s primary by talking up his support for reproductive rights  and gun control. He didn’t even have a challenger from his left, but he was trying to gin up the base and mobilize unmarried women who don’t typically vote in off-year elections. It worked. This was a sea change from 2001, when Mark Warner won the governorship by focusing on red corners of the state as much as the D.C. ‘burbs. He ran as a “radical centrist,” sponsored a NASCAR team, used bluegrass music for his campaign theme song and expressed support for Bush in commercials that ran after Sept. 11. (Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will be back in the spotlight again today as he questions Attorney General Jeff Sessions.) -- The winner of today’s Democratic primary will enter the general election as the frontrunner against likely Republican nominee Ed Gillespie. The former Washington lobbyist and RNC chairman, who came within a few thousand votes of toppling Warner in 2014, is the heavy favorite against Corey Stewart, who chaired Trump’s campaign in Virginia last year, and state Sen. Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach. (Read my March Big Idea about the GOP primary here.) -- Turnout is expected to be low in both primaries, which works in Northam’s favor since he’s the favorite of party regulars. -- Canvassers for both Democrats lament that the electorate seems largely tuned out, even people who have worked themselves up into an anti-Trump lather. A Washington Post poll last month found that just two in 10 Democratic and Republican-leaning voters were paying “very close” attention to this race. (Laura Vozzella and Fenit Nirappil explored this dynamic in Sunday’s paper.) -- African Americans could make up as much as a quarter of the Democratic electorate today. Perriello has been running an ad with a clip of Obama offering support for his 2010 reelection, but despite his best efforts he couldn’t get the former president to endorse him. To ensure Obama didn’t come off the sidelines, Jonathan Martin reported in the Times last week, Northam telephoned Eric Holder to assure the former Attorney General that he’d been an early supporter and to request that he pass along the message. While about 30 former Obama aides have publicly offered support for Perriello, endorsements from staffers don’t move votes. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- The Golden State Warriors found redemption, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 129-120 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals and winning their second championship in three years. Tim Bontemps reports: “Last July, five NBA all-stars met in a room in The Hamptons on Long Island. Four of them — Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala — sat on one side of the table, fresh off an epic collapse from a 3-1 lead against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. On the other side sat Kevin Durant … So it was fitting Monday night, when the Warriors found themselves in the exact same position — holding a 3-1 lead over these same Cavaliers, trying to close out the NBA Finals on their home court here at Oracle Arena — that Warriors Coach Steve Kerr went repeatedly to the lineup he is often reluctant to use, no matter how unstoppable it is — the five all-stars playing together.” -- The Senate reached a bipartisan compromise to bring a Russian sanctions bill to the floor for a vote. Karoun Demirjian reports: “The measure, which will be attached to a bill to stiffen Iran sanctions that is under consideration, incorporates proposals to codify existing Russia sanctions, introduce punitive measures against Moscow in light of Russia’s aggressive activities in Ukraine, introduce measures addressing Syria and the realm of cyberhacking, and give Congress the power to review efforts by the administration to scale back sanctions against Russia before they can go through ... The measure filed Monday night directs sanctions toward Russia’s intelligence and defense apparatus, as well as parts of its energy, mining, railways and shipping economy. It also includes provisions to punish those engaged in corruption and human rights abuses.” GET SMART FAST:​​ THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Hackers allied with the Russian government have developed a cyberweapon that U.S. researchers say has the potential to be the “most disruptive yet” against essential American electrical systems. Ellen Nakashima reports: “The malware, which researchers have dubbed CrashOverride, is known to have disrupted only one energy system — in Ukraine in December. In that incident, the hackers briefly shut down one-fifth of the electric power generated in Kiev. But with modifications, it could be deployed against U.S. electric transmission and distribution systems to devastating effect, said Sergio Caltagirone, director of threat intelligence for Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that studied the malware … And Russian government hackers have already shown their interest in targeting U.S. energy and other utility systems. ‘It’s the culmination of over a decade of theory and attack scenarios,’ Caltagirone warned. ‘It’s a game changer.’” -- Russian attempts to hack state voting systems ran far deeper than previously reported and could continue to affect future elections. Bloomberg’s Michael Riley and Jordan Robertson report: “In Illinois, investigators found evidence that cyber intruders tried to delete or alter voter data. The hackers accessed software designed to be used by poll workers on Election Day, and in at least one state accessed a campaign finance database … In all, the Russian hackers hit systems in a total of 39 states ... The new details … show the scope of alleged hacking that federal investigators are scrutinizing as they look into whether Trump campaign officials may have colluded in the efforts. But they also paint a worrisome picture for future elections: The newest portrayal of potentially deep vulnerabilities in the U.S.’s patchwork of voting technologies comes less than a week after former FBI Director James Comey warned Congress that Moscow isn’t done meddling.” -- British authorities may be covering up the Russian political assassination of Alexander Perepilichnyy. From a Buzzfeed News investigation with five bylines: “The British government is suppressing explosive intelligence that Alexander Perepilichnyy, a financier who exposed a vast financial crime by Russian government officials, was likely assassinated on the direct orders of Vladimir Putin. Perepilichnyy, who faced repeated threats after fleeing to Britain, was found dead outside his home in Surrey after returning from a mysterious trip to Paris in 2012. Despite an expert detecting signs of a fatal plant poison in his stomach, the British police have insisted there was no evidence of foul play.

The Health 202: Conservative groups balk at possibility of retaining Obamacare taxes,"THE PROGNOSIS Today, 45 of the top conservative activist groups will send a letter to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) asking that he ensure all the Affordable Care Act's taxes are repealed in a Republican health-care bill. “Recent media reports suggest that the Senate may be wavering on repeal of these taxes,” write Americans for Tax Reform, Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and others. “This would be a mistake.” Industry and outside groups are also pouring on the pressure to eliminate the taxes permanently. More than 50 employer groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Benefits Council, wrote to Senate leaders on Friday asking them to repeal the law’s so-called “Cadillac tax” on high-cost health plans and its taxes on fully-insured health plans, branded pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Here's what's setting off alarm bells among the grass roots: my colleagues Kelsey Snell and Sean Sullivan reported last week that Senate Republicans were indeed considering the possibility of retaining some of the ACA's taxes in order to pay for a more expensive health-care legislation that would provide more Americans with insurance for longer. But such a move would likely -- as the above letter suggests -- open a chasm with the outside groups that have successfully driven a wedge among Republicans in Congress over the past several years, and could jeopardize passage of an Obamacare overhaul. The problem is the tension between moderates and conservatives over how quickly to phase out the ACA's Medicaid expansion and how generous to make its subsidies. A shorter phaseout period and fewer subsidies means more people would lose insurance but it would cost less; a longer fade-out and more subsidies means fewer people would be in danger of losing coverage but the more expensive the measure would be. The House bill would end extra federal payments in 2020 for the population that got coverage through ACA's Medicaid expansion. McConnell is said to be open to a longer, three-year delay, according to Hill aides, while some moderates including Sens. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Dean Heller (R-Nev.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.V.) have pushed for a longer delay until 2027. Enter Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), a former Club for Growth president who McConnell asked along with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) to help hammer out a compromise in the GOP conference on Medicaid. Toomey thinks there's a way to both do away with all of the ACA taxes and pay for phasing out Medicaid expansion more slowly: Extract even more savings from the regular Medicaid program, thereby freeing up money to pay for keeping expansion around for longer. Toomey -- along with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) -- would do this by pegging the program to the Consumer Price Index for Urban Consumers, the more commonly used CPI that also grows more slowly than the CPI medical index used in the House bill. The Obamacare overhaul passed by the House in May already extracts deep savings from Medicaid – about $880 billion over a decade. But from Toomey and Lee’s perspective, there’s more savings to be had. That’s because most of those savings don’t result from converting Medicaid to a per-capita payment system, a part of the House GOP health-care bill that most people blame for driving the overall Medicaid savings. Instead, the CBO has said the savings are expected to come chiefly from the 17 percent fewer people who are anticipated to enroll in the program by 2026. That reality leaves room for more actual cuts to Medicaid in the eyes of some conservatives. You could argue such a solution could be a bargain for both sides. Conservatives lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) get to tell constituents they off-roaded hated Obamacare taxes and enacted even deeper cuts to a big, government program. Moderates like Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) could argue they aren't unfairly ripping coverage away from a population that just received it. Two top conservative leaders – Heritage President Mike Needham and Club for Growth President David McIntosh – wrote in favor of the idea last week. “The only way to put Medicaid on a truly sustainable budget is to ensure it cannot grow faster than the economy as a whole,” they wrote in The Hill. Except for one big problem: Moderates generally dislike the idea of cutting parts of Medicaid to pay for other parts of Medicaid. Portman is opposed to the idea, a spokesman said. Heller said last week that he would oppose a bill tying Medicaid to a slower growth rate than under the House bill. “I just don’t want to do worse than what the House did. And there’s a push to bring it below the House, so that’s an issue,” Heller told Roll Call. Furthermore, Medicaid expansion and Medicaid cuts are just a piece of the current health-care negotiations in the Senate. Senators are also trying to sort out whether to make insurance subsidies more generous, how much of the law’s insurer regulations to repeal and how to ensure taxpayer dollars don’t go to plans that cover abortions. Some of this should come into clearer focus today as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is expected to brief his conference at their weekly luncheon on Capitol Hill on the various options available to them. McConnell has said he would like to see a vote on a health-care package before lawmakers leave for their July 4 recess, but some note that deadline could slip. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 3 GOP leader, told Politico's Burgess Everett yesterday that the timeline is “an aspiration” but not a hard deadline. At today's lunches, McConnell wants to explain the costs and benefits of various elements in a possible GOP measure -- such as how the speed of the Medicaid phaseout or the generosity of insurance subsidies would affect the bill's overall price tag and how many people might lose insurance coverage under various scenarios. The goal is to tentatively agree on something in the next few days, Hill aides say, so a final bill can be drafted and shipped off to the Congressional Budget Committee for a score -- which could take two to three weeks. If Senate Republicans have any hopes of forging consensus, their luncheon will need to look more like a trading floor than a boxing ring. The only pathway to the 50 votes needed for passage involves some hard bargaining between moderates and conservatives. All of these differences need to be hashed out – and consensus reached – before they can move seriously ahead on an Obamacare overhaul. How quickly things move (or don't move) this week on Capitol Hill could be a strong indicator of whether Senate Republicans will ultimately be able to succeed. AHH: President Trump will meet today with 13 Republicans senators to discuss their efforts to remake big parts of Obamacare, White House officials have confirmed to The Health 202. The list of attendees notably includes the two moderates whose votes are considered hardest-to-get -- Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- and two conservatives -- Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah -- who could also refuse to support the bill if they think it retains too much of Obamacare. --Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and John Barrasso of Wyoming, both in leadership, are also on the invite list, as are Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Joni Ernst of Iowa and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah.

The Health 202: Meet Obamacare's biggest Twitter defender,"THE PROGNOSIS If you could slay the GOP health-care bill with words, Andy Slavitt would have done it by now. Until four months ago, Slavitt oversaw Obamacare for Obama. Since then, he’s been carving out a niche as a top, vocal critic of Republicans and their one-sided effort to overturn big parts of the Affordable Care Act. Slavitt was always refreshingly talkative, even during his two years as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that also runs most of the ACA's biggest components. And now that he's out from under agency shackles, Slavitt prides himself on being candid -- and highly snarky, at times. His Twitter feed has become a must-read for those following the Republican effort to repeal and replace some of the ACA. Here are some choice examples: Over the weekend, Slavitt appeared to criticize the news website Axios, for ​​​​describing Pence's health-care promises as creating trouble"" for the Senate -- instead of calling them outright falsehoods: We're still referring to bold-faced lies as ""trouble."" https://t.co/B1SX7Iggox A few weeks ago"
Planned Parenthood’s claim about birth control access for ‘99 percent of sexually active women’,"“99% of sexually active women have used birth control in their lifetime. Our lawmakers must hear from us. We won’t allow an extreme anti-woman agenda to undermine birth control access.” — Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a tweet, June 2, 2017 “99% of sexually active women have used birth control in their lifetime. It’s not optional. A leaked memo shows the Trump admin wants to let your employer come in between you & no-copay birth control.” — Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a tweet, May 31, 2017 These tweets and the graphic caught our attention, as we’ve looked into this figure in the past and found it to lack context. A leaked memo shows the Trump admin wants to let your employer come in between you & no-copay birth control: https://t.co/6cLiv6TzCg pic.twitter.com/YWt4H6LB6l — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) May 31, 2017  Our lawmakers must hear from us. We won't allow an extreme anti-woman agenda to undermine birth control access: https://t.co/5Ko40C1quJ pic.twitter.com/EYExPBlbaS — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) June 2, 2017  According to a draft regulation obtained by Vox, the Trump administration wants to overhaul the birth control mandate under the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare. Reproductive rights groups opposed these proposed changes, and Planned Parenthood Action Fund used this statistic in its tweets about the draft regulation. It’s worth noting that Planned Parenthood’s wording for this statistic includes the caveat “sexually active,” which other organizations don’t always do. Still, it needs more context, especially when juxtaposed against Obamacare’s birth control mandate. Under the ACA, employers are required to offer insurance coverage for contraceptive methods and counseling for all women. These contraceptive methods include: barrier methods (diaphragms, sponges), hormonal methods (birth control pills, vaginal rings), implanted devices (such as intrauterine devices, or IUDs), emergency contraception and sterilization. In May, President Trump signed an executive order “promoting free speech and religious liberty,” directing the executive branch to “vigorously enforce” religious freedom protections. Among other things, the order directed Cabinet secretaries to “consider issuing amended regulations” consistent with current federal law for groups that have religious objections to providing their employees insurance coverage for contraceptive care. Currently, certain religious employers are exempt from this mandate, including churches, houses of worship and some nonprofit religious organizations, such as religiously affiliated hospitals. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, the Supreme Court ruled that “closely held,” for-profit corporations with religious owners are also exempt. The draft regulation aims to expand exemptions to all for-profit entities, allowing them to decline providing free contraceptive coverage based on religious or moral grounds. With that in mind, let’s look at the 99 percent statistic. The statistic comes from a February 2013 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This study looked at contraceptive methods among women from 1982 to 2010. So the data predate Obamacare, which was enacted in 2013. The study is based on interviews with a national representative sample of 12,279 women in 2006 to 2010 from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Researchers found 88.2 percent of women age 15 to 44 had used contraception. Some women used contraceptive hormones for health benefits unrelated to pregnancy, whether or not they have had intercourse. Of the women they interviewed, age 15 to 44, 86.6 percent had had vaginal intercourse. These women were counted as “sexually experienced.” Among this population, 99 percent had used one contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime. The necessary context is that “contraception” refers to any method that women and men use to prevent a pregnancy, under the CDC definition. It includes female and male sterilization, birth control pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs), emergency contraception, condoms, withdrawal method and periodic abstinence (also known as the rhythm method). In 2006-2010, among women age 15 to 44 who have ever had sexual intercourse, 81.9 percent had ever taken the pill; 93.4 percent had ever used a condom; 59.6 percent had used withdrawal method; and 18.1 percent had used the rhythm method. So a woman having sex regularly and receiving free coverage for her IUD or birth control pills through her employer is counted the same as a woman who had sex only once and used the withdrawal method or used a condom. When advocates use this statistic, they’re using the term “birth control” as synonymous as “contraception,” and referring to any method used to prevent pregnancy, regardless of whether it is something that is covered under Obamacare. That’s not always made clear. It can create a misleading picture, as if 99 percent of sexually active women would be affected by the Trump regulation to overhaul the Obamacare birth control mandate. Of course, condoms, withdrawal and rhythm method are not covered under Obamacare. Planned Parenthood said the organization is not using the graphic to illustrate what’s at risk under the specific draft regulation, but to show that efforts to prevent pregnancy is a ubiquitous experience among sexually active women, and that the Trump administration “seems to be acting with a complete disregard for” this shared experience. Spokeswoman Erica Sackin also noted that given the access to contraceptive coverage under Obamacare, the primary method of contraception could have changed since the CDC study. The CDC study, “along with a few that showed how women have struggled to afford the cost of birth control, helped illustrate why the increased access under the ACA (and that’s at risk with the Trump rule) is just so important,” Sackin said. “Women won’t stop trying to prevent pregnancy if this rule goes into effect, they’ll just be less able to have the full range of options to do so. We would argue that the Trump administration’s new rule is fairly cruel in its disregard for what women want, need, or the realities of how they live their lives.” In the past, we’ve found issues where reproductive rights advocates used CDC research to make fishy claims about the use of birth control methods. Each time, we’ve awarded Two Pinocchios (here, here, here), because the same underlying issues arise: The statistic is used to refer to contraception coverage under Obamacare, yet the research includes methods of family planning. The same issue exists here. Planned Parenthood used the statistic that “99% of sexually active women have used birth control in their lifetime” in a debate over Obamacare coverage and proposed regulations under the Trump administration that would roll back the free contraception. Yet the study, again, includes methods of natural family planning or condom use, neither of which is included in contraceptive coverage. Planned Parenthood says it was using this statistic to illustrate the ubiquity of family planning among sexually active women; we find this point needs to be made extra clear in the group’s tweets.

Republicans have even bigger problems than Trump,"President Trump’s potential impeachment isn’t even Republicans’ worst problem. Sure, they look foolish and craven trying to play defense for a president whose bullying tactics may finally do him in and whose habitual dishonesty leaves him exposed to the detailed denunciation of former FBI director James B. Comey. Yes, it’s true — Republicans’ failure to take action against his attorney general, who apparently concealed three meetings with the Russians from the Senate Judiciary Committee and omitted them from his security clearance application, demonstrates their fecklessness. And, certainly, their utter lack of concern for arguably daily violations of the emoluments clauses belies their claim to be “constitutional conservatives.” But they actually have even bigger problems with the electorate. The Quinnipiac poll last week told us: American voters disapprove 62 – 17 percent of the Republican health care plan, compared to a 57 – 20 percent disapproval in a May 25 Quinnipiac University poll. . . . Republicans approve of the health care plan 42 – 25 percent, as every other listed party, gender, education, age or racial group disapproves by wide margins.  Voters oppose 65 – 30 percent decreasing federal funding for Medicaid. Republicans support a Medicaid cut 49 – 39 percent, while every other listed group opposes the cut by wide margins.  Voters disapprove 66 – 28 percent of the way Trump is handling health care. In other words, by a tepid plurality Republicans approve of the Republicans’ signature issue, health-care reform, but the vast majority of Americans hate it. Even worse for their electoral prospects, Republicans in Congress are highly unlikely to deliver on health-care reform, thereby alienating their base. They end up with a disappointed base and a majority of engaged, angry voters. It’s a deadly combination in a midterm election, especially given the historic pattern in which the party that holds the White House loses seats in the first midterm. Sure enough, Quinnipiac shows a huge deficit for Republicans in generic congressional polling: “American voters say 51 – 39 percent that they would like to see the Democratic Party win control of the House of Representatives. Independent voters are divided as 43 percent want Republican control and 42 percent want Democratic control. By a similar 52 – 39 percent, voters would like to see Democrats win control of the U.S. Senate. Again, independent voters are divided, with 42 percent for Republicans and 43 percent for Democrats.” Voters aren’t thrilled with the job Democrats are going but they really don’t like what the Republicans are up to: “American voters disapprove 73 – 19 percent of the job Republicans in Congress are doing and disapprove 63 – 28 percent of the job Democrats in Congress are doing.” An early indicator of Republican troubles will come a week from Tuesday in the special election in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District. A new poll last week from the Atlanta Journal Constitution should frighten Republicans. “Democrat Jon Ossoff has a 7-point edge over Republican Karen Handel in the nationally watched race to represent Georgia’s 6th Congressional District.” Ossoff leads 51 to 44 in a district Tom Price won by 23 points in 2016. Handel’s debate performance and campaign more broadly have not endeared her to voters. Ossoff has a favorable rating of 52 percent, Handel just 42 percent. He is holding his base and picking up more cross-over voters than she is. (“He’s capturing about 13 percent of Republican voters and 50 percent of independents — a crucial voting bloc that leans to the right. It shows almost no crossover on the flip side; only 3 percent of Democrats say they’re backing Handel.”) Interestingly, Trump is slumping in the district, but Handel, isn’t as damaged by her association with him as one might expect. The poll shows: Only about one-third of voters in the district approve of him, and 1 in 4 Republicans give him an unfavorable review. Eleven percent of his supporters in November said they have a dim opinion of him. Still, a plurality of voters — 45 percent — said their support or opposition to the president didn’t play a role in their vote for Congress. About 40 percent of voters said their vote aimed to send a message that they opposed Trump — including more than three-quarters of Democrats. The big problem for Handel seems to be the Republicans’ American Health Care Act. In the district, 81 percent of voters say it’s the most important issue, and it is really unpopular. (“Just one-quarter of voters said they approve of the House’s health care plan, and the poll shows tepid support even among Republicans.”) In sum, in a district that is rated as 9.5+ Republican, a traditional suburban stronghold for Republicans, a Republican forced to defend the AHCA may lose by a significant margin. There are a considerable number of districts far less Republican than the GA-6 which, if the GA-6 goes Democratic, become optimal pick-up seats for Democrats. Trump’s low approvals and appalling behavior may discourage Republicans and energize Democrats. What may seal the GOP’s fate, however, is a health-care bill that voters detest.

The Republicans have another health care idea. Shocking!,
Happy Hour Roundup,"* Via Clare Foran, you’ll be shocked to hear that many Republicans are not in the least bit troubled by what they “learned” from the release of James Comey’s written testimony to Congress today: High-ranking Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate Intelligence Committee, two congressional panels investigating potential links between Russia and Trump campaign associates, had sharply divergent responses to the testimony. “Former FBI Director Comey’s written testimony confirms a host of troubling allegations concerning the President’s conduct,” Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. In contrast, Senator Richard Burr, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, reportedly reacted to the testimony by saying “I don’t think from what I’ve read there’s anything of wrongdoing,” according to The Guardian’s Lauren Gambino. Burr reportedly added: “I don’t think it’s wrong to ask for loyalty from anybody inside the administration.”… Some congressional Republicans downplayed the suggestion of impropriety and instead focused attention on Comey’s testimony that he “offered” an “assurance” to the president during a January briefing that “we did not have an open counter-intelligence case on him,” a notably qualified statement that would not preclude any other kind of investigation, or the opening of such an investigation in the future. “Former FBI Director Comey’s statement proves what we have already known: President Trump is not under investigation,” Republican Representative Jeff Duncan tweeted. “Reality check: Comey testimony — he told @POTUS Trump he was not being investigated; POTUS did not ask him to stop Russia investigation,” Republican Representative Peter King wrote on Twitter. That reaction echoed the response from the Republican National Committee. “President Trump was right,” RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. “Director Comey’s statement reconfirmed what the president has been saying all along — he was never under investigation.” Just to be clear on the facts here, even if Comey did tell Trump several times earlier this spring that he wasn’t personally under investigation, this does not mean that the conversations themselves that took place between Comey and Trump are not currently being examined as possible obstruction of justice. I’m not saying they are or aren’t; merely that we do not know either way. Regardless, Comey’s testimony details that Trump personally demanded Comey’s loyalty, at a time when the FBI was investigating whether his campaign colluded with a foreign power’s effort to sabotage our election. It unequivocally declares that Trump prodded him to close down the FBI probe into his former national security adviser’s Russia ties. All this substantially advances our understanding of how Trump tried to mold his relationship with his own FBI director — in part during a conversation about whether Comey was going to stay in the job — into what Comey called a “patronage relationship.” As we know from Trump’s own admission on national television, he subsequently fired Comey over his handling of the Russia probe, which is to say, because Comey continued pursuing the investigation into potential Trump-Russia campaign collusion rather than demonstrate the “loyalty” that Comey says Trump demanded of him. These revelations, which have been attested to on the record by Comey for the first time, have enormously troubling implications for Trump’s views of the proper relationship between the office of the president and law enforcement, whether or not they end up amounting to obstruction of justice. As is the case with so many other things Trump has done, we’re again seeing on display a deep rot of bad faith on Trump’s part towards the responsibilities of the office — a profound contempt for our processes and institutions — with no discernible bottom. And Republicans should be pressed to respond to the substance of the allegations. — gs * Benjamin Wittes has a terrific take on the granular and big picture meaning of James Comey’s written testimony released today. A taste: “It is the most shocking single document compiled about the official conduct of the public duties of any President since the release of the Watergate tapes.” * Max Ehrenfreund reports that Sam Brownback’s disastrous experiment in Republican economics is finally coming to an end: Republicans in Kansas broke ranks with the state’s conservative governor Tuesday night, voting to raise tax rates and put an end to a series of cuts. The GOP revolt is a defeat for Gov. Sam Brownback, who overhauled the state’s tax system beginning in 2012, part of what called a “real-live experiment” in conservative governance. Yet the economic boom Brownback promised has not materialized, leaving the state government perennially short on money and forced to reduce basic services. Kansas’s legislature is overwhelmingly Republican, but moderate GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to override Brownback’s veto of the bill to increase taxes. Eighteen of the state’s 31 GOP senators and 49 of the 85 Republican members of the House voted against the governor. Will this convince other Republicans that perhaps cutting taxes does not bring economic nirvana for all? No, it will not. * Louis Nelson reports that Trump gave an inspiring speech about infrastructure today in Ohio: With a barge full of what the president identified as West Virginia coal behind him, Trump touted the reduced regulations that he said would benefit not just the coal industry, but also the steel industry and other blue collar industries he promised to champion throughout his 2016 campaign, transition and into his presidency. Slow repair work on canals and locks on inland waterways cannot be tolerated, he said, because of how valuable those routes are for the U.S. economy. He also pledged, as he has in the past, to crack down on foreign governments that he has accused of taking advantage of the U.S., and especially the U.S. steel industry, in international trade. And he began the speech, of course, by talking about what a great victory he had in Ohio. If a hurricane wiped out the entire state of Florida, the first thing he’d say would be, “Do you know what a great victory I had in Florida? Nobody thought I could do it.” * The new Quinnipiac poll is full of terrible news for Trump. His approval is down to 34 percent, 60 percent say he did something unethical or illegal with regard to Russia, and 62 percent disapprove of his decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.  * Jose DelReal reports on a new study showing that low-income Americans in rural areas — i.e., Trump’s base — would be hit particularly hard by Trumpcare’s destruction of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Oops? * Philip Klein, Robert King, and Kimberly Leonard explain why the Senate GOP health care bill could be on the verge of sparking a conservative rebellion. * Matt Zapotosky has lots of details about Christopher Wray, who was Chris Christie’s lawyer during the Bridgegate scandal, and now has been nominated by Trump to be the new FBI director. I wonder what kind of loyalty pledge Trump demanded from Wray? * Matt Shuham notes that for the second day in a row, Sean Spicer can’t say whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions still has Trump’s confidence. * At The Week, I explained why every Democrat should run for president. * A quick housekeeping note: Thursday’s Morning Plum will be posted a bit late so it can reflect some of Comey’s testimony to Congress tomorrow. * And Amanda Marcotte examines the economic damage that the Republican war on contraception could do.

Make no mistake. Republicans can still succeed in destroying Obamacare.,"THE MORNING PLUM: In recent days, a procession of GOP senators has paraded forth and declared in somber tones that the effort to repeal and replace Obamacare may be failing. Mitch McConnell, the GOP Senate leader from Kentucky, recently said he didn’t see a path yet. Or, as GOP Sen. Lindsey O. Graham put it: “I just don’t think we can put it together among ourselves.” But some Democratic Senate aides don’t buy it. With a Senate vote now expected this month, they are bracing for several scenarios in which Republicans produce surprise tactics at the last minute that enable them to pass something. This would then get them through to the next stage — negotiations between the House and Senate — which would have the virtue of increasing the pressure on reluctant holdouts to pass the final bill, pulling the trigger and destroying the Affordable Care Act for good. One such scenario involves writing a bill that defers dealing with some of the tough details just to get through to conference committee, where the Senate and House bills would be reconciled, a Democratic aide tells me. In this rendering, the aide says, McConnell “puts together something very limited to go to conference, putting off hard decisions until the final bill is written with the White House at the table.” Right now, Republicans face several obstacles. One is that some senators from states that have expanded Medicaid — there are 20 GOP senators from such states — are balking at the Medicaid cuts in the House bill. The measure that passed the House would cut more than $800 billion from Medicaid and restructure the program to transfer more control to the states (which means more cuts and more draconian conditions, and fewer covered) and do away with the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Senate Republicans are mulling a version that would roll back the Medicaid expansion a bit more slowly. This would create “a smoother glide path,” claims Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), in a bit of very smooth rhetoric that glides over the likelihood that the Senate version will still cut Medicaid for untold numbers of poor people. Senate Republicans are also mulling subsidies that are somewhat more generous than the House bill (which overall would leave 23 million additional people uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office). And Axios reports that the Senate version might also soften the House bill by allowing states to waive the requirement that insurers cover “essential health benefits” while not allowing them to waive the prohibition on jacking up premiums for people with preexisting conditions, a provision in the House bill. But we simply don’t know what the Senate bill will look like just yet. Democratic aides are preparing for several tactics that Senate Republicans could employ to get moderates to support the bill. One is to create a “placeholder” or “shell” bill that does not work out too many details of the Medicaid cuts, allowing moderates to say they will protect Medicaid in conference negotiations, a senior Democratic aide tells me. “If they try this route, Democrats will absolutely hold every single Republican senator accountable for that vote,” the aide says. “Republicans will be voting to dismantle our health-care system, and we’ll make sure people understand that.” “Republicans are dead-set on getting to 50 votes so they can jam some version of Trumpcare through the Senate,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) told me in an emailed statement. “So Democrats are looking at every possible scenario.” “Conceptually, they could leave unaddressed many of the details of the Medicaid cuts and work them out in conference,” Sarah Binder, a congressional expert at George Washington University, tells me, while cautioning that this is speculative. “They can deal with a vague Senate provision and a detailed House provision in conference.” A second scenario might be to insert language into the bill that obfuscates its true legislative impact. “They could put language in the bill that would make a political statement about, say, protecting those with preexisting conditions, even as the policy consequences would be different,” Binder says. Or, Binder suggests, it could include weaselly language on Medicaid cuts, such as: “Nothing in this bill should be construed to limit people entitled under the law to Medicaid coverage.” Binder explains: “The goal would be to insulate themselves from criticism that they are throwing people off Medicaid.” Of course, all of this is a reminder of a basic fact about this whole debate: The GOP’s massively regressive designs on the ACA — which at bottom constitute rolling back health coverage for untold millions of people to finance a huge tax cut for the rich — are deeply unpopular. By exposing those true designs to the public, this debate has succeeded in making Obamacare more popular and has underscored public opposition to rolling back the historic coverage expansion it has achieved, despite all its real flaws and need for improvement. And so, the CBO could do serious damage to any such GOP tactic by releasing a score of the Senate bill (when it is done) that shines a harsh light on what the bill would actually do. But Andy Slavitt, a former acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Obama administration, unleashed a tweet storm pointing out that, by keeping their bill behind closed doors for as long as possible, Republicans might limit the time that the public and the press have to absorb the CBO score’s implications before holding a vote. The bottom line is that whatever tactics Republicans use, if they can get something passed in the Senate, and get Senate and House Republicans into some form of negotiations designed to reconcile the two versions, the prospects of final success go up substantially. “The virtue of getting everyone into the same room is to get them out of the public eye, where they can come to a final agreement that then would be put to an up or down vote in both chambers,” Binder tells me, adding that at that point, the situation would be, “this is it: Are you for or against getting rid of Obamacare? This would increase the pressure on individual Republicans who are skittish.” To be sure, it’s possible that Republicans could still fail. But “success” is also a very real possibility. * COMEY FEARED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH TRUMP: The New York Times reports that then-FBI Director James B. Comey privately told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he didn’t want to be left alone with President Trump, after the president pushed him to end the Michael Flynn probe: His unwillingness to be alone with the president reflected how deeply Mr. Comey distrusted Mr. Trump, who Mr. Comey believed was trying to undermine the F.B.I.’s independence as it conducted a highly sensitive investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, the officials said. … Current and former law enforcement officials say Mr. Comey kept his interactions with Mr. Trump a secret in part because he was not sure whom at the Justice Department he could trust. That last bit previews how Comey will probably answer questions at tomorrow’s hearing about why he did not disclose his concerns earlier about Trump’s efforts to influence the probe. * COMEY WILL REFUTE TRUMP: CNN reports that at the hearing, Comey will refute Trump’s claim that Comey repeatedly told him he is not under investigation: One source said Comey is expected to explain to senators that those were much more nuanced conversations from which Trump concluded that he was not under investigation. Another source hinted that the President may have misunderstood the exact meaning of Comey’s words, especially regarding the FBI’s ongoing counterintelligence investigation. Trump would never botch or distort the nuances of an extremely consequential conversation involving his own culpability. Would he? * WHY TRUMP TURNED ON SESSIONS: It has been widely reported that Trump has grown furious with Sessions after he recused himself from the Russia probe. The Wall Street Journal adds a telling detail: He privately berated several top aides in the Oval Office after learning of Mr. Sessions’ recusal, and he has since then repeatedly expressed frustration about that decision, one White House official said. The president, who has denied any involvement with Russia’s alleged hacking of Democratic and other political organizations during the election, viewed Mr. Sessions’ decision as a sign of weakness, the official said. A sign of weakness! As I suggested yesterday, Trump, in true autocratic fashion, simply cannot brook any prioritization of process and law over loyalty to Trump. * GET READY FOR DAN COATS’S TESTIMONY TODAY: The Post reports that Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has told associates that Trump asked him to intervene to get Comey to back off the probe of Michael Flynn’s Russia ties: After the encounter, Coats discussed the conversation with other officials and decided that intervening with Comey as Trump had suggested would be inappropriate, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. Coats is set to testify today before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and he’ll surely be asked for more details on why he viewed Trump’s intervention as “inappropriate.” * LARGE MAJORITY GETS WHY TRUMP FIRED COMEY: A new Post-ABC News poll finds that 61 percent say Trump fired Comey to protect himself, rather than for the good of the country. Fifty-six percent say Trump is not cooperating with probes into Russian meddling. But: Large majorities of Republicans say Trump fired Comey for the good of the country (71 percent) and that he is cooperating with investigations into Russia’s election influence (77 percent). Also: 55 percent have low trust in what Comey is saying about all this, but an even higher 72 percent distrust what Trump is saying, so Comey may have the credibility edge tomorrow. * DEMOCRATIC PARTY ID ADVANTAGE EXPANDS: Gallup finds the Democratic advantage in party identification over Republicans has grown, with 45 percent self-identifying as Dems or Dem-leaners, while 38 percent self-identify as Republicans or GOP-leaners: The growing Democratic advantage in recent months is mostly attributable to a decline in Republican affiliation rather than an increase in Democratic affiliation. Since November, the percentage of Republicans and Republican leaners has fallen four percentage points, while there has been a one-point rise in Democratic identification or leaning. Gallup adds that Trump’s unpopularity may be a key factor in the drop in people self-identifying as Republicans, and that this could boost Dem chances in 2018. * AND THE QUOTE OF THE DAY, KINSLEY-GAFFE EDITION: At last night’s debate in the special election for a House seat in the Atlanta suburbs, GOP candidate Karen Handel answered a question about the minimum wage this way: “This is an example of a fundamental difference between a liberal and a conservative. I do not support a livable wage.” A Kinsley Gaffe, for you young ‘uns out there, refers to Michael Kinsley’s well-known formulation that a gaffe is when a politician tells “some obvious truth he isn’t supposed to say.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

"The Daily 202: Ohio is hurting because of Obamacare’s uncertain future, but Trumpcare could make matters worse","With Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: COLUMBUS, Ohio—The White House has tacked on a last-minute addition to Donald Trump’s Ohio itinerary. After landing in Cincinnati this afternoon to talk about infrastructure, the president’s official schedule says he will meet “with Obamacare victims” on Air Force One. His quick trip comes one day after Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield announced that it is pulling out of the federal exchange in Ohio, which means that there will be no insurer offering coverage in at least 20 of this state's 88 counties. The news instantly became a political hot potato, offering an early test of whether Trump will be able to successfully deflect responsibility for a system whose collapse is being hastened by his decisions. White House press secretary Sean Spicer seized on the Anthem announcement yesterday afternoon as proof that the Affordable Care Act has failed, announcing at the top of his briefing that it will leave “19,000 Ohioans without any options.” (The state said the move actually impacts 10,500 consumers, and policy experts were puzzled by how Sean came up with his inflated number.) Regardless of how many are hurt, though, the company blamed the Trump administration – citing “the lack of certainty” over whether the federal government will continue to fund cost-sharing subsidies. “Planning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to the shrinking individual market as well as continual changes in federal operations, rules and guidance,” the insurer said in a statement. -- Since Trump took office, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has been warning that the insurance markets are “slipping into crisis.” The Republican wrote in February that his “first priority should be to restore stability” in the exchanges to make sure companies keep offering plans. “They can’t make any money. When they make money, they’re usually there,” Kasich told me recently during a half-hour interview in his office at the state capitol. -- But there is a powerful faction inside the White House, led by the president himself, that is rooting for the American health care system to collapse. The executive branch’s strategy is to persuade the public that the ACA’s meltdown is inevitable and thereby prod recalcitrant Republicans in the legislative branch to get on board with an unpopular replacement plan. As Trump told The Post in March: “The best thing politically is to let Obamacare explode.” The administration has taken many steps, big and small, to make the exchanges less stable and discourage companies from offering plans. One of Trump’s first executive orders directed agencies to ease regulatory burdens created by the ACA, which weakened some of the system’s foundations. The Internal Revenue Service then announced it would not enforce the individual mandate. Many healthy young people only participate in the system, which keeps premiums lower for everyone else, because they don’t want to pay the fine. Then Trump’s team curtailed consumer outreach that had already been planned during the final days of the 2017 enrollment period. All of this has created a weird dynamic in which the very agency tasked with administering a law seems to be publicly cheerleading for its demise. The Department of Health and Human Services blasts out a steady stream of press releases about rising premiums and other weaknesses in the system, which adds to the uncertainty and the lack of confidence. -- The increasing fragility of the marketplaces has created a dilemma for the president's top advisers. Juliet Eilperin and Abby Phillip have a richly reported piece that posted this morning on a behind-the-scenes battle that’s playing out inside the administration: “The issue is whether to take some steps to allay the concerns of skittish insurers that are either hiking up rates or pulling out altogether, or let things deteriorate even further - even at the risk of being blamed. … (Vice President Mike) Pence and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney have argued against intervention, while Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price backs providing some federal support if a conservative health-care bill fails to pass this summer. For the moment, the administration has defaulted to a position of doing little to try to soothe the health insurance industry even as many insurers warn that federal actions - or inaction - could aggravate the situation.” -- The biggest source of industry anxiety is the issue of cost-sharing subsidies that Anthem cited in its Ohio announcement. It’s still up in the air whether the Trump administration will continue fronting the money that helps 7 million Americans with ACA plans afford deductible and co-pays. Congressional Republicans argue that the Obama administration is responsible for the mess because it paid out the subsidies unilaterally after the Republican-controlled House refused to appropriate them. Whether the previous president overreached is subject to ongoing litigation. -- But it is differences over Medicaid funding formulas, probably more than any other issue, that threaten to torpedo the prospects of a bill passing the Senate. And the Buckeye State, a linchpin of the president’s Rust Belt electoral majority, is disproportionately impacted by whatever happens. About 700,000 low-income Ohioans gained insurance because Kasich expanded Medicaid under Obamacare. Another 200,000 picked up coverage in the exchanges because of the subsidies, Kasich’s staff estimates. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has  estimated that the bill which passed the House would leave 23 million more Americans uninsured by 2026 than under current law. The American Health Care Act, which Trump has  embraced and celebrated, would also cut Medicaid spending by $834 billion over the next decade. -- Among Republicans, Kasich has been one of the most outspoken critics of the AHCA – which has become known as Trumpcare. He warns in dire terms of the human cost if it became law. “It’s understandable that the burden from the federal government over time can be reduced, but you can’t do it over night,” the governor said in our interview. “The high-risk pools are something that’s been tried, but they went out of business because of the cost. We’re not really interested.” Kasich demurred when asked about the econometric analysis that shows Trump’s core supporters would be among those most harmed by the House bill. He instead recounted a recent conversation with a constituent who wondered, “Am I going to lose my health insurance?” “These are not people who live on Mars. These are people who live next door,” the governor said. “I don’t care about the politics. I care about these folks.” “If the politics mattered to me, then I guess I would have gone to the Republican convention and endorsed Trump. But I don’t operate that way,” he added. “Most people, if you sit down and talk to them and say, ‘Should there be coverage for these people?’, I think people say yes. I don’t think there’s that many pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps types. But there’s some. It would be tragic to see folks who now have something to look forward to, where there’s light at the end of the tunnel, where they have some hope now, if all of a sudden they don’t have it anymore.” -- Ohio has been particularly hard hit by the opioid epidemic, and the state spends almost $1 billion a year directly dealing with the scourge. Of that amount, Kasich’s team calculates, about $650 million comes through benefits of the Medicaid program. Some of that cash was there traditionally, they say, but the bulk of it comes as a result of the ACA. The governor is blunt: “When people understand that a lot of this, particularly with expansion, goes to help people who are mentally-ill and drug-addicted, even if they philosophically don’t like it, they have to ask themselves: How would we fill the gap if all of a sudden we didn’t have it?!” “Nobody has fought more for fiscal responsibility and balancing the federal budget than I have, anywhere in the country,” Kasich continued. “So I’m mindful of costs, but I’m also mindful of priorities … (Ronald) Reagan expanded Medicaid five times or something. … “You want people to be healthy. You want people to feel like they have a shot. To me, that is a very conservative position.” -- During a closed-door lunch yesterday, all the GOP senators were presented with a PowerPoint slide deck that laid out the menu of options under consideration by their leadership about how to deal with major hang-ups, from Medicaid to tax credits. Lawmakers emerged more optimistic than they have been in recent weeks that something might actually pass, but there was still a general bearishness among the savviest members of the conference. Mitch McConnell, at an afternoon meeting with Trump at the White House, said the Senate will try to vote on a health bill before the July 4 recess. This is a very tight timeframe, but the idea is to move on if they cannot muster majority support for something by then. In a lucky break, Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee announced last night that the parliamentarian has ruled the bill which passed the House complies with the Byrd Rule. This is the first step in assuring that the chamber can use the reconciliation process to pass its bill with 51 votes, rather than 60. -- Rob Portman is in a tough spot. The Ohio senator, one of the best dealmakers Republicans have, has emerged as a key player in the ongoing negotiations. He’s said he could not have supported the House version of the bill because it phases out the Medicaid expansion too quickly, which he believes would hurt heroin/opioid addicts. “We can and must do better than ObamaCare, but we should do it in a way that protects the most vulnerable in our society,” Portman said in a statement reacting to the Anthem news. “I’m going to do everything I can to protect Ohio’s interests and ensure that our health care system works better for all Ohioans.” He told reporters after yesterday’s GOP lunch that the working version of the Senate bill, which has not been released publicly, “needs some work still” for him to get onboard. Unlike Portman, who won’t face voters again until 2022, Nevada’s Dean Heller is the most vulnerable Republican senator up for reelection next year. He too represents a purple state where a Republican governor expanded Medicaid under Obamacare, and he recognizes that voting for a bad bill may cost him his job. “The big print giveth. The small print taketh away,” he told reporters after the GOP lunch. “I'm waiting for the small print at this point.” -- The National Republican Senatorial Committee, meanwhile, seized on Anthem pulling out of Ohio to attack Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is also up for reelection next year. Spokesman Bob Salera asked in a press release: “Will Senator Brown abandon the failing infrastructure of Obamacare and to work with Senate Republicans on a heath care bill that will help Ohio? Or will be continue to blindly follow Washington liberals as Obamacare falls off a cliff?” Brown, for his part, attacked Republicans. “The dangerous game President Trump and Washington politicians are playing just caused 70,000 paying customers in Ohio to lose their insurance and it will continue raising prices for everyone else. It’s got to stop,” the senior senator said in a statement. “Instead of using working families as bargaining chips and driving up prices across the market, we need to work together to lower costs and make healthcare work better for everyone.” -- All the messaging and posturing reflects the degree to which health care is going to be a dominant issue in the 2018 midterms, whether a bill passes or not. This will be the fifth election cycle in a row when Obamacare is a top voter concern. -- Kasich says he prays that the Senate comes up with a much better bill than what passed the House. He said he’s talked with Portman, as well as Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) a couple of times. Cassidy, a physician, said last month that he will only vote for legislation if it passes “the Jimmy Kimmel test” after the late-night comedian revealed his newborn son has congenital heart disease. Cassidy explained the standard: “Would a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life?” Asked what message he’d like to send to the GOP senators he’s not in touch with, Kasich said: “If you don’t fund the program, there’s going to be a lot of people who lose coverage. It’s not any more complicated than that. The question is: Is that important to you or not?” Kasich has also spoken with governors across the ideological spectrum, from Michigan’s Rick Snyder (R) to Colorado’s John Hickenlooper (D), to come up with  some proposals he thinks could get consensus. Kasich was an outspoken conservative firebrand in the Washington of the 1990s, a top lieutenant in Newt Gingrich’s Revolution. He was a powerful chairman of the House Budget Committee when Speaker Paul Ryan was a 20-something legislative assistant who drank from kegs with Rich Lowry and waited tables at Tortilla Coast. After losing a big fight with the unions during his first year as governor in 2011, Kasich rebranded himself as a No Labels kind of guy. That helped him coast to reelection in 2014, but it made it hard for him to get lift-off in the crowded 2016 GOP primary field. He was preaching sober-minded pragmatism at a moment when the base of his party wanted smash-mouth confrontation. Now 65, with 18 months left in office, Kasich decries the corrosiveness of partisanship and says Republicans in D.C. need to give Democrats a seat at the negotiating table on health care. “When Obamacare passes with no Republicans, that doesn’t work,” he said. “Nothing that’s a major item is sustainable without bipartisan support. The best example of that is welfare reform. … There’s no magic. You work at it. You talk to people like they’re human beings.” “People come up to me and say, ‘If I hadn’t been able to get this insurance, I may not have survived,’” he added as we wrapped up our conversation. “I feel good about the fact that people say, ‘Somebody was looking out for me. Somebody cared about me. Somebody was concerned about me.’ It’s a degree moral, but it’s also what you’re supposed to do as a leader.” WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: NEW FBI DIRECTOR: -- Trump named Chris Christie loyalist Chris Wray, who defended the governor through the Bridgegate scandal, as his new FBI director. Way is a white collar criminal defense attorney who led the Justice Department’s Criminal Division during the George W. Bush administration. (Matt Zapotosky reports on the surprise decision.) NEW POLLING: -- A fresh Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that the majority of Americans believe the president is interfering with the Russia investigations, Scott Clement and Emily Guskin report. Here are a few nuggets: MORE SHOES DROP: -- “The nation’s top intelligence official told associates in March that President Trump asked him if he could intervene with then-FBI Director James B. Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe,” Adam Entous scooped last night. “On March 22, less than a week after being confirmed by the Senate, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats attended a briefing at the White House together with officials from several government agencies. As the briefing was wrapping up, Trump asked everyone to leave the room except for Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. The president then started complaining about the FBI investigation and Comey’s handling of it, said officials familiar with the account Coats gave to associates. Two days earlier, Comey had confirmed in a congressional hearing that the bureau was probing whether Trump’s campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 race. After the encounter, Coats discussed the conversation with other officials and decided that intervening with Comey as Trump had suggested would be inappropriate.” Why this is a huge deal: “The events involving Coats show the president went further than just asking intelligence officials to deny publicly the existence of any evidence showing collusion during the 2016 election, as The Washington Post reported in May. The interaction with Coats indicates that Trump aimed to enlist top officials to have Comey curtail the bureau’s probe.” -- Before he was fired, Comey told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president, fearing that Trump would probe Comey on the bureau’s Russia investigation. The New York Times' Michael S. Schmidt and Matt Apuzzo reported last night. “Mr. Comey believed Mr. Sessions should protect the F.B.I. from White House influence ... and pulled him aside after a meeting in February to tell him that private interactions between the F.B.I. director and the president were inappropriate. But Mr. Sessions could not guarantee that the president would not try to talk to Mr. Comey alone again … [Comey’s] unwillingness to be alone with the president reflected how deeply Mr. Comey distrusted Mr. Trump, who Mr. Comey believed was trying to undermine the F.B.I.’s independence as it conducted a highly sensitive investigation into links between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia.” PALACE INTRIGUE: -- White House sources reveal that Sessions offered to resign recently due to mounting tensions with the president. Robert Costa and Sari Horwitz report: “The strain between the two began after Sessions recused himself in March from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. … Trump learned of the attorney general’s decision shortly before Sessions announced it at a news conference. The president’s anger has lingered for months…It is unclear when Sessions offered to resign, and Trump refused the offer. The moment was brief and Sessions made the suggestion after weeks of Trump’s disgruntlement and tense private meetings, according to the two people close to the White House who requested anonymity to speak candidly. One big reason Trump may not have accepted: He could be stuck for months with Rod Rosenstein"
"The Health 202: If Obamacare repeal was a football team, Republicans are going to the Super Bowl","THE PROGNOSIS Imagine Obamacare repeal as a football team. It has just made it to the Super Bowl. Late yesterday afternoon, the Senate parliamentarian (read my profile of her) gave the thumbs-up to the House-passed GOP bill overhauling the Affordable Care Act, despite speculation that it might contain some elements that would ultimately prove fatal and force the House to take another vote on it. But Republicans have not yet claimed the Vince Lombardi trophy. The initial score simply means that the American Health Care Act complies with overall budget reconciliation rules -- the process Republicans are using to pass a health-care bill so they can bypass Senate Democrats with just a simple majority. But it is a big first step for Republicans who have struggled to make good on their seven-year-old pledge to throw out much of Obamacare in favor of a different system. But now there's a second hurdle. Each of the AHCA's individual provisions will be subject to challenge by Democrats in a process known as a Byrd bath"" and must be stripped out if the parliamentarian decides they aren’t directly enough related to federal spending. This process"
The Health 202: Senate Republicans are not being transparent when it comes to health care,"THE PROGNOSIS Lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, tend to head behind closed doors when they're trying to craft big -- and frequently controversial -- legislation. But Senate Republicans aren’t even grasping at the pretense of transparency as they attempt to craft a bill overhauling the Affordable Care Act. Charges of secrecy have become a big health-care attack line around the ACA. Bitter about the final legislative maneuvers Democrats went through to pass the 2010 health-care law -- and how they were shut out of final negotiations -- Republicans for years grumbled about how it all went down, repeating out-of-context the line used by top Democrat Nancy Pelosi that “we have to pass the bill so you can find out what’s in it.” Yet when it was their turn to rewrite health-care policy, the same could be said of them -- or worse. Charges of secrecy beset the House Republican negotiations one week before the attempt to vote on their measure to replace Obamacare. Opponents of that effort dramatized their efforts to find"" the measure -- which only GOP lawmakers were allowed to access in a basement room --  and silly social media stunts such as House Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (Md.) posting his search on Facebook Live:   Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul (R) also made a show of trying to unearth the measure: I have been told that the House Obamacare bill is under lock & key"
Have Republicans turned into partisan sheep on health care?,"The latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll confirms that most Americans really do not like the GOP’s American Health Care Act. Republicans like it, just not what is in it. That’s not as unusual as one might think given the current political climate. Here are the basic numbers: More Americans have an unfavorable view of the plan than a favorable one (55 percent vs. 31 percent, respectively). The share with favorable views of the AHCA is about 20 percentage points lower than the share with favorable views (49 percent) of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA). The majority of Republicans (67 percent) have a favorable view of the AHCA. This month’s survey finds the public has increasingly negative views of how their health care will be affected by proposed changes. In December 2016, after the presidential election but before the release of the Republican plan, less than one-third of the public thought their health care would get worse if the 2010 health care law was repealed. This month’s survey, fielded after House Republicans passed the AHCA, finds larger shares say the cost of health care for them and their family (45 percent), their ability to get and keep health insurance (34 percent), and the quality of their own health care will get worse if Congress passes the AHCA (34 percent). President Trump has succeeded in making the Affordable Care Act more popular than ever before. Americans by a 49 percent to 42 percent plurality like Obamacare, now that they might lose it. And those Republicans who really like the GOP plan? They either do not know what is in it or are so partisan they feel compelled to approve of things they do not like. For example, some key provisions garner very little support: Shifting more of the expense from younger to older people (19 percent), allowing insurers to charge more for sick people (22 percent) and cutting support for poorer Americans (26 percent). As for the jumbo tax cut for the rich, only 30 percent of Republicans say that would make them more likely to support the plan. Among all Americans, opposition to these provisions ranges from 49 percent to 65 percent. More striking, even Republicans know the bill does not match Trump’s promises: Three-fourths (76 percent) of the public thinks the health care plan recently passed by the House does not fulfill most of the promises President Trump has made about health care while 14 percent say it fulfills most or all of his promises. This viewpoint is shared regardless of party identification with majorities of Democrats (86 percent), independents (79 percent), and Republicans (59 percent) saying the AHCA fulfills some or none of the promises President Trump has made about health care. In short, Republican House members have voted for something far less popular than the ACA. Even Republicans who say they like it (Trump plan = Good!) don’t like what it contains. In other words, those who like it now may not be thrilled once they find out it contains all sorts of things they do not like. Republicans should also worry about the intensity of opinion. Some 40 percent have a “very unfavorable” view of the AHCA; only 12 percent have a “very favorable” view. One might say that lawmakers who recklessly voted for a bill they hadn’t yet scored and which did not do the things they promised were simply reflecting the blind partisanship of their fellow Republicans. Apparently it never dawned on many GOP lawmakers that their job is to make an honest, independent judgment of the bill’s particulars and then explain themselves to voters. Rather, they envision themselves as partisan soldiers who vote first and justify their actions later. Likewise, it never dawned on many Republicans to stop reflexively supporting whatever has an “R” or “Trump” next to it. Sadly, all of this confirms the degree to which rank partisanship, approaching irrational tribal loyalty, and self-selecting news have come to dominate American politics. This bodes ill for the Republic and our ability to navigate through complex challenges.

The GOP’s utter confusion on health care,"As with the Middle East “peace process” the quest for a health-care bill to pass the Senate rests on a false assumption: All we need are really clever negotiators and the will to pursue a deal. Call this the myth of the “there must be a solution.” It’s as false for health care as it is for peace in our time between the Israelis and the Palestinians. On health care, we are solemnly instructed to watch  the 13 or so GOP senators who are supposedly working on this task. They are fully engaged! Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is talking to Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine)! The problem is not primarily in that group or even in the Senate. It’s not even in the House, although recalcitrant and irresponsible leaders who would vote to transform the health-care system are problematic. No, the problem is that a majority or at least a large plurality of the Republican Congress is selling something even Republicans do not want. A few data points caught my eye. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that “a majority of Americans want to see the president and Congress increase spending on veteran’s medical care (77 percent), medical research to find cures for major illnesses (58 percent), and Medicare (57 percent). The only health area that has a larger share of the public saying they want the president and Congress to decrease spending rather than increase spending is on efforts to improve health for people in developing countries, with one-third saying they want to see spending decreased in this area.” A Pew survey found that “61% of Republicans and 95% of Democrats would maintain or increase funding for health care in general. It also found that 61% of Republicans and 93% of Democrats would maintain or increase spending for ‘economic assistance to needy people in the U.S.'” To say that Republicans are working on the wrong thing in the wrong way would underestimate the enormity of the gap between GOP leadership objectives and voters, even their own. GOP lawmakers again and again have made the mistake of assuming people want to get rid of the Affordable Care Act and get something with “less federal interference,” that is less control and less federal support for health care. That is what some of them want. It’s not what the public wants. Poll after polls shows Americans want lower out-of-pocket costs. (Kaiser’s poll, for example, found: “When asked about a series of health care priorities for President Trump and Congress to act on, about six in ten of the public say lowering the amount individuals pay for health care (63 percent) and lowering the cost of prescription drugs (60 percent) should each be a ‘top priority’ for President Trump and Congress.” Unless the GOP wants to put more federal money into health care to give people more benefits (for the same or less money, of course!) they will not have a meeting of the minds with the voters. Putting more money into health care is about the last thing the House GOP will stand for. So, you see, the notion of repealing the ACA to give something less generous has been, as we have said from the get-go, doomed from the start. Hung up on an unattainable promise (Repeal and replace!), GOP senators can work as long as they like. That effort is likely to be entirely wasted. And it’s a shame. Even Democrats concede the ACA has real issues, some of which might be amenable to more decentralized solutions (which the GOP might like). That won’t happen so long as the Senate toils away at something the public overwhelmingly opposes. Likewise, Medicaid is a program deeply in need of reform, but so long as the GOP is hung up on huge cuts (to pay for tax cuts for the rich) the reform debate gets subsumed. It’s hard to remember a worse case of political confusion by a “victorious” party that six months ago won majorities in both houses and the White House. It’s what comes from residing inside the right-wing media bubble. You come to believe things that just are not so.

The Health 202: Meet the referee in the GOP effort to replace Obamacare,"THE PROGNOSIS Washington is filled with people who talk much but affect little. Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough is the opposite —  she intentionally stays out of the spotlight but wields enormous influence in proceedings on the Senate floor. As the Capitol Hill version of a referee in the contentious health-care debate, MacDonough will soon exercise broad authority in considering the fate of the House GOP health-care bill. She could also rule on a Senate version, if and when it materializes. Picture this. Sometime in the next few weeks, four Democratic attorneys and four Republican ones will file into the ornate LBJ room just steps from the Senate chamber to consider a bill overhauling the Affordable Care Act. They’ll sit at a long table before MacDonough. Democrats will argue the GOP bill known as the American Health Care Act (ACHA) bleeds over the boundaries of what can be accomplished under the budget rules known as “reconciliation.” Republicans will insist the ACHA complies with those rules by containing only provisions that affect federal spending. MacDonough will listen carefully to both sides. She’ll ask questions. She won’t appear to favor one side over the other. And when she finally makes a decision, it will be based on her best understanding of Senate rules and past precedent —  not on whether she personally approves or disapproves of Obamacare or the effort to revamp it, say multiple friends and former co-workers. David Schiappa, who for years worked closely with MacDonough as secretary for Senate Republicans, said he feels she is completely unbiased and she cares about the institution and she follows the precedent that has been established.""

Why Republicans are so bad at health care,"Republicans have had seven years to figure out how they want to replace Obamacare, and this is what they’ve come up with: a plan that, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, would lead to 23 million more people not having insurance and, in states that wanted to, sick people being burdened with much, much higher costs. Maybe they needed eight years? The real question here is why. Why weren’t Republicans able to put a plan together that people actually, you know, like — theirs is polling in the low 20s — and why did it take so long? And the answer is pretty simple: Republicans are philosophically opposed to redistribution, but health care is all about redistribution. For a long time, they tried to wish that away, and it was only when that wasn’t an option anymore that they moved on to Plan B: trying to pass the least redistributive bill they can before anyone noticed how much it doesn’t redistribute. That last part isn’t working so well. Now, if we could start from scratch, Republicans would like our health-care system to work the way Singapore’s does. Everyone would have catastrophic insurance to protect against true medical emergencies and then use health savings accounts to pay for routine care out of pocket. It’s not just that this would make people pay their own way as much as possible; it’s also the idea that making them do so would make them shop around for the best deal. There are two problems with this, though. First, as economist Ken Arrow pointed out long ago, picking the right medical care is a lot different from picking the right car. People don’t know enough to be good comparison shoppers, and they’re not going to scrimp when their health is on the line. But second — and more importantly — we don’t have the low health-care costs you need to make all this work. Singapore's government, you see, has been able to keep costs down because it owns most of the country’s hospitals, it employs a lot of the doctors, and it subsidizes cheaper treatments to try to get people to choose them. The result is that they spend only about 5 percent of their GDP on health care, compared with the 18 percent we do. Which is really all you need to know about why their system works for them but wouldn’t for us. It’s a lot easier for people to pay for their own health care when that costs three or four times less what it does here. How have Republicans dealt with this? Well, for the most part, they haven’t. They still want people to use HSAs, to pay higher deductibles, to have more “skin in the game” that will supposedly turn them from patients into consumers — never mind that that would just price a lot of people out of the market altogether. That’s actually a feature, not a bug. Health care is only a major priority for Republicans insofar as they can make it redistribute less money. So while conservative wonks might be focused on trying to make the health-care system more of a free market, conservative politicians are more interested in what that means for their tax cuts. Just look at Trumpcare. It’s only a health-care bill to the extent that it takes health care away from the poor and middle class to pay for a tax cut for the rich. Indeed, over the next decade, it would cut Medicaid by $834 billion and health-care subsidies by $276 billion, all to finance a trillion dollars’ worth of tax cuts mostly benefiting wealthy investors. But that was still too redistributive for the far-right House Freedom Caucus. They didn’t just want to stop the rich from having to pay for the poor. They also wanted to stop the healthy from having to pay for the sick. So they added an amendment that would allow states to opt out of Obamacare’s basic rules. Insurance companies wouldn’t have to charge people with preexisting conditions the same as people without them, and could sell plans that didn’t include “essential benefits” such as hospitalizations, mental health and maternity care. That would allow young, healthy people to save money by buying bare-bones plans, while older, sicker people would have to pay more for theirs since they’d be the only ones buying those types of comprehensive plans. The insurance market, in other words, would bifurcate. Healthy people would buy affordable plans that didn’t cover a lot, and sick people would try to buy unaffordable ones that did — until they couldn’t. Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who more than anyone else pushed for these changes, was reportedly reduced to tears when he found out that they’d mean a lot of people with preexisting conditions would lose their coverage, which makes you wonder what he thought they were doing. The rest of the GOP sure knew. "
Senate Republicans who are gunning for Obamacare are caught in a trap,"Republican senators who are being asked today about the brutal Congressional Budget Office score of the health-care plan that passed the House have a ready answer: That doesn’t have anything to do with us. Numerous senators released statements saying that the CBO score just shows that the American Health Care Act (AHCA) is a radioactive fungus, which is why they’re starting over on their own bill. “I am opposed to the American Health Care Act (AHCA) in its current form,” said Dean Heller, who may be the most vulnerable Senate Republican up for reelection in 2018. “This bill does not do enough to address Nevada’s Medicaid population or protect Nevadans with pre-existing conditions.” Bill Cassidy agreed: “Congress’s focus must be to lower premiums with coverage which passes the Jimmy Kimmel Test. The AHCA does not.” (The “Jimmy Kimmel test” would be that no one is denied coverage because of his or her income.) Susan Collins put out a statement listing many of the horrors in the CBO score. Ted Cruz said that Senate Republicans are “not spending a great deal of time dwelling on one scoring estimate for a proposal that’s not going to be the underlying bill.” But here’s their quandary: As much as they might like to distance themselves from what the House did, the AHCA has made their job even harder, creating problems they may have no way to solve. Why is that, if they’re starting fresh? The reason is that House Republicans, through a combination of bottomless cruelty and PR bumbling, have completely transformed the health-care debate. To begin with, they succeeded in making the Affordable Care Act popular, something Democrats never managed to achieve in the seven years since it passed. They did so by threatening to take things away from people, activating their natural loss aversion (the tendency to intensely fear losing what you have) and bringing attention to the parts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that are most popular. Consider, for instance, the question of preexisting conditions. When we were debating the first version of the AHCA, it was part of the discussion but it didn’t dominate it, since that bill included only a roundabout assault on the protections the ACA affords the tens of millions of Americans who have a medical history that in the bad old days would have gotten them denied coverage. After that first version failed, Republicans succeeded in securing support from the ultra-right Freedom Caucus for the second version in part by inserting a provision allowing states to opt out of the preexisting condition protection. When they did that, preexisting conditions suddenly became the single most important element of the discussion. And while Republican senators might try to dismiss the CBO score, it won’t be easy, because what the score (and the news coverage it receives) does is turn complex policy problems into acute political problems, by making things very concrete. The CBO says: The effects will be A, B and C. That then arms Democrats with a series of talking points they’ll repeat over and over, which have the benefit of nonpartisan backing. For instance, how many times have you heard Democrats say, “24 million people will lose coverage!” since the first CBO score was released? About a zillion, right? The figure for the latest version of the AHCA is 23 million, but both numbers are vivid and shocking. Democrats will also be able to point to passages such as this one in the latest CBO score, which, after noting that premiums for young and healthy people could be reduced, says this: However, over time, less healthy individuals (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would be unable to purchase comprehensive coverage with premiums close to those under current law and might not be able to purchase coverage at all. The message in the CBO report is that young and healthy people will benefit, but older people or those who have preexisting conditions will be in big trouble. Or how about this passage: People living in states modifying the EHBs [essential health benefits] who used services or benefits no longer included in the EHBs would experience substantial increases in out-of-pocket spending on health care or would choose to forgo the services. Services or benefits likely to be excluded from the EHBs in some states include maternity care, mental health and substance abuse benefits, rehabilitative and habilitative services, and pediatric dental benefits. In particular, out-of-pocket spending on maternity care and mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year for the nongroup enrollees who would use those services. Moreover, the ACA’s ban on annual and lifetime limits on covered benefits would no longer apply to health benefits not defined as essential in a state. That sounds pretty awful, doesn’t it? And keep in mind that Republicans have been using people’s displeasure over high out-of-pocket costs as a bludgeon against the ACA, while not mentioning that their plans would all increase out-of-pocket costs, particularly in the form of high deductibles for bare-bones plans. These and other points the CBO makes will continue to frame the news coverage of the issue, focusing everyone’s attention on a particular set of questions. Democrats are already zeroing in on those points. As Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said in a statement responding to the CBO score: “Under Trumpcare, patients and families are going to face higher costs around every corner.” As a result, Republicans in the Senate can’t fudge or gloss over anything related to those issues. So here are some questions Republicans are going to have to answer as they formulate their plan, whether they want to or not: These are questions Republicans really don’t want to answer, because when they do, the response from most Americans upon learning what the GOP plans would actually do is, “Oh, hell no.” Now here’s the real problem the Senate faces: A plan built on conservative principles of minimal regulation and minimal government-provided insurance can’t solve these problems, by definition. The market won’t guarantee coverage for those with preexisting conditions; only government can do that. The market can’t provide real coverage for people with low incomes; only government can. We’ve seen some attempts by Republicans to change the questions around which this debate is revolving — House Speaker Paul Ryan keeps insisting that if 23 million people lose coverage it would be something to celebrate because it would mean they’d be exercising their freedom of choice — but those efforts have failed. The debate is now established on liberal terms. That means Senate Republicans are left with two choices: Write a conservative plan like the one the House produced, which will be spectacularly unpopular, or write a plan that looks a lot like the ACA with just some minor tweaks here and there. They’re brainstorming to see whether they can devise a perfect solution that is true to their beliefs and that the public will embrace. The problem is it doesn’t exist.

"The Daily 202: Five fresh setbacks for Republicans, who just can’t catch a break","With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Republicans just cannot catch a break, but many of their wounds are self-inflicted. -- Greg Gianforte, the Republican nominee in today’s special congressional election in Montana, has been charged with misdemeanor assault after allegedly “body slamming” a reporter for the Guardian. Gianforte, who has been seen as the favorite in the race to succeed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, faces a maximum $500 fine or six months in jail if he is convicted, Dave Weigel reports from Montana. In an audio recording published by the Guardian, reporter Ben Jacobs can be heard asking Gianforte to respond to the Congressional Budget Office's new score of the American Health Care Act. After Gianforte tells Jacobs to ask his spokesman, the candidate loses it and begins to scream: “I’m sick and tired of you guys! … Get the hell out of here! Get the hell out of here!” A Fox News crew was in the room when it happened, and veteran correspondent Alicia Acuna has written a damning first-person account: “Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him. At no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte.” The unapologetic campaign released a defiant statement that attempted to slime the respected reporter as a “liberal.” His spokesman claimed that Gianforte asked Jacobs to lower the recorder before he got physical, but the audio tape and the eyewitness accounts undercut this version of events. Two of the state’s largest newspapers quickly withdrew their editorial endorsements of Gianforte. “We're at a loss for words, the Billings Gazette wrote. “And as people who wrangle words on a minute-by-minute basis, that doesn't happen often.” The Missoulian’s editorial board said “there is no doubt that Gianforte committed an act of terrible judgment that, if it doesn’t land him in jail, also shouldn’t land him in the U.S. House of Representatives.” This is the newspaper many Montanans are waking up to right now: Bozeman Daily Chronicle election day front page, via @wabermes pic.twitter.com/PgUcG77WjD But, but, but: Heavy early voting means that Gianforte may win anyway. Perversely, a physical altercation with a reporter might also help him coalesce/gin up his base. (Donald Trump won Montana last November by 20 points.) “What turnout will look like in a special election is hard to predict, but if it’s similar to 2014, 62 percent of votes have already been cast early,” Philip Bump explains. Bottom line: In many ways, it is now worse for national Republicans if Gianforte wins. If he loses, the NRCC can pretty easily explain it away by calling him a terrible candidate. The incident makes it harder for anyone to draw conclusions about the broader national political environment from the outcome. If he wins, though, Gianforte suddenly becomes another headache for Paul Ryan. The ongoing legal issue will be covered as a major story, and his every move in the Capitol will be tracked aggressively by the press. He becomes a liability for the party in 2018, especially if his new colleagues defend him. ANOTHER UNFORCED ERROR: -- Jeff Sessions concealed his contacts with Russian officials when filling out his security clearance form to be the nation’s highest-ranking law enforcement official. Sari Horwitz reports: “Sessions came under fire earlier this year for not disclosing to the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing that … he met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential election … In March, Sessions recused himself from investigations related to the 2016 presidential campaign after The Washington Post reported the two meetings. … The security clearance form requires anyone applying for a security clearance to list ‘any contact’ that he or his family had with a foreign government or its representatives over the past seven years.” CNN's Manu Raju and Evan Perez, who broke the story last night, explain the DOJ's damage-control effort: Sessions initially listed a year's worth of meetings with foreign officials on the security clearance form"
The Health 202: Here's why the CBO report is bad news for Republicans on health care,"THE PROGNOSIS The final word is in: The House Republican bill to replace large parts of the Affordable Care Act would save $119 billion over a decade but cost 23 million Americans their health coverage. Those figures are actually pretty similar to initial estimates for the House's American Health Care Act -- before Republicans added in some last-minute amendments changes. Yet when the CBO released its score late Wednesday afternoon, it reignited a heated debate in Washington over the ongoing GOP effort to ditch big provisions in President Obama’s health-care law – an issue that took a temporary back seat amid all the drama over President Trump’s relationship with Russia and his treatment of former FBI Director James B. Comey. Democrats and ACA backers ripped into the GOP measure, noting that it would roll back most of the progress made toward reducing the country’s uninsured and could result in plans becoming impossibly expensive for some people, especially older Americans. Democrats were quick to start bashing the numbers: Once again, @SpeakerRyan is celebrating a bill that kicks millions off coverage & shreds protections for those still covered. #Trumpcare https://t.co/SjvWpKVYVA Republicans were less unified -- when they responded at all, that is -- with House leadership defending the bill while some moderate lawmakers said it falls far short. Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) championed the fact that the bill is estimated to lower the deficit, and premiums -- which, as we've noted before, is a new focus for Republicans as they've set aside some of their other Obamacare criticisms. This @USCBO report again confirms that the American Health Care Act will lower premiums and the deficit. https://t.co/kmjeUP2qqF pic.twitter.com/YJnXUyD3xO House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) chimed in: The CBO reports yet again that our plan will keep a promise #Obamacare broke—premiums will go down. https://t.co/sHMmwdtD8N Senate Republicans were far more muted, however. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not even issue a statement, and downplayed expectations in a Reuters interview yesterday:  I don't know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment. But that's the goal. And exactly what the composition of that (bill) is I'm not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose"
The CBO confirms: The Republican health-care bill is rotten legislation,"When the Congressional Budget Office finally released its scoring of the American Health Care Act, it seemed anti-climactic, if not irrelevant. The Senate is not bothering to take up the AHCA at all. The CBO score, to the delight of Democrats, does remind us how counterproductive is the GOP House bill, which every member will have to defend in 2018. The CBO states that the AHCA reduces the federal deficit by $119 billion over 10 years, some $32 billion less than the previous version. (Had it been a negative number the House would arguably have had to revote on it to make it reconciliation-ready.) As Democrats are all too eager to point out, the savings comes from taking benefits away from poor and middle-class individuals. (“The largest savings would come from reductions in outlays for Medicaid and from the replacement of the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) subsidies for nongroup health insurance with new tax credits for nongroup health insurance,” the report says.) The beneficiaries here are the rich: “The largest increases in the deficit would come from repealing or modifying tax provisions in the ACA that are not directly related to health insurance coverage — such as repealing a surtax on net investment income, repealing annual fees imposed on health insurers, and reducing the income threshold for determining the tax deduction for medical expenses.” These taxes fall largely on the richest taxpayers. That’s not the worst of it for Republicans. First, once again we see that the GOP plan will substantially increase the number of uninsured. The CBO states: 14 million more people would be uninsured under H.R. 1628 than under current law. The increase in the number of uninsured people relative to the number projected under current law would reach 19 million in 2020 and 23 million in 2026. In 2026, an estimated 51 million people under age 65 would be uninsured, compared with 28 million who would lack insurance that year under current law. What’s more, it does nothing to combat the central problem with Obamacare, according to Republicans, namely sustainability of the system. The problem arises from the “fix,” the Meadows-MacArthur amendment that makes the bill worse than  the original: About one-sixth of the population resides in areas in which the nongroup market would start to become unstable beginning in 2020. That instability would result from market responses to decisions by some states to waive two provisions of federal law, as would be permitted under H.R. 1628. One type of waiver would allow states to modify the requirements governing essential health benefits (EHBs), which set minimum standards for the benefits that insurance in the nongroup and small-group markets must cover. A second type of waiver would allow insurers to set premiums on the basis of an individual’s health status if the person had not demonstrated continuous coverage; that is, the waiver would eliminate the requirement for what is termed community rating for premiums charged to such people. CBO and [Joint Taxation Committee] anticipate that most healthy people applying for insurance in the nongroup market in those states would be able to choose between premiums based on their own expected health care costs (medically underwritten premiums) and premiums based on the average health care costs for people who share the same age and smoking status and who reside in the same geographic area (community-rated premiums). By choosing the former, people who are healthier than average would be able to purchase nongroup insurance with relatively low premiums. CBO and JCT expect that, as a consequence, the waivers in those states would have another effect: Community-rated premiums would rise over time, and people who are less healthy (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive nongroup health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all — despite the additional funding that would be available under H.R. 1628 to help reduce premiums. (Emphasis added.) In other words the GOP claim that they protected those with preexisting conditions is false. As for out-of-pocket costs, another GOP complaint about the Affordable Care Act, “Although premiums would decline, on average, in states that chose to narrow the scope of [essential health benefits], some people enrolled in nongroup insurance would experience substantial increases in what they would spend on health care. People living in states modifying the EHBs who used services or benefits no longer included in the EHBs would experience substantial increases in out-of-pocket spending on health care or would choose to forgo the services.” In short, the sickest people will wind up paying a lot more. Republicans falsely state there is nothing new here. In fact, the CBO helps unmask the bogus claim that the Republicans protected people with preexisting conditions. The more one looks at the bill, the more one sees it “succeeds” in only one regard — giving big tax cuts to the very rich. Democrats are going to have a field day with this.

Why this clown Congress won’t accomplish anything,"When, say, in 2020 Republicans look back on 2017 and try to explain why they accomplished so little, the temptation will be to blame President Trump. He never sent up concrete legislation. His staff was discombobulated. He oversold what was possible. He didn’t have a clear idea what was possible. He was enmeshed in scandals that sapped the oxygen out of the political debate. All that is true, and yet Congress has only itself to blame for what now appears to be a year in which the repeal and replacement of Obamacare goes nowhere and tax reform never happens. Consider this: The people granted Congress the power to write laws, raise revenues, and spend and borrow money on behalf of the United States. There is no power more consequential, and so the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate face the voters every two years. But more than that, frequent elections allow the people to have a say in their government’s decisions. Yet for decades, Congress has let this power atrophy—thereby depriving the people of their voice. … Congress must continue to write laws clearly and concisely, make sure agencies adhere to the letter of the law, guard the power of the purse by completing the appropriations process, and conduct robust oversight of the executive branch. That comes from House Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s “A Better Way” task force report on the Constitution. The gap between rhetoric favoring rebalancing of power away from the executive and toward Congress; the promise of transparent, conscientious lawmaking; and the commitment to rigorous oversight have all been sacrificed in a spasm of partisanship and frenetic rush to give the president quick wins on immensely complicated legislation. The result has been the most haphazard, counterproductive and unpopular major piece of legislation ever to pass the House, the American Health Care Act. Passed with no Congressional Budget Office score (due out this afternoon), no fact-gathering hearings and no consultation with Democrats, the process by which the AHCA passed guaranteed a substantively incoherent product. That is precisely what the House delivered, a bill so bad that the Senate has chosen to ignore it entirely and start anew. In the Senate, the process seems scarcely improved. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) couldn’t take it anymore, as HuffPost reported: “It’s a very awkward process, at best,” he told reporters [on Tuesday]. “There are no experts. There’s no actuarials. … Typically, in a hearing, you’d have people coming in and you’d also have the media opining about if a hearing took place, and X came in and made comments.” Corker’s frustrations come as Republicans continue to struggle with how, exactly, to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The House barely passed its bill, which is going nowhere, earlier this month. Senate leaders delegated the task of drawing up a bill in that chamber to a group of 13 Republicans who have been quietly meeting. Corker said he went to one of their meetings to offer input because he’s worried they’re going to unveil a final bill that hasn’t been shaped by public hearings or media analyses. “Those are all informative, right?” Corker asked. “This process, not being that manner, can create a lot of blind spots. To me, I’d rather have the input as we move along than a bill be produced and all of a sudden it’s the product and then everybody opines.” It’s a mystery why Republicans did not follow the thorough, patient process that the Democrats undertook to pass the Affordable Care Act. Eleven months of hearings, multiple presidential speeches and public events, a full-blown markup process and CBO scoring culminated in the successful, albeit party-line, passage of the most-far reaching legislation in decades. This is how the legislative process is supposed to work. Why have Republicans rejected this approach? For one thing, congressional leaders do not trust their own members. Again and again they proved themselves to be unrealistic, if not unhinged. The vast majority has never been in the majority with a GOP president (i.e. when what they did mattered). Secondly, Republicans never wrestled with fundamental questions (Will the public accept a system without the promise of universal coverage?). They’ve operated in a never-neverland of rhetorical bogeymen without serious consideration of the ramifications of changed expectations about health care. They never devised something as good as, if not better than, Obamacare without the parts of Obamacare they did not like (e.g. taxes, the individual mandate). Third, their own lack of patience fed the White House conviction that all of this could be done quickly and easily. No one had the courage to tell the president how complicated health care is (Who knew?!) and that his goals were irreconcilable (better coverage, cheaper coverage and no taxes). And finally, Republicans have been attempting something that has very little political support — rolling back benefits for lower- and middle-income Americans while handing the rich a jumbo tax cut. If you are not going to be honest with one another or with the public, you resort to a rushed, secretive process that tries to ram through legislation before opposition can mount. We have seen the degree to which the GOP-led Congress is unable or unwilling to perform the basic task of legislating and of oversight (ignoring conflicts of interest, replete evidence of possible emoluments clause violations, turning a blind eye toward apparent obstruction of justice, deferring to ill-conceived — and, in some cases, unconstitutional — executive orders). Republicans’ performance to date suggests that the GOP is not capable of governing. Thankfully, in a democratic system, there is a solution for that.

California Democrats choose new chair as divisions break into the open,"At their weekend convention in Sacramento, California Democrats elected a new chairman, heard updates on the fight in Congress from the key player in the Trump/Russia investigation, and were encouraged to make universal health-care coverage happen in their state. They still managed to leave the city in a brawl over the chairmanship and the national party’s refusal to run on single-payer health care. The convention, which came after supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders won swaths of delegate slots across the state, demonstrated not just the divisions inside the party but how easily they can be exploited. In California, Democrats have pushed the Republican Party to near-irrelevancy, and pushed through a progressive agenda of social spending paid for by higher taxes. But progressives showed up with a mission: electing Kimberly Ellis to chair the party after eight years of John Burton, a proudly foul-mouthed operative who had never concealed his distaste for the Sanders primary challenge. According to the Los Angeles Times, California Nurses Association/National Nurses United was the prime mover behind rallies and demonstrations demanding that the party back single payer, and heckling if Democrats were weak-kneed about it. “They’re going to be telling you how bad Trump is and how we should all be okay with them because Trump’s so bad,” said NNU’s RoseAnn DeMoro, according to reporter Christine Mai-Duc. “You guys are going to want to boo. There’s a lot of good people to boo.” Indeed, coverage of the convention — which determined control of the strongest Democratic Party in the country — focused acutely on the public shows of division. NNU, which specializes in protests and visibility, made sure that activists were in force demanding single payer; in the crowd, plenty booed “corporate Democrats.” Republicans had a field day with a clip, recorded by the Sacramento Bee, of Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez trying to give a speech at a reception and being shouted over by the activists. “Hey, shut the f— up or go outside, all right?” Burton said. Coverage of that moment, and of the convention’s main speeches, demonstrated how much of an appetite there is on the left for stories of Democrats being weak on policy — or sidelining policy to discuss the Russia story. A Saturday story in the New York Observer focused on the heckles of Perez and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s speech. “Pelosi, who also doesn’t support single payer health care, focused her speech at the California Democratic Party Convention on Russia as well,” wrote reporter Michael Saitano. That version of the story rocketed around Twitter over the weekend. In fact, Pelosi dealt with the Russia probe in around 90 seconds of her speech, saying that Democrats would “protect our democracy by demanding the truth about a Trump-Russia connection” and that “Trump and the Republicans in Congress must stop stonewalling our request for an independent investigation.” She spent more than twice as much time on the “life and death consequences” of defeating the “moral monstrosity of Trumpcare.” “The Affordable Care Act enables every state to create a public option,” Pelosi said. “I believe that California must take the lead.” That was less than activists wanted, and in video of the remarks, cries of “single payer” could be heard rumbling under Pelosi’s speech. Yet the larger division came with the chairman vote — which Ellis lost, and Los Angeles County Chair Eric Bauman won. Instead of leaving the weekend on a note of celebration, Democrats left in a tiff, with Ellis refusing to concede the close race before an audit of the vote was conducted. "

The Health 202: Trump is behaving to insurers like a commitment-phobe,"THE PROGNOSIS President Trump is playing coy with insurers who want an “I do” from him on getting billions of dollars of extra subsidy payments for low-income people under the Affordable Care Act. The insurers are threatening to break up with the Obamacare marketplaces without a long-term commitment from his administration that they’ll get the money. Late last week, the White House told us that it will pony up in May. But it isn’t committing to making any of the payments beyond this month. A spokesman told me that no final decisions have yet been made, and all options are on the table. But what insurers need is certainty as they price their plans for next year and try to decide whether they’ll even be able to afford selling ACA marketplace coverage at all – not for Trump to put them on a month-to-month subsidy payment plan. (A quick explanation of what we’re talking about here. These federal subsidies are different from the tax credits to help people pay their monthly premium for Obamacare marketplace plans. Known as cost-sharing reductions, the payments reimburse insurers for discounting to low-income people the extra costs associated with a plan – such as a co-payment for a prescription drug. Insurers must provide the discounts, even if they’re not reimbursed by the feds.) Today is a key date in the saga. The Trump administration must indicate to the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C. how it wants to handle an ongoing lawsuit over the subsidy payments. The Health 202 (and many in Washington, for that matter) will be watching closely, because things could go a number of different ways. It's also the beginning of what's likely to be a wild week in health-care politics on Capitol Hill. The Congressional Budget Office is expected to release its score of the latest House health measure (rumors are that will happen Wednesday), which will reveal whether the bill saves enough money to be considered under special budget rules designed to subject it to a simple-majority vote in the Senate. This score will be used to decide whether the American Health Care Act complies with overall rules allowing it to be considered under reconciliation."" But back to the subsidies. Most of the scenarios regarding them don’t look great for insurers or the stability of the marketplaces where the insurer exits and rate hikes of last year may be even more pronounced next year. There’s been a cascade of bad news in the past month"
"Democrats accuse White House of causing ACA tremors, then shifting blame","The on-again, off-again threat from the White House to shatter the Affordable Care Act appeared to be on again Friday, as Politico reported that President Trump “told aides in a Tuesday Oval Office meeting that he wants to end” subsidies for people who buy health insurance on the state and federal exchanges. The theory is audacious: Despite marking his fourth month in office, and despite the control his party holds over Congress, the plan from the president, party leaders and Republican campaign groups is to blame any increase on premiums on the Democrats. But so far, Republicans have stayed on message — and Democrats have struggled to draw attention to tremors in the insurance market that can be traced to the White House’s shaky management. “It’s very clear that President Trump and Republicans here in Congress are not interested in improving the exchanges,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said at a news conference this week. “President Trump said, ‘The best thing, politically, is to let Obamacare explode.’ Here’s the thing: They’ve been doing the detonating from Day One.” At issue are several vital components of the ACA, and the response of insurers to the White House’s on/off signaling. In his first week as president, Trump signed an executive order neutering the individual mandate, absolving the IRS from trying to collect a penalty from people who declined to buy insurance. The White House also briefly canceled advertising ahead of the ACA’s winter enrollment period — analysts argued that the decision cut down on new enrollees, even after the advertising started up again. But the subsidies fight has always been seen by Republicans as a way to make the ACA unaffordable, thereby kick-starting the “death spiral” that the current funding system prevents. Out of power, Republicans sued to stop the subsidies, arguing that they were illegally paid out because Congress had not specifically appropriated the money that the Obama administration was distributing. Today, the subsidies could be stopped by that lawsuit’s success or by the president’s decision. The wrinkle: Republicans are portraying any market failure not as a result of their management but as the basic ACA structure self-destructing. When the American Health Care Act was resurrected, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) led Republicans in citing the decision of Medica to pull out of Iowa’s exchange as proof of the ACA’s collapse. “Iowa is down to one insurer,” Ryan said. “Now that one insurer is saying that it will have to pull out of 94 of 99 counties. This is happening right now! This is a crisis, and it is happening right now!” In an interview with The Washington Post before the vote, Medica Vice President Geoff Bartsh cited the uncertainty over the government’s commitment to the ACA as “unknown risks” influencing the company’s decision. Yet since their push for repeal began in January, Republicans have talked about a “rescue” mission, portraying any market failures as inevitable. The urgency to pass the bill — which does not provide subsidies to people on the exchanges — is packaged as a response to the natural progress of the ACA. “Whatever they do, they need to act, because more people are losing their health care, premiums are continuing to rise,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in a Fox News interview this week, referring to the Senate. Not for the first time, the two parties are engaged in political messaging that assume alternative realities. Democrats clutch to polling that has universally found voters ready to blame Trump and Republicans if the health-care system spins out of control. In a Kaiser poll released last month, three-quarters of all voters — including 51 percent of Republicans — said that the president and Congress should make sure the current law works. A majority of Democrats and independents said that any further problems would be the fault of Republicans. Yet in that poll, just 34 percent of Republicans said that health insurance setbacks, such as higher premiums, would be the fault of Trump and Congress. Republican messaging plays not to the skeptics but to the base — and to a sense that Democrats would be hypocrites if they blamed anyone but themselves for a staggering ACA. “Last year, Democrats blamed the insurance companies. Now, they’re blaming Republicans,” wrote Republican Nationial Committee rapid-response director Michael Ahrens in a Friday email to reporters. “Not surprisingly, no one is buying it.” That messaging email, however, provided just three pieces of evidence. Two were CNN interviews in which Democrats were reminded that “insurers were leaving before Trump won.” One was a 2016 campaign clip of NBC reporting on higher premiums posing a risk for Democrats.

"If you work for Trump, it’s time to quit","I’ve been a Republican political consultant for almost 30 years, and I’ve dispensed a lot of private advice. But now it’s time for me to reach out publicly to my fellow Republicans working in the Trump administration. We really need to talk. Whether you’re a 20-something fresh off the campaign trail, or a seasoned Washington insider serving in the Cabinet, by now you’re painfully aware that you’re not making America great again; you’re barely making it to the end of the daily news cycle before your verbally incontinent boss, the putative leader of the free world, once again steers the proverbial car into a ditch. On every front, you’re faced with legal, political and moral hazards. The president’s job, and yours, is a lot harder than it looked, and you know the problem originates in the Oval Office. [I was fired for criticizing Trump. Getting rid of people like me hurts his agenda.] You hate that people are shying away from administration jobs in droves: Just this week, in rapid succession, Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Trey Gowdy withdrew their names from consideration as replacements for former FBI Director James Comey, the guy your boss fired. Whatever department you’re in, it’s a safe bet that it’s a whispering graveyard of empty appointments and unfilled jobs. I know: Many of you serving in Cabinet, sub-Cabinet and White House roles joined Team Trump in good faith, believing you could help steady the ship, smooth the rough edges and, just maybe, put some conservative policy wins up on the board. You could see that President Trump’s undisciplined style was risky, but you hoped the big show playing over at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. would provide you with cover to work steadily and enthusiastically on the administration’s legislative priorities. Some of you even bought into the ‘Merica First new nationalism. Many of you quietly assured friends in the Washington ecosystem that Trump would settle into his job — after all, just a few days after taking office, he assured us, “I can be the most presidential person ever.” You figured Trump would turn his political capital into big wins, and that his lack of interest in policy details would let you and your friends in Congress set the agenda. Sure, you knew you’d have to feed Trump’s ego and let him take a victory lap after every success, but you also thought you might claim a smidgen of credit for a popular infrastructure bill, a big tax cut, repeal of Obamacare or a host of other “easy” lifts. Because we’re all ambitious, right? It’s okay to admit it. Instead, your president botched Trumpcare 1.0 and contributed little as Speaker Paul Ryan managed to ram public-relations nightmare, Trumpcare 2.0, through the House at the cost of much political blood and treasure. Instead, Trump’s fumbles have left many members of Congress ducking town hall meetings like they’re in the witness protection program. The tax bill and the rest of Trump’s agenda are deader and more pungent than six-day-old fish. Maybe your particular bureau is still afloat, but you’re really not doing much except playing defense and wondering which of your colleagues is leaking to The Washington Post. You learned quickly that your job isn’t actually to serve the nation, manage your agency or fulfill the role you ostensibly play according to the White House org chart. In reality, you spend most of your time fluffing Trump’s ego. Either that or you’re making excuses for not being a more aggressive suck-up. If you’ve been ordained to appear on television as an administration surrogate, you know by now that your task isn’t to advocate for your agency or issue, but to lavish the president with praise. [I support Trump, but firing Comey was wrong] Now, you see the daily train wreck; you see a White House in turmoil and a president drawing an ever-tighter circle of family and corporate vassals around himself. You worry that the scandals and legal troubles, which have been rumbling on the horizon like a summer thunderstorm, are drawing nearer. You should worry. Every day you get up, slide into the seat of your Prius or Tahoe (and if you’re senior enough, exchange a few polite words with your driver) and check Twitter. Whatever it is that you’re feeling, it doesn’t feel anything like Morning in America. It feels like some faraway kleptocracy where the center hasn’t held, the airfield and radio station have fallen to the rebels, and the Maximum Leader is holed up in his secret bunker waiting for the other shoe to drop. Soon (and by soon, I mean now) you’ll have to make a choice. You’ll have to decide whether I’m here to help has morphed into I’m helping this president dismantle the republic. In D.C., principle is as rare as hen’s teeth, but, GOP friends, you can find it. You already know you can’t save the president because he doesn’t want to be saved. You already know there’s not another, better version of Trump getting ready to show up. You’re smart. You’re loyal. You’re sniffing the wind like a gazelle, nose filled with the scents of predators. You don’t want to break from the pack too soon, but there’s greater risk in waiting too long. When regimes collapse, dead-enders are the most fascinating to watch — the ones who end up with the profitable concessions and sought-after mistresses. You know already, though, that’s probably not you. So, ask yourself: When this regime falls, do you want to be among those who said “not me,” or do you want to go out like a Baath Party generalissimo? Sticking with Trump to the bitter end and pretending the unfolding chaos is just “fake news” won’t save your reputation as the walls close in. It won’t ease the judgment of history. It won’t do anything to polish up your future Wikipedia entry. Cutting ties with a man who is destructive to our values, profoundly divisive, contemptuous of the rule of law and incontrovertibly unfit to serve in the highest office in the land just might.

Public News Service sees 26-fold spike in donations after its reporter was arrested in West Virginia,"As managing editor of Public News Service (PNS), Lark Corbeil doesn’t spend too many weeks contemplating how to respond to a flood of interview requests from national media outlets. That’s because it’s not every week that one of her reporters gets arrested after posing questions to top Washington officials. “Our staff is just fried,” says Corbeil, referring to the 30-odd employees at PNS, which feeds news stories to 8,000 media outlets nationally, according to the organization. The “donate” function on the group’s website, too, is getting a more vigorous workout. It registered a 26-fold boost in the two-day period after PNS reporter Dan Heyman attempted to get an answer from Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price as to whether domestic violence would be considered a preexisting condition under the Trump-backed American Health Care Act. Don’t get the notion, however, that PNS is preparing a hiring spree with the fresh money. As Corbeil outlines to the Erik Wemple Blog, her organization hauls in between $20 and $30 over a normal two-day period from its donation module. Over the two days after Heyman’s arrest at the West Virginia capital, that two-day number spiked to $775. Huge percentage, small sum. “It’s the largest two-day period ever for us,” says Corbeil, who founded PNS in 1996. “But we’ve got a long way to go to cover all the potential costs” associated with Heyman’s arrest for “willful disruption of governmental processes.” According to authorities, 54-year-old reporter was arrested for his “physical action,” though the complaint in the case alleges that “the defendant was causing a disturbance by yelling questions at Ms. Conway and Secretary Price.” As for Price himself, he has praised the action of the police in the case. Another factor cited by Price is that Heyman was not asking his question in the forum where reporters commonly ask questions. “This gentleman was not in the press conference,” said Price in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt. That comment acquired authoritarian irony in light of Trump’s musing Friday in an interview with Fox News’s Jeanine Pirro that the White House might just dump its daily press briefings altogether. “If Trump has his way now,” says Corbeil, “we won’t have these conferences, so the problem goes away entirely.” That problem being questions. Corbeil & Co. don’t fund PNS exclusively through over-the-transom donations for its roughly $1.1 million annual budget, of course. Most of the money comes from foundations and small nonprofits that support’s PNS’s mission “to support democracy and promote public dialogue in a rapidly changing media environment.” For a taste of what sort of stories that entails, have a look at the group’s homepage — a “die-in” protesting Trumpcare; a report taking issue with Texas abortion laws; an update on a food drive.

Dear Bernie Sanders: Canada is not the United States’ drugstore,"Leona Aglukkaq was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 2008 representing the riding of Nunavut. She served as Canada’s minister of health from 2008 until 2013. Canada has long been a stalwart friend and neighbor to the United States. But there’s one thing Canada must not become: America’s pharmacy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has proposed a bill to let Americans import prescription medicines from Canada. He hopes to this will give Americans access to lower Canadian prices. It’s not just Democrats who like the idea; several prominent Republicans voted in favor of similar legislation that was defeated in January. As someone who spent several years as Canada’s health minister, I know that allowing Americans to purchase prescription drugs from Canada could have terrible consequences for the citizens of both countries. Under Sanders’s plan, Canada would simply serve as an intermediate transshipment point for unapproved drugs heading to the United States. Canadian authorities do not inspect every shipment of products headed for the U.S. marketplace to ensure that packages don’t contain adulterated, counterfeit or illegal drugs. Canada does not have the resources to undertake such comprehensive searches, and the Canadian and U.S. governments are not currently set up to  facilitate such a program. Canada’s health-inspection regime is designed to ensure the safety of medications for Canadians, not for other countries. Absent a major policy shift here in Canada, if bulk Canada-U.S. drug shipments were to become a reality, Americans could receive uncertified, uninspected, third-party drugs. Canada inspects drugs for its own citizens; Canadian authorities wouldn’t have the ability or resources to inspect medicines destined for the United States. What’s more, there’s an opioid epidemic in the United States, and the situation isn’t much better in Canada; British Columbia recently declared a public health emergency to combat the opioid crisis. Because Canada isn’t inspecting all trans-shipped goods bound for the United States, there are dire concerns that international opioid smugglers could disguise their narcotics as prescription drug packages. The amount of fentanyl, much of it from China, reaching Canadian ports has skyrocketed recently. Canadian officials have seized fentanyl packages fraudulently labeled as containing zero grams of the deadly synthetic opioid. This is but one example of a problem that could be exacerbated by Sanders’s proposed legislation. Aside from the fear of counterfeit products being transshipped through Canada to the United States, proponents of importation proposals have overlooked the dangers associated with criminal organizations posing as legitimate online pharmacies. One such victim was Ali Schroer, a family therapist from Denver, who opposes Sanders’s bill after falling victim to counterfeit anti-allergy pills she bought from a Canadian online pharmacy. The drug gave her severe migraines and stomach problems. Schroer points out that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined that 85 percent of the drugs sold by supposedly Canadian pharmacies come from 27 countries other than Canada. Some online pharmacies that advertise as being Canadian in fact are not, and there’s no real way for consumers to know. The difficulty in dealing with online pharmacies has confronted us for years and is only becoming more challenging as e-commerce becomes a larger part of our economy. And that’s not all. Canada’s pharmaceutical industry is already strained trying to serve the relatively small Canadian market, never mind serving more than 300 million American consumers. As the former minister of health for Canada for almost five years, as well as a former minister of health in the Nunavut territorial government before entering federal politics, I am greatly concerned that excess demand from American consumers would siphon off Canada’s domestic supply of essential drugs, particularly for Canadians in remote communities in the north. Canada’s federal health department has introduced regulations requiring drugmakers to report on drug shortages and launched a website called Drug Shortages Canada. These regulations were initiated in response to our own domestic supply challenges to ensure the health and safety of Canadians in terms of their access to important medications. If overnight the Canadian system was stretched to supply the U.S. market, the shortages in Canada could skyrocket. There will clearly be more demand in the years to come for innovative prescription drugs that prolong life, ease suffering and cure disease as the populations of Canada and the United States age. Consequently, there are opportunities for Canada and the United States to cooperate to bring new drugs to market faster, share data and outcomes, and invest in research, development and innovation on both sides of the border. That’s what American legislators should be focusing on — not bulk-buying Canadian medicines. Sanders’s bill threatens Americans’ health and Canada-U.S. relations at a time when there are already trade tensions. Worse, it would reduce the supply of safe and affordable drugs for the Canadian marketplace. American legislators must find another way to address drug prices.

The Health 202: Trump needs to take Health Policy 101,"THE PROGNOSIS It’s been more than two months since President Trump said “nobody knew” health care could be so complicated (see the video above). The president doesn’t seem to have studied up on the topic since then -- despite House Republicans passing a health-care bill. Exhibit A: Trying to follow Trump’s line of logic as he spoke to The Economist about the GOP bill was challenging, to say the least. In the interview published this week, Trump showed that he not only doesn’t understand how health insurance works -- he’s also still unclear on exactly how the House-passed measure would even change the current system. Lawmakers in both parties misspeak about health policy all the time. We get that, to some extent. Since it’s a complex issue, not everyone can be an expert and it’s hard to predict what kind of impact legislation will have on patients, doctors and markets, anyway. Recall how President Obama promised people their insurance premiums would come way down under his health-care law? And supporters of Obamacare dramatically underestimated how costly the marketplace enrollees would be for health insurers, who have been exiting in droves (Aetna, most recently). But Trump has appeared consistently incoherent on the issue in the past few months, as he hounded GOP leaders to get a health-care bill through. Just as the divided House Republican Conference seemed to be working through their differences, he’d fire off tweets promising they’d deliver on certain polices that were still very much up in the air or highlight contentious issues Republicans weren’t eager to discuss. Below are the tweets, for instance, which Trump sent into the universe at the same time Republican leaders were trying to win over moderates for their bill in the House. These moderates -- who were critical to the bill's passage -- feared the bill would create a pathway for some insurers to be able to charge higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions: You can't compare anything to ObamaCare because ObamaCare is dead. Dems want billions to go to Insurance Companies to bail out donors....New ...healthcare plan is on its way. Will have much lower premiums & deductibles while at the same time taking care of pre-existing conditions! Preexisting conditions was one of several health-related topics Trump weighed in on during his Economist sit-down this week -- an interview that motivated The Health 202 to turn today’s Prognosis into one epic fact-checker. Here are five of Trump’s statements that stuck out like a sore thumb: 1. “Our health care is much better than Obamacare…We’re going to have competition, we’re getting rid of the state lines.” The facts: The House bill does not, in fact, allow insurers to sell plans across state lines. It’s a policy conservatives have backed for a long time, and some activist groups are pushing for it to be added to a Senate bill replacing Obamacare. But House GOP leaders didn’t add it to their plan, fearing it would be stripped out under rules governing what can go into a budget reconciliation bill (the vehicle Republicans are using to repeal the Affordable Care Act, requiring just 51 Senate votes instead of the usual 60). 2. “The premiums are going to be low, the deductibles are going to be low.” The facts: Were the House health bill to become law, premiums would almost certainly cost less than under Obamacare, as insurers would be allowed to sell plans with fewer benefits and, in some states, could charge those with preexisting conditions more. --But whether they’d be “low” is another question entirely. Even if premiums are 10 percent lower by 2026, as the Congressional Budget Office has projected, that’s still more money than most people can afford to pay by themselves. 3. “Insurance is, you’re 20 years old, you just graduated from college, and you start paying $15 a month for the rest of your life and by the time you’re 70, and you really need it, you’re still paying the same amount.” The facts: That’s not the way insurance works, unless you regulate insurers (which Republicans generally don’t want to do). Older people pay higher premiums because they cost insurers more. --Bringing premiums for the young and old closer together is actually something envisioned under Obamacare, which allows insurers to charge older folks only three times what they charge younger ones. The Republican health plan would expand that to a five-to-one ratio, allowing insurers to shift more costs onto older people. 4. “Now, Obama[care] has something that’s very, very bad. Where you have to pay a penalty. And people don't realize, how many people are forced to pay a penalty and they don’t get any benefit out of it. We don’t have that. We’re going to have much lower premiums and we’re going to have much lower deductibles.” The facts: One big reason premiums have spiked in many Obamacare marketplaces is because they’ve failed to attract enough healthy, low-cost enrollees. Most economists agree you need an incentive for these types of people to buy plans. --While the House health care plan would eliminate the fine for failing to buy coverage, it still prods people toward buying coverage by allowing insurers to hike their premiums by 30 percent for one year if they don’t maintain continuous coverage. 5. “We have a pool for people that are having difficulty…it’s a high risk pool…we’re putting in $8 billion…and you’re going to have absolute coverage.” The facts: A last-minute amendment to the House health bill indeed adds $8 billion over five years for states to set up pools for people with preexisting conditions, the ones who dramatically increase costs for everyone else. --But will they get “absolute coverage” as Trump said? That’s unclear, considering the bill doesn’t specify who would be eligible for the pools, how much of their costs would be covered or how much they’d be required to pay in premiums. Depending on how many states applied for the $1.6 billion that would be available per year, the funds may be insufficient to keep premiums affordable in these “high risk” pools. Breaking early this morning, our colleagues Sari Horwitz and Matt Zapotosky report that Attorney General Jeff Sessions overturned Obama-era policy regarding drug offenders and instructed his prosecutors to charge such defendants with the most serious"
Trump can’t stop saying things that aren’t true,"President Trump thinks he invented a term “a couple of days ago” that he has been using for months and that economists have for more than a century, and it wasn't even the least accurate thing he said in his latest interview. Now, everyone is understandably laughing at Trump's history of the phrase “priming the pump.” That, of course, is the long-standing idea that the government should fight recessions by cutting taxes and increasing spending. It really entered the lexicon in the 1930s — that's the first time the Economist used the term — but it goes back to at least 1916. Trump, though, has some alternative facts. “Have you heard that expression used before?” he asked the Economist, before explaining that “I haven't heard it ... I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good.” This is puzzling. First off, Trump's question doesn't make any sense on its own terms. How could they have heard of it if he just came up with it? And second, how could he think he just coined it when he used the very words “priming the pump” back in March and December? Who knows. But the bigger point is that Trump doesn't show any more ability to distinguish fact from fan fiction when it comes to his policies, either. He said in the interview, for example, that his health-care plan means that “we're going to have much lower premiums, and we're going to have much lower deductibles.” This is false. The Brookings Institution, for one, estimates that on an apples-to-apples basis — holding the generosity of insurance plans and the age of the insurance pool constant — Trumpcare would actually increase premiums by 13 percent. And the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation says that it would increase the average deductible by $1,550. Not to mention the 24 million people the Congressional Budget Office says would lose coverage mostly as a result of the bill's big cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's subsidies. Trump seems to think that just saying his plan keeps his promises — such as having “insurance for everybody—is the same thing as actually keeping them. It's no different with taxes. Trump has claimed that he will “massively” cut taxes for the middle class"
The Health 202: Here's another huge obstacle to repealing Obamacare in the Senate,"THE PROGNOSIS The Senate is filling in a blueprint for its own Obamacare replacement, but the outer perimeters are already in permanent ink. Speculation abounds over how the Senate will craft a bill chiseling away big pieces from the Affordable Care Act, and how it will differ from the measure the House passed last week. Senators could propose a bill with larger subsidies, for example, or fewer cutbacks to Medicaid, in order to ensure it deprives fewer people of health coverage. Policy-wise, there’s a relatively wide range of possible outcomes for whatever the Senate ends up introducing. But here’s the catch: The Senate bill must achieve the same overall level of savings as the House bill if Republicans want it to have any chance of passing. No Democrats will support the measure, so Republicans moved early on to use arcane budget rules known as reconciliation"" that would allow the health overhaul to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes typically necessary in the Senate. Using reconciliation was a political necessity for Republicans"
What can (or should) activists learn from the tea party?,"The next four years are likely to see a lot of activism on both left and right. Observers and activists have compared the contemporary resistance to President Trump to the tea party movement that opposed President Barack Obama eight years ago. Already, activists on the left have had some success using tea party tactics, turning the repeal of the Affordable Care Act from a presumed certainty into a drawn-out battle. How much more is there to learn from the tea party? We studied the tea party movement as it happened, documenting the movement at its grass roots, in the conservative media, and at the elite levels, and demonstrating how these forces combined to push the Republican Party to the right. Based on our research, here are four lessons that today’s activists might learn from the experience of the tea party. 1. Engage in state elections and party politics. About 900 grass-roots tea party groups were active in 2009 and 2010. Many of these local activists were very politically sophisticated. Tea party groups followed local politics closely, and their members showed up at school boards, town meetings, and state legislature hearings when issues they cared about were up for debate. Even when activists held very inaccurate views of actual policies — for instance, believing that the Affordable Care Act contained “death panels” — they knew how to navigate our political institutions to have a real impact on policymaking. [Why did Trump win? More whites — and fewer blacks — actually voted.] This is particularly relevant for activists on the left, who sometimes suffer from the opposite problem: a high level of policy knowledge with a naive vision of politics. In recent years, Democrats have tended to focus on the federal government and especially the presidency, neglecting the state and local races that have huge effects on whether and how policies get implemented. This is one reason liberals have been losing. After the November elections last year, the Republican Party had control of 32 state legislatures (they had veto-proof majorities in 17 of these) and 33 governorships — an almost unprecedented level of dominance at the state level. Republican state level control limited the impact of the 2008 Democratic wins at the national level. As of Jan. 1, 19 states had chosen not to adopt the Medicaid expansion that would have brought health-care coverage to millions of their citizens. The tea party activists we met had a pragmatic relationship with the Republican Party. Tea party activists were mostly very conservative Republicans, and were often disgusted by their own politicians’ compromises. However, that disgust did not turn tea party members away from the party; instead, it strengthened their motivation to engage in party processes. For example, some tea party activists became precinct captains. Others involved themselves in sleepy local Republican Party meetings and quickly came to dominate those committees. This gave them far more power over local Republican officials than they had as individual voters. Of course, tea party activists were voters, too. Occasionally a tea party-infused Republican primary cost the activists a seat or two, when the Republican candidate was too far out of the mainstream to win in a general election. But tea party activists did not only organize on behalf of ideologically pure conservatives. They were ready to campaign and to vote for candidates, like Scott Brown in Massachusetts, who were far from their ideal legislator but vastly more conservative than their Democratic opponents. What this suggests for activists is that power comes from engaging with the political process at all levels. States’ power will matter in the Trump era on everything from environmental regulation to immigration enforcement. The major political parties are institutions through which activists can assert themselves. 2. Prioritize policies that build power. When the tea party-fueled Republican Party came to power, state legislators focused on priorities that make them more likely to continue to be in power in the future. For instance, 20 Republican-controlled legislatures have passed legislation since 2010 that is likely to lower voting by traditional Democratic constituencies such as young people, African Americans and Latinos. Seven states have passed laws sharply limiting union activity. These measures fit with the symbolic and ideological commitments of the Republican Party, but they are also clever strategic moves. Crippling unions and reducing minority turnout are bad for the Democrats, who rely on these constituencies. Similarly, efforts to defund Planned Parenthood appeal to social conservatives opposed to family planning. They also undercut a powerful player in Democratic Party politics. [This is what Americans will really dislike about the House ‘Trumpcare’ bill] Right-leaning activists are likely to continue in this vein. Democrats could also prioritize policies that will help build political power for the future. These could include voting reforms that ease the registration process, and social policies with benefits that are easier for voters to recognize and therefore easier to campaign on. 3. Use civic experience and invest in building relationships with fellow activists. The most memorable organized actions of tea party activists were their big colorful marches. However, it isn’t marches that make political engagement last in the long term. As Hahrie Han’s research on effective political activism reveals, you cannot just mobilize people for one-off big events and expect to build a movement. Instead, successful movements organize activists in interdependent networks that work together and make decisions together, creating many leaders rather than just a few. This style of organization means investing in personal relationships between activists. At local tea party meetings, there was always time for socializing, so people got to know one another. The demographics of the tea party helped them — they tended to be older people, retirees and small-business people with flexible schedules, and some stay-at-home moms. It also helped that many tea party members had a lot of civic experience to draw from — years of church socials and PTA meetings — so they knew how to organize a meeting, get volunteers signed up for a committee and set up the kind of structures that keep activists engaged over time. The tea party’s lesson here is that not every event should be a march or policy lecture. Social connections are crucial to effective political organization. 4. Look further afield for inspiration. Though the movement substantially shifted the Republican Party rightward, the tactics of the tea party should not be the limit of any activist’s political repertoire. At the grass-roots level, the local tea party groups that were so prominent early in the Obama administration went into decline soon after the 2010 midterm elections. We found that about a third of those local groups had disappeared within a year. But U.S. history does provide examples of civic organizations that lasted not just a few years, but decades, and created tremendous social and political change. There is also a great deal to learn from movements that have not succeeded, such as a national movement for gun control. Activists of all political stripes can and should draw lessons from recent movements, but also the long history of U.S. political organizing.

Another shortcoming of Trumpcare: It punts on delivery reforms,"So far, the health-care debate has focused, as it should, on the extent to which people will be hurt by the replacement bill recently passed by the House. The original Congressional Budget Office score was devastating: 24 million lose health coverage, premiums rise for many older and poorer people, deep cuts are made to Medicaid. And to top it off, many of the spending cuts are transferred to the wealthy in a big, wasteful tax cut. Even so, version No. 1 of that plan wasn’t harsh enough for the hard right. The version that passed last week is worse, as it includes state waivers that will allow insurers to get back in the business of pricing premiums based on people’s medical histories — i.e., ending guaranteed, affordable coverage for preexisting conditions. But even as it’s essential to testify to the draconian nature of the replacement, I want to focus on something else that’s wrong with not just this replacement, but that I fear will also be wrong with whatever comes out of the Senate: They’re going to punt on “bending the cost curve.” That’s an admittedly obscure way of saying they will not build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act to slow the growth of health-care costs. To be clear, they’ll cut spending; specifically, government spending. That’s how they get the money they “need” for their tax cuts. But those spending cuts do not result from squeezing inefficiencies out of the U.S. health-care delivery system. They come from shifting costs onto consumers — i.e., taking us back to the pre-ACA days of lower coverage and less-affordable premiums. First, some evidence regarding health-care costs. The table below shows how health-care price growth has slowed significantly since 2010, and has since been keeping pace with overall price growth. This slowing began before the ACA was in place, so there are other dynamics afoot as well, but projections of national health-care spending have come down significantly since the ACA’s passage. Other important evidence comes from budget forecasts. Between 2010 and 2016, projections of public health spending as a share of GDP declined by four percentage points. The main reason that health care is so much more expensive here than in the rest of the world — they spend about half of what we do, per capita, often with better outcomes — is that we take such a muddled approach to it. On the one hand, and this is big for conservatives, we treat it as a private market good. On the other hand, half the system is public and, unlike an actual market good, hospitals must treat you if you show up at the emergency room. This hybrid doesn’t work very well, in part because of unique characteristics of health care — most of us rarely use the system and we don’t have the knowledge to be informed shoppers. Drug producers, aided by the patent system, gouge the public, even while public dollars help pay for their research. Hospitals and providers are strongly incentivized to emphasize the quantity of care over quality. At least, they were before the ACA. One of Obamacare’s primary goals was to clarify the muddle as best it could, given the fact that it keeps the private-public hybrid in place (yes, other countries keep that hybrid in place, too, but the private side is much more heavily regulated, often through aggressive cost controls). Its main tool in this regard has been a move toward different sorts of payment models, designed to move from fee-for-service to a more bundled approach. These include accountable care organizations, medical “homes” and payment changes that reward outcomes such as lower hospital readmission rates. Although it’s challenging to tie these ideas, aspects of which were in development before the ACA, to the slower price growth noted above, most analysts think they’re in the mix (the evidence re: lower readmission rates looks particularly strong). What will happen if we abandon these still-embryonic efforts and go back to the pre-ACA world? Although providers making progress with bundled payment systems won’t shut them all down, the fact that states can opt out of coverage and pricing mandates in the ACA (if doing so remains allowable in the Senate’s plan) in particular seems awfully likely to thwart the progress we’ve made on cost controls. Moreover, the Republican plans give little thought to the most demanding aspects of health-care spending: chronic diseases. Half of health-care spending is on the 16 percent of folks with chronic illnesses, so this is a critical corner of this debate. Under the ACA, we all pitched in through risk pooling: The healthy subsidized the ill. True, we did so whether we wanted to or not, and that has been a rallying cry of conservatives, whose preferred solution is to pool the chronically ill into inadequately subsidized “high-risk pools.” But what happens when these expensive patients outspend the subsidies, as has been the case in virtually every high-risk pool experiment thus far? Good question, to which there is no good answer. Either sick people come up with the rest of the money, the rest of us do so, or these people go without coverage, an obviously disastrous outcome. My broader point is that thus far, Republicans have revealed two goals: repeal Obamacare and cut taxes for the wealthy. A lot of regular folks risk getting caught up in their crosshairs, and that’s something about which I and my colleagues will continue to raise alarms. But what has flown under the radar is how the Republican plan would also undermine one of the most important motivations for U.S. health-care reform: changing the delivery system so that, year in and year out, we can stop wasting so many percentage points of gross domestic product on inefficient health care.

Morning Bits,"Republicans get nervous. “Republicans in Washington and Georgia acknowledge that a GOP loss in the special election runoff between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff is a distinct possibility, a development that would harden the narrative that Republicans face a daunting task in maintaining control of Congress in 2018. It would also underscore the challenges facing Republicans running in districts Donald Trump either lost or, as is the case in Georgia, barely won.” Cultural anxiety drove white working class voters to  President Trump. “Controlling for other demographic variables, three factors stood out as strong independent predictors of how white working-class people would vote. The first was anxiety about cultural change. Sixty-eight percent of white working-class voters said the American way of life needs to be protected from foreign influence. . . . The second factor was immigration. . . . Finally, 54 percent of white working-class Americans said investing in college education is a risky gamble, including 61 percent of white working-class men. White working-class voters who held this belief were almost twice as likely as their peers to support Trump.” It’s not about economics, but about status. Trump’s tax plan should worry those who think populism is the GOP’s future. “President Trump’s tax cuts would be extremely regressive. The plan gives huge tax cuts to the highest income households and very small tax cuts to the lowest income households. That, combined with President Trump’s budget cuts, would make low-income households worse off, while giving substantial gains (hundreds of thousands of dollars per household) to the very richest families in the country.” No wonder GOP lawmakers are so fearful. “House Republicans, on guard after passing an unpopular healthcare bill that would replace parts of ObamaCare, are seeing their town hall meetings go viral. . . . These moments also are precisely the reason more cautious Republicans are laying low and skipping public events and interviews altogether during the weeklong congressional recess.” The backlash against their all-male health-care group scared the dickens out of Republicans. “Senate healthcare group adds a woman, huddles on Medicaid expansion.” Schools dread these rankings, which force them to drive up the number of applicants — so as to deny more students. “Business-school deans and research faculty at more than 20 universities are taking a stand against the academic rankings published by media outlets such as Bloomberg Businessweek, Nikkei Inc.’s Financial Times and the Economist Group. Rather than ‘acquiesce to methods of comparison we know to be fundamentally misleading,’ the administrators are urging their peers at other schools to stop participating in a process they say rates programs on an overly narrow set of criteria.” Good for them. One more thing for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to agonize over. “President Donald Trump approved plans to directly arm Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State in Syria, U.S. officials said Tuesday, paving the way for an offensive against the extremist group’s de facto capital but angering Turkish allies who view the Kurdish fighters as terrorists.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

Republicans are running from the AHCA,"Some more literally and clumsily than others, Republican lawmakers are running from the House-passed American Health Care Act. Back home, Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) ran away from questioning about the AHCA, Newsweek reports: “On Monday afternoon, the staunchly conservative Republican and member of the House Freedom Caucus fled an interview with Josh Scheinblum, a reporter with TV9 in Dubuque, after Scheinblum had the temerity to ask Blum a series of difficult questions.” Asked why he wanted to exclude those from outside his district from a town hall, Blum got testy: “I don’t represent all Iowans,” Blum countered, still smiling but with a newfound edge to his voice. “I represent the First District of Iowa. That’d be like saying, shouldn’t I be able to, even if I live in Dubuque, go vote in Iowa City during the election because I’d like to vote in that district instead?” A child behind Blum offered a charming grin, likely unrelated to the healthcare debate. [Local reporter Josh] Scheinblum then posed the following question: “Would you still take donations from a Republican in Iowa City?” At this point, Blum rose and began to pull off the microphone attached to his gray pullover sweater. “This is ridiculous,” a visibly agitated Blum declared as he prepared to leave. “He’s just gonna sit here and just, just badger me.” The Cedar Rapids Gazette reported that his town hall didn’t go much better: Rep. Rod Blum, R-Iowa, met a hostile crowd Monday night in his hometown while fielding questions on topics ranging from health care and immigration to school vouchers and climate change. He took the podium to a mix of cheers, boos and applause from a crowd of about 1,000 at Dubuque Senior High School. After an introductory statement, Blum took questions from crowd members selected at random during the town hall event. The two-term incumbent faced regular interruptions from shouted questions, stomping feet and boos when delivering answers in support of last week’s U.S. House bill repealing and replacing major provisions of the federal health care law known as Obamacare. Blum voted in favor of the bill. Even before his vote, Blum was one of the Republicans at risk in 2018. He may be even more vulnerable than initial ratings projected after Monday’s meltdown. By contrast, Republican senators are carefully pivoting from the terms of a bill that they know is without policy or political merit. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), just reelected in Ohio by a huge margin, told Fox News, “I think we can do better by taking what the House has passed, improving it in certain ways, being sure we aren’t pulling the rug out from under people who are currently getting coverage and at the end of the day, over time begin to see these premiums and these co-pays and deductibles level off and not continue to rise.” Obviously, the Trumpcare bill doesn’t help matters. Portman added: “This is the biggest problem we have really in our economy, too. Wages are flat and yet expenses are up and the number one increased cost is healthcare.” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is painting quite a contrast with the feverish, irresponsible process the House went through. “This process will not be quick or simple or easy, but it must be done,” he said on Monday. So why was it then that the House felt so compelled to throw together a bill with no Congressional Budget Office scoring, no robust debate, no hearings and no participation by Democrats? House leadership obviously made a political calculation — pass an indefensible bill and then lie about it. That’s not an option for the Senate, which will be expected to pass something that works. Judging by what Blum encountered, the House approach isn’t working — even on political terms.

The Daily 202: 10 important questions raised by Sally Yates’s testimony on the ‘compromised’ Michael Flynn,"With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Sally Yates’s riveting testimony Monday raised far more questions than it answered. Most of all, it cast fresh doubts on Donald Trump’s judgment. The former acting attorney general disclosed that, 18 days before Michael Flynn resigned, she unambiguously warned White House Counsel Donald McGahn that the national security adviser was “compromised by the Russians” and “could be blackmailed.” Worried about the danger, Yates said she moved with great “urgency.” The FBI interviewed Flynn on Jan. 24th. Yates got a detailed readout on the 25th from the agents who talked with him. Early on the morning of the 26th, she called McGahn and asked to come over to discuss a serious matter that was too sensitive to talk about over the phone. In a secure room, she revealed that Vice President Pence and other White House officials were making false statements to the public regarding Flynn’s conversations in December with Sergey Kislyak. Intercepts reviewed by U.S. intelligence officials showed that the national security adviser had indeed discussed sanctions, despite his repeated public and private denials. Yates explained that “the underlying conduct General Flynn had engaged in was problematic in and of itself,” but she said the bigger worry among senior Justice Department officials was that “the Russians also knew what (he) had done.” “This was a problem because not only did we believe that the Russians knew this, but that they likely had proof of this information,” she told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee. “And that created a compromise situation, a situation where the national security adviser essentially could be blackmailed by the Russians.” The next morning, McGahn phoned Yates and asked her to return. In her telling, the president’s lawyer wondered whether Flynn could and would be prosecuted. He also wanted to see proof. “One of the questions that Mr. McGahn asked me when I went back over the second day was essentially, ‘Why does it matter to DOJ if one White House official lies to another White House official?’” Yates recounted in her testimony. “So we explained to him that … the misrepresentations were getting more and more specific. … Every time that happened, it increased the compromise and, to state the obvious, you don't want your national security advisor compromised with the Russians.” -- Yates’s no-nonsense testimony, delivered with the firmness of someone who spent 27 years at the Justice Department, underscored why the administration and its allies tried to block her from telling her story publicly until now. Devin Nunes canceled a House Intelligence Committee hearing that had been scheduled for last month, and Trump’s team tried to assert executive privilege before backing down under pressure. -- Under oath, noting that she has a senior civil servant from inside the Justice Department’s National Security Division who will back her up as an outside witness, Yates outlined a version of events that is at odds with public statements made by the White House chief of staff. Reince Priebus has tried to downplay what Yates told McGahn. “Our legal counsel got a heads-up from Sally Yates that something wasn’t adding up with his story. And then so our legal department went into a review of the situation,” Priebus said on CBS “Face the Nation” in February. “The legal department came back and said they didn’t see anything wrong with what was actually said.” -- The meetings and phone calls Yates described could have been ripped from a good spy thriller. McGahn asked Yates how Flynn had done during his FBI interview. “I declined to give him an answer to that,” she said. He also told her the White House was concerned that taking action might interfere with the FBI investigation. “And we told him, both the senior career official and I, that he should not be concerned with it,” Yates explained, “In fact, I remember specifically saying, ‘You know it wouldn't really be fair of us to tell you this and then expect you to sit on your hands.’” (Read the full transcript of the three-hour-and-15-minute hearing here.) -- It appeared that there was a great deal more Yates wished she could share, but most of the information surrounding everything that happened remains classified. “Where there is smoke there is not necessarily fire. But there is so much smoke from the Trump-Russia probe that you can’t get near it without a respirator,” Dana Milbank writes in his column. “Monday’s hearing further pumped the bellows.” -- Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) drew parallels to Watergate: “Many years ago, an 18-minute gap transfixed the country and got everybody's attention in another investigation. In this case, we have an 18-day gap between the notification … and action being taken.” -- With congressional inquiries and an FBI investigation ongoing, here are 10 significant and unanswered questions related to this scandal: 1. Did McGahn travel to the Justice Department to review the evidence against Flynn? If so, when? On Jan. 30, Yates let McGahn know that the intelligence he asked for was ready to be reviewed. She got fired that same night for refusing to defend the president’s travel ban. Thus she could not say either way whether the White House counsel ever came to review the material. 2. What exactly did the president know and when did he know it? Sean Spicer said during his briefing on February 14th that, Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House counsel of the situation"
Democrats must unmask Trump’s populist scam. Here’s a place to start.,"THE MORNING PLUM: Now that Senate Republicans are plunging into a protracted, divisive debate over the monstrous House GOP health bill, top Democratic strategists are consumed with a question: How can the party seize on this moment to hold GOP lawmakers accountable in 2018, keep the grass roots engaged, and, more broadly, bring about a period of Democratic renewal? In a new memo to fellow Democrats, two senior Democratic strategists are arguing that the party must highlight the fact that the GOP health bill would not only leave many millions of people stranded without coverage — but, crucially, it would do this while delivering an enormous tax cut to the rich. By highlighting this, the memo argues, Democrats can take advantage of a unique opportunity presented by the GOP health bill. The measure should allow Democrats to unmask Trump’s alleged economic populism as a total scam, and to show that in reality, Trump is furthering a conventionally plutocratic GOP agenda. The memo, which was authored by Dem strategist James Carville and Bridge Project founder David Brock, advises: Trump was elected because he convinced demoralized Americans he would help their circumstances. … Trump lied to all of them … The Republican tax agenda — big cuts for the wealthiest — has never been less popular with voters. But by combining their desires to cut taxes for the wealthiest of Americans in the name of stripping health care away from 26 million Americans, what’s left is toxic for anyone who is facing voters next year. Democrats cannot shy away from bringing that message home, and it has to be made consistently and repeatedly between now and next November… For every single person who stands to lose their health insurance, and every person who is going to pay higher health care bills moving forward, the public needs to know those are direct results of Trumpcare. Simultaneously, we must never lose sight of the contrast at the crux of this legislation — Republicans inflicted all these terrible policies on Americans solely in the name of cutting taxes for millionaires to the tune of nearly $144 billion. As this blog has reported, top Democrats have researched the so-called Obama-Trump voters — people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and switched to Trump in 2016 — and have determined that many of them believe the Democratic Party is in thrall to the wealthy, and Trump isn’t. Thus, driving home the realities of the Trump agenda is an urgent matter, heading into 2018. [Republicans are accidentally paving the way for single-payer health care] The GOP health bill provides an opening to do that, the Carville-Brock memo argues. “Many of the Americans who are likely to suffer most at the hands of the Republican health care bill are the same people who had previously supported Democrats as recently as 2012,” it says. The memo also argues that Democrats “must explain … how our party will do better,” though it doesn’t outline any specific policies Democrats should embrace, instead emphasizing that Democrats need to present themselves as a check on the Trump/GOP plutocratic agenda. “In the coming weeks, we must make sure Americans are fully aware of the disastrous consequences of the Republican bill,” it notes. Bridge Project is also launching digital ads targeting 24 vulnerable House Republicans who voted for the health bill — ads that should be seen as an early effort to establish a template for 2018: Note that the ad’s leading attack is that Trumpcare would gut coverage for millions while cutting taxes for the rich — and that Trump has broken his promise to “take care of everybody.” It points out that Trumpcare would gut protections for people with preexisting conditions — but also that Trumpcare would cut $800 billion from Medicaid. The GOP bill’s provision allowing states to waive the ban on jacked-up premiums for people with preexisting conditions has sucked up much attention. But the bill’s $800 billion in cuts to health spending on the poor, via the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion, combined with its enormous tax cut to the rich, is also a very stark illustration of the true priorities of the Republican Party — and, it turns out, of Trump, too. Throughout the campaign, Trump repeatedly suggested that he supported a robust government role in expanding health care to the poor and sick, and — combined with his vows not to touch Medicare and Medicaid — used this to achieve a patina of ideological heterodoxy that distanced him from Paul Ryan’s GOP, likely helping him win working-class voters. Trump’s embrace of the House GOP bill blows up that scam. But the GOP bill also should blow up the Republican Party’s ongoing scam on this issue. Republicans have employed all sorts of lies and distortions to hide their cruelly regressive health-care designs behind vague suggestions that they actually want everybody to have “access” to coverage, and continue to do so. But the realities of the House GOP bill plainly reveal their true intentions for all to see. [Do high-risk pools work? It depends.] Indeed, it’s a key political tell that Senate Republicans, in their health bill, are expected to soften not just the House GOP’s efforts to gut protections for preexisting conditions but also its massive gutting of the Medicaid expansion to fund a huge tax break for millionaires. Undoubtedly, though, the GOP bill that emerges at the end of this process will retain a good deal of awful, regressive policy. The question is whether Democrats can drive that home to voters, and make sure they remember what House Republicans tried to pull off — and if so, how much all that will matter, given the realities of the tough Senate map and the difficulties in taking back the House. *************************************************************** * GOP CONGRESSMAN GETS PUMMELED AT TOWN HALL: The Post’s Ed O’Keefe reports on a town hall meeting at which GOP Rep. Rod Blum of Iowa, whose district went narrowly for Trump, got hammered over his vote for the GOP health bill. One woman shouted: “You voted on this bill in a rush. … This pertains to my life. This is not how democracy works. … What was the rush?” When the Congressional Budget Office score of the GOP bill does come out, Republicans will have to retroactively explain why they voted for it before getting fully informed of its awfulness. * GOP BILL COULD IMPACT EMPLOYER COVERAGE: Margot Sanger-Katz explains that the GOP health bill’s relaxing of regulations could impact not just the individual market, but employer coverage, too. This is the one to watch: It is possible, through the interaction between the health bill and current regulations, that employers would be able to skirt rules that forbid them from limiting the total amount of health care they will pay for in a year or a worker’s lifetime. A rule capping the amount that a worker can be asked to pay in deductibles and co-payments each year could be similarly vulnerable. Some experts think such outcomes are unlikely. But this underscores how little we know about how much disruption the bill would cause — another way the coming debate will be politically perilous. * MORE BIG RATINGS CHANGES COMING: Last week the Cook Political Report shifted 20 House races toward Democrats in the wake of the GOP health bill. Now the Washington Examiner reports: Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, at the University of Virginia’s Center For Politics, another top elections forecaster, is set to announce Thursday that it is shifting 15 House races toward the Democrats, also with the health care vote in mind. Still, the Examiner also reports that GOP strategists think the health bill won’t be that bad for GOP incumbents, because they say polling is not failing to capture its popularity among GOP voters. * TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBES COULD SPILL INTO NEXT YEAR: CNN reports that there are increasing indications that the FBI and congressional probes into Russian meddling and possible Trump campaign collusion might continue deep into 2018: FBI Director James Comey has given no timeline for the investigation. And there are new signs that congressional investigations into the affair may linger deep into Trump’s term. … A mountain of evidence and partisan disagreement mean it could be 2018 before the job is wrapped up. And even then, hopes are fading that there can be a bipartisan conclusion on the extent of Russian election meddling. The findings will likely get tied up in partisan squabbling as Republicans do all they can to downplay them, but it could make a difference if any serious revelations hit during the 2018 midterms. * REPUBLICANS SPLIT OVER TAX CUTS: Politico reports that Republicans are deeply divided over whether to go for vastly ambitious tax reform or merely just a nifty, lucrative tax cut, which would be a whole lot easier: House Republican tax writers are trying to undercut the case for George W. Bush-style tax cuts, albeit delicately, arguing that would not do much for the economy, at least not compared to a wholesale rewrite. They’re also pointing to the government’s $14 trillion debt while warning that budget rules guarantee that any tax cuts that are not offset will have to be temporary, risking a replay of the years-long battle over the future of the Bush tax cuts. So merely cutting taxes — including on the rich, naturally — wouldn’t actually do much for the economy, and would probably not be offset by tax reforms elsewhere, meaning they would balloon the deficit? Can we get that in writing? * WHAT THE YATES HEARING REVEALED, IN TWO SENTENCES:  Matthew Rosenberg aptly boils down the meaning of Monday’s hearing, where Sally Yates confirmed she warned the White House that Michael Flynn had lied about conversations with the Russian ambassador: Perhaps the biggest takeaway on Monday was that a lot of people had serious concerns about Mr. Flynn serving as national security adviser. But none of them was named Donald J. Trump. Barack Obama, Chris Christie, and Yates — the former acting attorney general — all warned Trump about Flynn. The question is why Trump didn’t fire him until after Yates’s warning was revealed publicly. * ANOTHER BOGUS TRUMP ATTACK ON OBAMA: The White House has been claiming Flynn got security clearance approved during the final months of the Obama administration. But Glenn Kessler looks at the situation and finds it’s mostly a hyped attack: In this case, Flynn’s clearance was a routine matter, said Jim Kudla, a [Defense Intelligence Agency] spokesman. Flynn had left the agency but the practice there is that all former DIA directors should keep a clearance so the current director is able to have a discussion with former directors about classified matters that might require insight from a previous director. What’s more, Flynn did not receive the much higher level of security clearance that would have received scrutiny from top Obama officials. In any case, Obama privately told Trump the had serious misgivings about Flynn.

Maxine Waters: Jeff Sessions believes ‘it’s his job to keep minorities in their place’,"“I think he’s a racist, I think he’s a throwback and I don’t mind saying it, any day of the week.” Oh, I bet you think Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) was talking about President Trump. Nope. In the latest episode of “Cape Up,” the gentlewoman from Los Angeles was unloading on Attorney General Jeff Sessions. LISTEN HERE  For more conversations like this, subscribe to “Cape UP” on Apple Podcasts or Stitcher. “I think that Jeff Sessions is very dangerous … and I think that he absolutely believes that it’s his job to keep minorities in their place,” Waters told me. “And so I think we have to watch him, we have to keep an eye on him, and be prepared to push back.” The 13-term California congresswoman sat down with me in her Capitol Hill office on May 4, just after delivering a speech on the House floor against the Trumpcare bill, but before she had to dash back out to cast her “no” vote. So emphatic is Waters in making her points against the president and the attorney general and, well, everything, that you will hear her finger and ring tapping the desk as she makes each point. Waters became known as “Auntie Maxine” after R. Eric Thomas’s hilarious and brilliantly written review of her blunt, no-nonsense 21-second comments about a briefing with FBI Director James Comey back in January. The title of Thomas’s piece for Elle.com was “Congresswoman Maxine Waters Will Read You Now.” And for 30 minutes, to quote Thomas, Waters continued “reading this town for filth.” [‘Auntie Maxine’ and the quest for impeachment] “I’m so offended by this president that I think it requires me to speak truth to power, to say it like it is and to be as honest as I possibly can about what I think about him being the president of this country,” Waters told me. She believes Trump “colluded with the Russians, with the Kremlin … to undermine our election system and thus undermine our democracy.” “This man has no good values. … He’s indecent,” Waters continued, railing against Trump. “He’s a person that certainly cannot be a role model for our children or for anybody else. The fact that he is the president of the United States is dangerous for us all.” And that’s not all Waters had to say. Listen to the podcast to hear the rest of her take on Trump and Sessions and the whole “Auntie Maxine” craze surrounding her. “I love being called Auntie Maxine,” she said, smiling broadly. “Cape Up” is Jonathan’s weekly podcast talking to key figures behind the news and our culture.

Iowa congressman walks out of a TV interview and into an angry town hall meeting," DUBUQUE, Iowa — An Iowa congressman walked out of a television interview on Monday, declining to explain why his staff is prescreening constituents who plan to attend his town hall meetings this week. A few hours later, Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) showed up at his town hall meeting where most of the prescreened audience screamed at him. It was a rough start to a recess week for Blum, a second-term lawmaker representing a swing district that voted narrowly for President Trump last year after supporting Barack Obama in 2012. Blum is a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who initially declined to support the Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act but ultimately voted last week for the American Health Care Act. The way Blum struggled Monday night to explain his vote — through the loud boos of rowdy, impolite and infuriated constituents — is just a narrow sampling of the the growing concern and confusion caused by Republican plans to revamp the nation’s health-care system. But it indicates the difficult balancing act many Republican lawmakers from swing districts will need to strike as the complex debate continues in Washington. Blum said that the bill had been improved to his liking, but he agreed with constituents upset about the rush to pass it. He called the legislation “Trumpcare” several times during the town hall meeting, but in an interview with The Washington Post called it “Obamacare 2.0″ and admitted that the bill doesn’t repeal the current health-care law. “This isn’t a repeal and replace. This is Obamacare 2.0. We’ve probably changed 10, 20 percent of the bill is all,” he said in the interview. Footage of Blum’s combative television interview aired just before the town hall meeting started. The reporter, Josh Scheinblum, asked Blum about his decision to hold four town hall meetings this week across Iowa’s 1st Congressional District and why his staff was prescreening attendees to ensure they actually lived within the district’s boundaries. “Some would make the case that you represent all Iowans … shouldn’t all Iowans have a voice at the table or at least have the option to?” Scheinblum asked. “I don’t represent all Iowans — I represent the First District of Iowa,” Blum said. “That would be like saying, ‘Shouldn’t I be able to, even though I live in Dubuque, be able to go vote in Iowa City during the election because I’d like to vote in that district instead?’” “Would you still take donations from a Republican in Iowa City?” Scheinblum asked. Blum smiled, stood up and removed his microphone. “This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous. He’s just going to sit here and badger me,” Blum said as he walked away. Scheinblum stayed seated, asking Blum to come and finish the interview. Blum headed for the door and waved him off. “Would I take donations?” Blum said. “Wow.” Blum raised more than $1.8 million during his 2016 reelection campaign. His top two donors were out-of-state entities: A PAC controlled by Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and the conservative Club for Growth. His next three most generous donors were Iowa-based companies, according to Federal Election Commission data reviewed by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. When a constituent later asked Blum whether he would decline to take out-of-district campaign donations if he’s barring out-of-district Iowans from attending his town halls, he demurred. “This is an official event as a congressman, this isn’t a political event — so when we’re talking about contributions coming from outside the district, that’s a political thing,” he told the crowd. That sparked a wave of boos. Blum continued: “The Democrat opponents I’ve ran against the last two cycles have far outraised me both those cycles, and more of their money has come from outside the district than mine.” About 1,000 people showed up Monday night at Dubuque Senior High School to hear from Blum, 62, a former software executive who once coached high school basketball in the gymnasium where he spoke. His son, Taylor Blum, is honored on the walls of the gym for scoring 1,202 points as a member of the basketball team. With his wife and daughter in the audience, people in the prescreened crowd shouted at Blum throughout the evening, complaining that he started late, that he didn’t immediately start answering questions about health care and that he said that his district offices are open and eager to deal with constituent concerns. “You’re never there!” one woman shouted. Eight volunteers checked in constituents as they arrived, while staffers ushered them upstairs to the gym. At least four police officers — including the police chief — stood watch. Blum’s staff banned constituents from waving handwritten posters or campaign signs, so local Democrats distributed red and green sheets of paper. They instructed the audience to hold up the green sheet if they agreed with Blum; the red sheet if they disagreed. Asked about the TV interview, Blum said that he had agreed to be interviewed by KCRG-TV during a visit to the Dubuque Dream Center that assists lower-income, mostly African American children in the city. He added that the station also wanted to interview his wife, Karen, about being a congressional spouse. “Well, we get there and we were ambushed; they didn’t want to do anything on the Dream Center … that became apparent very quickly,” Blum said. “It was very apparent that he had an agenda. It’s my right to say that this interview is over.” Blum defended his decision to hold four town hall meetings this week, noting that other GOP colleagues opt to hold “pop-up town halls” with little notice or small “coffee town halls” with just a handful of supporters. Anticipating detailed questions about the health-care bill, Blum had a copy of the legislation with him on stage plus charts and graphs explaining the changes. “This bill, Trumpcare — whatever you want to call it — is about the individual market only,” he said. “That’s 12,000 people in my district. Twelve thousand people in my district. So if you’re in the group health insurance program through your employers, if you’re getting your insurance through the group health insurance, nothing changes.” “That’s not true! That’s not true!” people screamed from the bleachers, waving the red sheets. “If you’re getting your insurance through Medicare, nothing’s going to change. Nothing’s going to change,” Blum said. “If you’re currently getting your health insurance through Medicaid nothing’s going to –” The crowd drowned him out as he finished his sentence. One woman complained that “You voted on this bill in a rush — there were no committee hearings. This pertains to my life. This is not democracy works and you know that. … What was the rush?” “We did hold hearings,” Blum told her. “I always said the process was bad. It was rushed. It was rushed and there should have been hearings. And we should have had an open amendment process, which we should have. And I was highly verbal about that. I told the president the very same thing — that we should not rush this, we should try to make it bipartisan and try to get Democrats on board.” More red sheets. More boos. Dallas Knapp, 22, a local college senior, had asked Blum about his television interview. He was still shaking off the adrenaline after the event. Local Democrats “are getting more interested and engaged or there’s just people who otherwise weren’t paying attention that are now realizing how important a point in time this is for our politics,” he said. Ruth O’Rourke, a Democrat from nearby Maquoketa, agreed: “His Republican friends stayed home, and I think that was a bad sign for him.” But another woman named Ruth, who declined to give her last name, said she had come to support Blum and was disgusted at the overwhelmingly Democratic crowd. “I feel like I’ve been in a barnyard,” she said, “and that we wasted our congressman’s time.” "
The health bill is a total disaster. That’s why Republicans keep lying about it.,"THE MORNING PLUM: As the political world absorbs the implications of the House GOP vote to repeal and replace Obamacare, it is being widely suggested that the move could put GOP control of the House in jeopardy. There is a long way to go until Election Day 2018, and all kinds of things can change, but there are two indicators right now that this may be shaping up as a legitimate worry for Republicans. First, there’s the energy evident among Democrats, which Republicans themselves are reportedly worried about. Second, there’s the relentless lying and dissembling from Republicans about what the House actually voted for. On the first one: I am told that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is on track to announce sometime this month that it raised $20 million online this year — which would already outpace the entire online haul of the last off-year of 2015. DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly tells me that this online fundraising got a major boost in the 48 hours just after the GOP health-care vote last week, which brought in some $675,000. While it’s true that in the aggregate, the NRCC — the GOP’s House campaign arm — outraised the DCCC overall in the first quarter of 2017, that includes all forms of fundraising. But online fundraising in particular is a useful measure of grass-roots energy; the new numbers show that Democrats are vastly outpacing previous online efforts; and the health-care debate, which figures in many Democratic fundraising appeals, is a key reason. GOP strategists involved in the Georgia House special election cite Democratic enthusiasm as a worrying sign. On the second one: Republicans have fanned across the talk shows to defend the bill, but what they have really revealed is that they can’t defend it without spewing all sorts of lies and distortions about what’s actually in it. A rundown: The bottom line is that Republicans are broadly sidestepping any defense of what their bill actually does. For years, most Republicans argued that the ACA’s individual mandate is snuffing out freedom. Others protested the law’s redistributive features — its taxes on the rich to expand coverage to those with lower incomes; the mandate’s effort to ensure that the young and healthy help subsidize coverage for the sick. It is obviously possible to harbor those objections in a principled fashion. But it is hard to find a Republican who will forthrightly defend the actual projected consequences of the bill’s manner of undoing all of those things. Untold numbers of people with preexisting conditions will be more vulnerable to losing coverage, financial ruin and, in certain cases, possibly death. Millions of lower-income people will lose coverage. Instead of arguing that these things are worth the trade-off of doing away with the mandate and the high-end taxes, Republicans who support the bill continue to deny that those things will happen at all, in the face of all evidence and expert analysis to the contrary. It’s hard to say how much all this will matter for the 2018 elections. As Ross Douthat points out, the Senate version could end up restoring much of the funding that the House GOP bill slashes, making it look less like a naked plutocratic exercise in gutting coverage for poor people to put money back in the pockets of the rich, softening it politically. Still, now that the Senate is taking up health care, we will be debating this for months to come, and that might make the realities of the bill House Republicans did vote for harder for them to escape. ********************************************************************* * NEW AD CAMPAIGN BLASTS REPUBLICANS ON HEALTH CARE: Save My Care, an advocacy organization defending the Affordable Care Act, today is launching a new, six-figure ad campaign blasting 24 House Republicans who voted for the GOP repeal bill. Here is the version of the spot targeting Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.): It slams her for voting to raise premiums, to cut health coverage for millions and to strip away protections for people with preexisting conditions. Last line: “Congresswoman McSally: How could you do this to us?” * VULNERABLE REPUBLICANS MAY FACE ANGRY CONSTITUENTS: NBC News’s Alex Seitz-Wald talks to voters in the Miami suburban district of GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who voted for the bill and may be one of the most vulnerable of all House Republicans. Summary: Almost two dozen interviews with voters … reveal a mix of opinions on his vote … But the voters with the most passionate responses were generally those who opposed the Republican plan and their representative’s support for it. As one opponent put it: “I have never canvassed before, but I will f—ing crawl door to door to make sure you lose.” That level of energy is what Republicans need to worry about. * KASICH SLAMS GOP HEALTH BILL: On CNN’s “State of the Union,” Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) suggested that the GOP health bill would kick untold numbers off Medicaid and asserted that he would not seek the GOP bill’s state waiver for the ban for insurers on jacking up premiums for preexisting conditions. He said its “high-risk pools” are “not funded” and are “ridiculous.” This is another sign that GOP governors who represent Medicaid expansion states are going to be very critical of any GOP bill that guts it. It also shows that the GOP bill, by giving them the option of trying to relax regulations for insurers, would put them in a very tough political spot. * REPUBLICANS FEAR LOSS IN GEORGIA: McClatchy reports that Republicans are now seriously pondering the possibility that Democrat Jon Ossoff could beat Karen Handel in the special election for a House seat in the Atlanta suburbs: [A loss] would harden the narrative that Republicans face a daunting task in maintaining control of Congress in 2018. It would also underscore the challenges facing Republicans running in districts Donald Trump either lost or, as is the case in Georgia, barely won … interviews with a half-dozen Republican operatives and strategists familiar with the race reveal a recognition that Democrats have enthusiasm on their side. But keep in mind that this is still a Republican district: Tom Price, who is now HHS secretary, won it by more than 20 points in 2016. * TRUMP SHAKEUP OF EPA CONTINUES: The Post’s Juliet Eilperin reports that EPA chief Scott Pruitt has decided to replace half of the officials on a review board that judges the agency’s scientific research. This is part of a broader shift: Pruitt is planning a much broader overhaul of how the agency conducts its scientific analysis, said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations … The agency may consider industry scientific experts for some of the board positions, Freire said, as long as these appointments do not pose a conflict of interest. A climate skeptic leads the EPA and may replace key scientific review positions with industry experts. What could go wrong? * MACRON WON — BUT WARNING SIGNS PERSIST: E.J. Dionne Jr. writes that Emmanuel Macron’s defeat of Marine Le Pen represented an important reassertion of pluralist liberal democracy in the face of the nationalist threat, but it’s not all reassuring: Macron ran as a confident and unflinching advocate of pluralism and openness, and he will become, instantly, a major global voice for those values. But he will have to govern a deeply torn nation in a surly mood. Le Pen’s share of the vote … was still a major breakthrough for what had once been a pariah party long dismissed as a neofascist movement rooted in unsavory aspects of French history. Like Trump, Le Pen rallied voters in once prosperous but now ailing industrial towns. Meanwhile, Nate Silver notes an interesting trend: This represented the latest example of the nationalist candidate under-performing the public opinion surveys. * GOP BILL IS ‘AN ACT OF DELIBERATE BETRAYAL’: Paul Krugman runs through all the promises the GOP health bill would break (by leading to higher premiums; widespread loss of coverage; and gutted protections for the sick) and concludes: This isn’t one of those cases where people try to do what they said they would, but fall short in the execution. This is an act of deliberate betrayal: Everything about Trumpcare is specifically designed to do exactly the opposite of what Trump, Paul Ryan and other Republicans said it would. After all, if your goal is to gut coverage for millions of poor people while giving the rich an enormous tax cut, you can’t really say that out loud.

GOP grownups debunk fake AHCA defenses,"At times House Republicans and administration officials sound absolutely daft when defending the American Health Care Act they narrowly passed last week. Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) will surely appear in most every Democratic ad in 2018 thanks to his nonsensical assertion at a town hall. “Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care,” he (actually) said. That was the most laughable but certainly not the only ridiculous assertion by Republicans who seem willing to employ any argument, no matter how implausible or flat-out wrong to justify their vote. Consider this exchange on ABC’s “This Week.” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) insisted Republicans were getting rid of job-killing taxes. It went downhill from there: STEPHANOPOULOS: But most of benefits go to millionaires. RYAN: Medicaid — it’s — we’re repealing all of the Obamacare taxes. But the Medicaid, what we’re doing with Medicaid, we’re giving the states the ability to customize Medicaid to meet the particular needs of their vulnerable populations. You’ve got to remember, Medicaid is a program that is administered by the states, but micromanaged by the federal government, and not very well. More and more doctors are refusing to even accept people with Medicaid. And so we want to give the states the ability to customize the Medicaid program to work for their particular states. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But you’re saying they can do that with $880 billion less. You’re saying they can do it with $880 billion less. RYAN: We’re — we’re giving states the ability to run their own Medicaid program. And it is increasing for medical inflation. And by the way, we recognize that for certain people in Medicaid, the disabled, the aged, the people in nursing homes, we’re giving them a bigger increase so that their funds are even more than everybody else. And so by giving states the right to run Medicaid, and giving them a block grant, per capita bloc grant, or a bloc grant, and then increasing that the spending by medical inflation, I hardly think that’s draconian. STEPHANOPOULOS: So, you don’t think anyone will be hurt when you’re taking $880 billion out of the system? RYAN: No, no, I don’t, because I think the micro-management of Medicaid by the federal government. The Medicaid system isn’t working. Doctors aren’t taking Medicaid, hospitals can’t survive with Medicaid alone. Does anyone really believe that depleting Medicaid by $880 billion will improve reimbursement rates or coverage — especially when the GOP plan explicitly rolls back Medicaid expansion? Both Ryan and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price insisted on the Sunday shows that no one with a preexisting condition would lack coverage. That’s false given that states were given the right to opt out of protection for preexisting coverage and the high-risk pools are underfunded by hundreds of billions of dollars. Price continues to dissemble on key aspects of his plan. The Post’s Glenn Kessler explains: Price flatly stated that Medicaid spending will go up year after year in the budget, but that’s false. It actually declines in raw dollars after the switch in funding is implemented. Although HHS suggests he was saying that spending would go up by the rate set in the law, that’s still misleading. That’s a fixed amount untethered to the actual expenses of patients, so if the money falls short, states will either have to make up the difference or cut expenses by limiting enrollment or reimbursements. Price is similarly misleading when he declares that 20 million people have rejected the Affordable Care Act by paying a penalty. … In fact, the number of people paying a penalty actually declined by nearly 20 percent from 2014 to 2015, indicating greater acceptance of Obamacare. Perhaps Ryan and Price should listen to a GOP governor who will have to deal with the consequences of their legislative malpractice. Ohio Gov. John Kasich blasted Republicans for dissembling. (“This bill … is woefully inadequate and very disappointing,” he said during a stop on his book tour in California over the weekend. “Put yourself in somebody else’s shoes — how you would like to not be able to get health insurance because you have a preexisting condition, or you’re sick or you don’t have money?”) Contrast Ryan and Price’s rank dishonesty and spin with the calm, factual analysis Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) provided Americans: “It’s difficult to assess the new House bill because we still don’t have a CBO analysis of the impact of coverage and costs.” The conversation continued: COLLINS: Well, first of all, one of the problems with the House bill is that the tax credits are not adjusted for income or geographic region. That really hurts a state like Maine, where we have an older population living in largely more expensive, rural areas, as far as health care is concerned. I’ve heard a lot of talk about the Maine high-risk pool. And indeed, it was a success in Maine for the 18 months or so in which it operated before the passage of the ACA and it can be part of the solution. But in Maine, we had definite revenue streams supporting the high-risk pool, and that is why it worked. In the House bill, it’s really up to the states to come up with whatever option they wish. So that could work and it could be part of a solution. But the devil really is in the details. STEPHANOPOULOS: So do you agree with the Speaker Ryan and President Trump who are saying people with preexisting conditions are going have the same coverage they have now, even better, Speaker Ryan said, in some cases, letters of protection, than under Obamacare? COLLINS: I think that’s unlikely. But so much discretion is given to the states without any guardrails. The difference between that approach and the approach in the bill that Senator Cassidy and I have introduced is we keep the ACA safeguards, the consumer protections, for people with preexisting conditions. It’s true that under the House bill that a state that gets a waiver would still have to provide coverage to people with preexisting conditions. But that coverage might well be unaffordable. And if the coverage is unaffordable, that doesn’t do any good for a child who has juvenile diabetes and is going have that her entire life. And once she’s no longer on her parents’ policy, that’s going to create problems in some states. House Republicans have been so fixated on passing anything that they now find it hard to defend their handiwork without resort to exaggeration, deflection and flat-out dishonesty. There is a surefire way to tell they are not accurately representing the bill: Fellow GOP senators want no part of it.

"In Texas, almost all non-voters have a photo ID — but few understand the voter identification rules","Over the past 12 years nearly 20 U.S. states have adopted voter photo identification laws, which require voters to show a picture ID to vote. These laws have been challenged in numerous lawsuits, resulting in a variety of court decisions and, in several instances, revised legislation. Supporters argue that photo ID rules are necessary to safeguard the sanctity and legitimacy of the voting process by preventing people from impersonating other voters. They say that essentially every U.S. citizen possesses an acceptable photo ID, or can relatively easily get one. Opponents argue that that’s not true; that laws requiring voters to show photo ID disenfranchise registered voters who don’t have the accepted forms of photo ID and can’t get one easily. Further, they say, these laws confuse some registered voters, who therefore don’t bother to vote at all. Opponents also point out that there are almost no documented cases of voter impersonation fraud. Supporters counter that without a photo ID requirement, we have no idea how much fraud there might be. [This is what Americans will really dislike about the new House ‘Trumpcare’ bill] We conducted surveys in Texas this year to investigate these arguments. Our study found that virtually all eligible non-voters — that is, people who could have but didn’t vote — possessed a valid photo ID. But not many really understood the photo ID regulations. How did voter ID laws affect turnout? November 2016 was Texas’s second general election with photo ID rules in force. Through the University of Houston Hobby School of Public Affairs, in February and early March we surveyed a representative sample of Texans who were registered to vote but did not (let’s call them non-voters) in the state’s two highest-profile battlegrounds. In Harris County (population: 4.6 million), which includes Houston, 39 percent of the registered voters did not cast ballots. And in West Texas’s 23rd Congressional District (CD-23), where incumbent Republican Will Hurd won by only 3,051 votes in a hard-fought campaign, 45 percent of registered voters did not go to the polls. The surveys were in English and Spanish. We were particularly interested in whether non-voters stayed home in part because they didn’t understand what ID they were supposed to show. In 2016, voters who possessed one of the seven state-approved forms of photo ID (either unexpired or which had expired in the prior four years) were required to provide it, but voters who didn’t possess one could vote as long as they filled out a declaration explaining why and presented one of several non-photo supporting documents, ranging from a voter registration certificate to a utility bill. Photo ID was not required to cast a mail ballot, but no-excuse absentee voting in Texas is limited almost exclusively to those 65 and older. In our surveys, we asked respondents if they had an up-to-date (i.e., not expired) form of each of the state-approved photo IDs that could be used to vote in person. Altogether, 97 percent of registered non-voters in Harris County and 98 percent in CD-23 said they had at least one. When the definition of an acceptable ID is expanded to include state-approved IDs that had expired within the previous four years, the proportion of non-voters with an acceptable form of photo ID rose to 99 percent in Harris County and remained at 98 percent in CD-23. Almost everyone had a photo ID. Few understood the rules. But while almost everyone had a photo ID, very few understood what the rules were. The survey asked our non-voters to listen to three statements and tell us which one most accurately described Texas’s photo ID requirements for voting in November 2016. Only one in five picked the right statement: 21 percent in Harris County and 18 percent in CD-23. [Want to change Congress? Change who votes in ‘safe’ district primaries] Three out of five non-voters in both jurisdictions (58 percent and 60 percent) believed — wrongly — that all voters had to show a state-approved photo ID to vote in person. That wasn’t true. In fact, people with no photo ID could still vote as long as they signed an affidavit and showed one of several supporting documents, such as a bank statement, government check, paycheck, utility bill or voter registration certificate. What’s more, three out of four Harris County (74 percent) and CD-23 (75 percent) non-voters wrongly believed only an unexpired Texas driver’s license (the most common form of photo ID held by Texans) could be used to vote in person. Only one in seven non-voters in Harris County and CD-23 knew that in 2016, you could still use your license for four years after it expired. Latinos were least likely to understand the photo ID rules Overall, Latinos were significantly less likely to understand the rules than were other group. In both places, only 15 percent of Latino non-voters understood the photo ID rule, in contrast to 24 percent of Anglos and 28 percent of African Americans in Harris County. (CD-23 doesn’t have enough African American non-voters for a statistically valid sample.) Latinos also were significantly more likely to say the photo ID rules were more restrictive than they actually were. Virtually all registered non-voters owned a photo ID that would have enabled them to vote. And yet 17 percent of non-voters in Harris County and 15 percent in CD-23 said they did not vote in part because they did not have the right ID. However, less than 2 percent said this was the “principal” reason they did not vote. Did misunderstandings about the voter ID regulations suppress turnout? Our survey is unable to determine that. But it’s noteworthy that so many Texas non-voters were confused about the rules. That conclusion is bolstered by a parallel survey we conducted in Harris County in December among registered voters who did vote in November 2016. Just two in five voters (40 percent) could accurately identify the photo ID rules, and a majority (56 percent) believed — wrongly — that all voters had to show a state approved photo ID to vote in person. Much as we found among non-voters, Latino voters (26 percent) were significantly less likely than Anglo (49 percent) and African American (39 percent) voters to know the rules — and they were significantly more likely to believe the rules were more restrictive than they actually were. Whatever the merits or faults of photo ID laws, clearly most Texans don’t understand the rules very well.

Morning Bits," The Trumps are leading us into the realm of banana republics. “President Trump’s son, Eric, once told a golf writer that funding for Trump golf courses come from Russia, that writer recounted in a new interview.” Well isn’t that a leading question? “When there’s a federal investigation of a network and the network’s head honcho is hanging out with the president, does it look inappropriate and is it inappropriate?” He is leading people down the garden path. “House Speaker Paul Ryan insists a bill the House passed to repeal and replace Barack Obama’s health care law provides sufficient coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. Ryan says the House measure gives states flexibility to set up high-risk pools for the very sick so that no one is denied coverage.” He’s becoming the leading light for #NeverTrump governance. “Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Sunday knocked the Republican health care bill as inadequate, arguing the just-passed House measure would leave many Medicaid patients and those with pre-existing conditions wanting.” Let’s hope France is a leading indicator. “The populist wave crashing across the world has come to a halt in France, as centrist Emmanuel Macron fended off right-wing populist Marine Le Pen to become the next president of France.” And the margin was huge. For years, trade demagogues have been leading an uninformed public around by the nose. “You also know you’re being deceived when a politician talks only about the gains to domestic producers (like US steel producers) who are protected from foreign competition through tariffs and other trade policies, without a word about all of the losses incurred by the many other domestic producers who use imports like steel as inputs, and the American workers for those producers, and the US consumers who buy products from those producers.” So far Trump’s North Korea policy isn’t leading to better results. “North Korea has detained another American who worked at a private university in Pyongyang, taking to four the number of U.S. citizens being held by Kim Jong Un’s regime.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

Keeping my kids with diabetes alive costs thousands a year. Trumpcare terrifies me.,"Last week, the House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act, which would cut Medicaid considerably and allow insurance companies to charge people with preexisting conditions significantly more for coverage. As a mom of four kids — two with Type 1 diabetes, an unpreventable, incurable and expensive disease — I am terrified that this bill will put my children’s lives at risk if it becomes law. I will never forget that day in 2012 when our doctor told me and my husband our 2-year-old son had diabetes. At first, we were frightened for his health and future. We knew that if the disease wasn’t managed correctly with the right diet, dosage of insulin and vigilant care, he could not only get very sick, not only potentially lose his sight or a limb — but he could die. We were devastated all over again when our almost-3-year-old daughter also was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes earlier this year. The medications, the insulin pumps and the glucose monitors our son and daughter rely on are necessities. Having them is literally a matter of life and death. [Why treating diabetes keeps getting more expensive] That is why the AHCA worries us so much. I am self-employed, and my husband does not receive insurance through his employer. Our family relies on an HMO plan we purchased on the D.C. “Obamacare” exchange. It costs us about $18,000 a year to insure our family. Even with this coverage, we still spend about another thousand more on health care. The diabetes supplies alone for our two kids cost about $12,000 a year — and, again, we can’t simply look for cheaper options or do without some supplies without seriously jeopardizing their health. When our insurance refused to cover the long-acting insulin my little girl used right after she was diagnosed, we were forced to borrow some from our friends who had extra so we could stabilize her for a month. Then, we had to quickly put her on an insulin pump, which our insurance thankfully did cover, and switch her to the short-acting insulin allowed by our plan. The other reality families of diabetes patients have to deal with is that at some point, a trip to the emergency room is inevitable. Twice last year, for instance, our son, sick with a stomach bug, went to the hospital with potentially life-threatening dehydration, which resulted from the dangerous and rare combination of high ketones and low blood sugar — a combination that could put him in a coma and can only be treated in the hospital. The ER co-pay cost us $300 each time. It’s not a small sum, but with our insurance, thankfully, it was all we had to pay. Our plan isn’t perfect, and our premiums could go up by nearly a third next year. But that’s still better than what would happen if the AHCA becomes law. My two kids with diabetes would probably become uninsurable on the individual and small-group market, just as patients with preexisting conditions were before Obamacare. One trip to the ER would be financially devastating. Just paying for the pumps, monitors and insulin that keep our kids alive would saddle us with an enormous financial burden, one we might not be able to overcome. [Should healthy people have to pay for chronic illnesses?] We aren’t alone, either. According to the Type 1 diabetes advocacy group JDRF, 1.25 million Americans have the disease, and all of them have to worry about being charged more or kicked off insurance for it, too. If premiums rise, many patients won’t be able to afford the pumps and blood glucose monitors like my kids wear — devices that have been lifesavers, multiple times over, and help to prevent serious complications. Instead, children with diabetes will be discriminated against for an illness that’s completely out of their control. I am not a politician or a health-care expert. But as a mother, an American and a human being, I know that taking affordable health care away from kids with diabetes — or any chronic disease — is just wrong. My husband and I have joked about what country we’d have to move to if the AHCA passes. It’s sad that we even have to discuss it. For my kids and the hundreds of thousands like them, I am going to do everything I can to make sure this bad bill doesn’t become law. Read more: My son has a preexisting condition. It’s one of the reasons I voted for the AHCA. People think juice is good for them. They’re wrong.

The High-Risk Pool,"The American Health Care Act that passed the House provides for the sorting of people with preexisting conditions into “high-risk pools.” Historically these have not worked, providing extremely limited benefits at a very high cost. And the AHCA allots a comically small $8 billion to help fund such pools, meaning that vulnerable people who need coverage are likely to be left stranded. With apologies to Shirley Jackson. The morning of the drawing dawned bright and clear, with the fresh warmth of a full summer day. The flowers blossomed profusely and the grass was lushly green, like a fresh 20-dollar bill. Old Mr. Paulson had once held a 20-dollar bill before he had discovered something wrong with his heart and been placed here with the others with Conditions; it had smelled like a kale chip. There was activity all around. When the Van pulled into the town square everyone felt a surge of excitement, as if the air held an electric charge. The children assembled first, of course, the ones who were mobile enough. They shoved and laughed and started gathering stones. Annie Cenotaph suggested that they play doctor and they gravely formed a line in front of her and she turned them away one by one on the grounds of a scraped knee or a scabbed elbow and everyone giggled so loudly that Mrs. Cenotaph had to come out of her house and tell them to hush. They did not speak directly of the thing that was going to take place, but little Katie Hinkle had made a pretend IV out of some grass and attached it to her arm, bouncing with excitement. She contributed two small stones to the pile and then sat down for a long time to catch her breath. The crowd assembled slowly. It had been many years since a drawing had taken place and everyone spoke in hushed, reverent tones. Even the teenagers stood quietly in the back, trying not to wheeze too noticeably at the pollen. The pool was conducted by Mr. Ryan, who had inherited the function of determining who was to be singled out for the Conferring of Benefits from his father or grandfather or great-grandfather or some even more remote ancestor. He arrived soon enough, carrying the black box from which the pool was traditionally conducted, and then everyone assembled around him in the middle of the town square, between the library and the bank and the CVS 30-second clinic. He began the tedious work of listing the names of heads of households and families and filling the box with the paper slips that had replaced the plastic cards of years prior, nodding politely at the women and joking with the few men. The town, except for the graveyard, was smaller than it had been, and the drawings seemed to be fewer and farther between than they had been, too. Very few people were still there who had been present for the last one. Tess Hutchinson, visibly pregnant, came running late through the crowd from her double shift at work. She pushed through the crowd to take her position behind her husband a few moments before the drawing was due to begin. But there was no sign of him. “Kevin?” she called. “Kevin?” “Given your condition, he’s opting to enter the market as an individual,” her neighbor Kathy Delacroix explained. “Said his odds were better. I thought you knew.” The origins of the tradition had been lost in time, but the idea that it was somehow American and Market-Based and that Limits Had To Be Put On These Things had managed to seep down through the years. Mr. Ryan finished his fussing, produced the traditional celebratory Bud Light, cracked it open, then squared his shoulders and turned to the crowd. “Anyone missing?” “Several,” came the murmur from the crowd. Dunbar and Banner and Hupp were all bedridden and could not be stirred. Provisions were made for others to draw on their behalf. Then Mr. Ryan said they had better start so it would be over by dinner time. “Remember,” Mr. Ryan intoned, “don’t unfold it until everyone has taken theirs.” He called them up by name. One by one, a member from each family went up to the black wooden box and withdrew a slip. Atkins. (“Obesity,” the crowd murmured.) Baker. (“Pregnancy,” came the whisper.) Marvin. (“Heart defect.”) Paulson. “You know,” Tess whispered, “I hear in Canada they don’t do it like this.” “Shh,” Mr. Ryan said, sharply. “Tess, this is America,” Kathy said, wiping her sweating palms on her apron. “We reward industry and toil and people who make responsible choices, like being born with money or without a chronic health condition.” A big dirigible full of rich people with gleaming white teeth whooshed by overhead, tossing spare kidneys from the window, interrupting the lazy murmur of Mr. Ryan’s voice calling the names. “Being born like that is not a choice,” Tess said. Kathy elbowed her in the ribs, then winced. Her bursitis was excruciatingly painful and she had been unable to afford treatment, even though she had put together what she thought was a very compelling GoFundMe campaign for it. “High-risk pool,” Mrs. Cenotaph said, “high-reward pool. That’s what they always say.” “It’s patriotic.” “We all take the same chance.” They all waited patiently, and then Mr. Ryan said, “Now, fellows!” and there was a great rustling. “Who’s got it?” voices asked. “Who’s got it?” Little Katie Hinkle tugged at her mother’s sleeve in excitement, but their paper had nothing on it but the usual black spot. Finally a murmuring began, “It’s Hank Mill! Mill’s got it!” and Mill stepped to the front of the group with a beaming smile. Mr. Ryan handed him an insurance card and he climbed into the waiting van to go get his prostate looked at. The stones were for everyone else, if they got sick of hoping.

The King’s English,"Sometimes, commentary is hardly necessary — the words speak for themselves. Verbum ipsa loquitur. Here, unedited — posted, appallingly enough, at the official White House website — are the remarks by the leader of the free world on the occasion of the House’s passage of the the Trumpcare bill: And I will say this, that as far as I’m concerned, your premiums, they’re going to start to come down.  We’re going to get this passed through the Senate.  I feel so confident.  Your deductibles, when it comes to deductibles, they were so ridiculous that nobody got to use their current plan — this nonexistent plan that I heard so many wonderful things about over the last three or four days.  After that, I mean, it’s — I don’t think you’re going to hear so much.  Right now, the insurance companies are fleeing.  It’s been a catastrophe.  And this is a great plan.  I actually think it will get even better.  And this is, make no mistake, this is a repeal and replace of Obamacare.  Make no mistake about it.  Make no mistake.  (Applause.) And I think, most importantly, yes, premiums will be coming down.  Yes, deductibles will be coming down.  But very importantly, it’s a great plan.  And ultimately, that’s what it’s all about. We knew that wasn’t going to work.  I predicted it a long time ago.  I said, it’s failing.  And now, it’s obvious that it’s failing.  It’s dead.  It’s essentially dead.  If we don’t pay lots of ransom money over to the insurance companies it would die immediately. So what we have is something very, very incredibly well-crafted.  Tell you what, there is a lot of talent standing behind me.  An unbelievable amount of talent, that I can tell you.  I mean it.  (Applause.)  And coming from a different world and only being a politician for a short period of time — how am I doing?  Am I doing okay?  I’m President.  Hey, I’m President.  Can you believe it?  Right?  (Applause.)  I don’t know, it’s — I thought you needed a little bit more time.  They always told me, more time.  But we didn’t. But we have an amazing group of people standing behind me.  They worked so hard and they worked so long.  And when I said, let’s do this, let’s go out, just short little shots for each one of us and let’s say how good this plan is — we don’t have to talk about this unbelievable victory — wasn’t it unbelievable?  So we don’t have to say it again.  But it’s going to be an unbelievable victory, actually, when we get it through the Senate. And there’s so much spirit there.  But I said, let’s go out — we have a little list of some of the people — and I think after that list goes, if they don’t talk too long, our first list, we’re going to let some of the other folks just come up and say whatever you want. But we want to brag about the plan, because this plan really — uh oh.  (Laughter.)  Well, we may.  (Laughter.)  But we’re just going to talk a little bit about the plan, how good it is, some of the great features. [He then continued for a bit, though he never did get to talking about all of those “great features. Italics added.] I’m sorry"
"House GOP cheers health-care vote, ignores iceberg dead ahead","Congratulations, House Republicans! You did it. After seven years and more than five dozen failed votes, you finally passed a bill to repeal Obamacare. And by doing so, you handed President Trump something he so desperately wanted: a victory. The president was so excited that he blew up his schedule so that he could fete the GOP members in the Rose Garden. By all the back-slapping and cheering, you’d think it was the final touchdown in the last second of the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl instead of the end of the first quarter that it really is. Here’s a little reality checkup. The controversial measure has only passed the House. It now goes to the Senate, where the prospects are not good. Before the House vote, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted his concern. A bill — finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate — should be viewed with caution. — Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) May 4, 2017  Adding to the drama is the need to get 60 votes just to close debate on whatever the Senate comes up with. That means the 52-seat Republican majority is going to have to give something, lots of things, to Democrats just to get to 60. Lord knows what will happen once they have to vote for the actual measure. Exhausted yet? Well, it’s not over. That Senate bill — assuming they do one and pass it — will look completely different from the original House bill. The fight to reconcile the two versions and get a final bill passed on Trump’s desk promises to be epic. Democrats and advocacy groups will be fully mobilized to try to pull the plug on Trumpcare. [‘The budget from hell’ and raising the debt ceiling: Republicans are not ready for the drama] And on top of all of this — Congress must negotiate and pass a federal budget for 2018 AND raise the debt ceiling. Both must be done by the end of September or there will be a government shutdown, or the government will shut down because the economy collapsed due to a U.S. default on payments. Knowing that, it makes the celebration at the Rose Garden seem like the carefree hours before the Titanic hit that iceberg. So, enjoy the celebration, folks, ’cause it might be the only one you’ll be having for a while.

These Republicans may be throwing their seats away,"Whatever you think of the American Health Care Act on the merits, political watchers across the spectrum see a significant downside for Republicans who voted for the AHCA. Activists and groups on the left, like the Daily Kos, figure: Of the 23 members who hold districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, 14 Republicans voted for the bill, as did another 10 of those whose seats Trump won with less than 50 percent (excluding districts in Utah, where conservative independent Evan McMullin drew substantially from Republicans). Democrats need to gain exactly 24 Republican-held seats while defending all 194 of their own to capture control of the House in 2018, and these 24 Trumpcare supporters will likely be prime targets. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report shows six Republicans, including the Georgia 6th District seat, in the “toss up” category and 18 in the “lean Republican” column. In the “likely Republican” column are 19 more names, including 14 who voted for the bill. Add in the likely pickup for the Democrats of the seat held by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.) — who is retiring from a district Hillary Clinton won by nearly 20 points — and you had 44 of the best potential Democratic pickups. [How the House voted to pass the GOP health-care bill] In that batch of 44 seats, only Ros-Lehtinen, two of the tossups, three in the lean-GOP group and four in the likely-GOP group voted against the bill. In short, a surprisingly few number of Republicans in at-risk seats (10) chose to save themselves with a “no” vote on the AHCA. With 24 seats needed for the Democrats to take back the House (23 if Jon Ossoff wins in Georgia) you see a very plausible path for the Democrats to take back the majority. Moreover, even among the 10 who voted “no,” Democrats will likely win Ros-Lehtinen’s seat and have a shot at the other nine. How did the map get so treacherous? With the health-care vote: Not only did dozens of Republicans in marginal districts just hitch their names to an unpopular piece of legislation, Democrats just received another valuable candidate recruitment tool. In fact, Democrats aren’t so much recruiting candidates as they are overwhelmed by a deluge of eager newcomers, including doctors and veterans in traditionally red seats who have no political record for the GOP to attack — almost a mirror image of 2010. … In light of the vote, we are shifting our ratings in 20 districts, all reflecting enhanced opportunities for Democrats. The major caveat is that 18 months is an eternity in politics and that as always, we will continue to adjust our outlook as events unfold and the landscape develops. The health-care vote is already taking its toll in other ways, as the Atlantic pointed out: In its pitch for donations, the liberal website Daily Kos argues that a surge in donations “would both terrify Republicans and boost Democratic efforts to recruit good candidates … [and] help us defeat these Republicans next year.” The appeal directs readers to an ActBlue page raising money that will be earmarked for future Democratic challengers in 24 Republican-controlled districts where Trump won less than 50 percent of the vote in November and whose lawmakers voted in support of the GOP health-care bill. … In light of the vote, we are shifting our ratings in 20 districts, all reflecting enhanced opportunities for Democrats. The major caveat is that 18 months is an eternity in politics and that as always, we will continue to adjust our outlook as events unfold and the landscape develops. A separate ActBlue page for Democratic challengers to any House Republican who voted to support the bill had raised $405,783 by 10:27 a.m. Eastern on Friday. And Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to promote what appeared to be a different ActBlue page to fund challengers to Republicans who voted for the bill in swing districts. [Every Republican who voted for this abomination must be held accountable] Keep an eye out for other shifts in the political landscape, in which Democrats already have an enthusiasm advantage. We expect to see more demonstrations back in House districts, including town hall meetings and improved recruitment. Conversely, Republicans may suffer a difficult recruiting year and suffer more retirements. That’s just on the House side. On the Senate side, The Post reports: “If Senate Democrats needed a miracle not to lose a ton of seats in the 2018 midterm elections, they’re pretty sure House Republicans just gave them one: Passing a bill that could kick tens of millions of people off their health insurance, then cheering about it behind a historically unpopular president.” Really, who is going to punish a red state Democratic senator who opposes a bill that would kick state residents off Medicaid and raise premiums for older, rural Americans? The House bill may also create trouble for vulnerable Republicans such as Sens. Jeff Flake (Ariz.) and Dean Heller (Nev.). Also consider if red state Republicans previously seen as safe now find themselves playing defense. Freshman Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) has few accomplishments to her name, already has faced angry protests and has a mediocre approval rating. The bill would hit her state hard: Lower-income individuals in Nebraska could see an $8,100 increase in their costs by 2020, and older residents could pay an additional $13,500, according to the analysis by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Only five states would see larger increases — Alaska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arizona and Wyoming. … Advocates are also concerned about proposed per-capita caps on the Medicaid program, touted as a way to reduce the federal government’s costs and give states more flexibility. The caps wouldn’t account for changes in the cost per enrollee beyond a predetermined growth limit, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. At-risk GOP senators could also face challenges from Republicans who claim incumbents have been too deferential to the White House and not concerned enough about the people back home. In sum, the AHCA poses a host of challenges for GOP lawmakers. Unless the Senate is able to come up with a popular alternative to the AHCA and get the House to agree, every GOP lawmaker is going to be saddled with the passage of a bill that no one wants to defend and would do considerable harm to the most vulnerable Americans.

"Yesterday, Republicans partied about their vote. Now comes the brutal hangover.","THE MORNING PLUM: As House Republicans were gearing up to pass their repeal-and-replace bill Thursday, reporters spotted cases of beers being rolled through the Capitol. It was not established whether the beers were related to their vote, but Republicans and President Trump did party in the Rose Garden to celebrate the bill’s passage — notwithstanding that it would result in 24 million fewer people covered over 10 years; gut protections for people with preexisting conditions; and slash spending on Medicaid by $800 billion while delivering to the rich an enormous tax cut. Today, House Republicans are waking up to a big set of brutal ratings changes from the Cook Political Report. In the wake of the vote, Cook has shifted 20 GOP-held seats toward Democrats. Yes, 20. The House passage of the bill “guarantees Democrats will have at least one major on-the-record vote to exploit in the next elections,” Cook analyst David Wasserman writes, adding that the GOP passage of a bill this unpopular “is consistent with past scenarios that have generated a midterm wave.” The changes shift three House GOP districts from “Lean Republican” to “Toss up”; another 11 from “Likely Republican” to “Lean Republican”; and another six from “Solid Republican” to “Likely Republican.” Virtually all the Republicans in those districts voted for the health-care bill.  The result is that overall, Cook’s ratings now put approximately two dozen GOP-held seats in the “Toss Up” or “Lean Republican” categories, meaning that they seem vulnerable as of now — and Democrats must flip 24 House seats to win the lower chamber. Many more somewhat less vulnerable Republicans voted for the bill, too, potentially putting even more seats within reach. “Not only did dozens of Republicans in marginal districts just hitch their names to an unpopular piece of legislation, Democrats just received another valuable candidate recruitment tool,” Wasserman added. (Another 20 or so are in the “Likely Republican” category, which are harder to reach, but it’s not impossible that the political environment could deteriorate further for House Republicans in coming months.) Other analysts have reached similar conclusions. Daily Kos’ Stephen Wolf posted this chart, showing that 24 of the House Republicans who voted for the health-care bill come from districts where Trump carried less than 50 percent of the vote, 14 of them won by Hillary Clinton: New: These 24 House Republicans voted for Trumpcare in seats where Trump got less than 50% of the vote in 2016 #AHCA https://t.co/ZlLteeJmgo pic.twitter.com/7Lb0Z0j8jJ — Stephen Wolf (@PoliticsWolf) May 4, 2017   Meanwhile, Nate Silver takes stock of the abysmal unpopularity of the bill and concludes that the vote for it could prove “a job-killer for GOP incumbents.” And Nate Cohn draws a comparison between yesterday’s vote and the 2010 vote for the Affordable Care Act that helped cost Democrats dozens of House seats and their majority. As Cohn notes, if that history is any guide, it’s possible that those Republicans who voted for the GOP bill could lose substantial support in the next election. To be sure, there are plenty of caveats. Republican districts tend to be safer than the 2010 Democratic districts were. The GOP bill probably won’t pass in anything like its current form. A milder version might end up emerging once the Senate weighs in. The Republican bill, whatever it ends up looking like, might get more popular. Or nothing may pass, and all this could fade from memory. But as Cohn concludes, it’s not impossible that things could get worse from here, if a Republican plan does pass in some form, because the changes it imposes could be felt before the 2018 elections: Many effects of the new health plan could hit before the midterms. If those changes are wrenching to too many people, it is certainly possible that the Republican grip on the House will be in serious jeopardy — and that a lot of members have just cast votes that could define their career. There are several layers of irony worth appreciating. Note, for instance, that the vote for the plan may end up putting a lot of Republicans at risk even if nothing like the current plan ends up passing. By contrast, many Democrats sacrificed their careers with a vote for a bill that did become law. What’s more, as Paul Kane reports, many Republicans voted for this dangerous bill even though they didn’t like it all that much. They did this for a variety of reasons — caucus politics; pressure from Trump; a perceived need to show that House Republicans can govern; to increase the odds for other priorities. By contrast, the Democrats who voted for the ACA did so because they believed in it — and helped contribute to a historic coverage expansion as a result, though that may be in danger now. The House GOP bill now faces very long odds in the Senate, precisely because it’s a moral and political disaster. One of the big moral questions at the core of the health-care debate is whether to vastly roll back the ACA’s spending and regulations that are currently enabling so many poor and sick people to gain coverage, and to again put that coverage at risk. The GOP bill puts this coverage in danger for millions. Thus, many GOP senators and governors — for political and principled reasons alike — are not going to accept the House GOP bill’s deep cuts to Medicaid and weakening of protections for people with preexisting conditions. The result will be a long, intense debate that serves to focus more attention — possibly for months — on the albatross that many vulnerable House Republicans just hung around their own necks. ********************************************************************** * GOP SENATORS FACE TOUGH ROAD ON HEALTH BILL: The New York Times sums up the difficulties ahead for the repeal-and-replace bill in the Senate: Senate Republicans will face some of the same dynamics that stymied the House for weeks. Moderate senators will demand significant concessions, which in turn could alienate three hard-liners: Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah. Republican senators are certain to face pressure from governors worried about constituents on Medicaid losing their coverage. The House bill’s phase-out of the Medicaid expansion is likely to be opposed by GOP senators and governors from states that opted into it. But conservatives won’t accept anything that doesn’t phase it out. * KEEP AN EYE ON THE GOP GOVERNORS: The Associated Press adds this about the House GOP bill’s phase-out of the Medicaid expansion: Many of the 31 states that accepted Obama’s expansion of that program are led by GOP governors, and senators have no interest in cutting their states’ funds and taking coverage away from voters. Republican senators also represent states ravaged by deaths caused by opioid abuse. The House measure would let states escape Obama’s requirement that insurers cover anti-drug services. Yeah, this bill is going to get slaughtered by many Republicans in the days and weeks ahead. * BIG PROCEDURAL CHALLENGE LOOMS IN SENATE: The new GOP bill added provisions allowing states to seek waivers on essential benefits and preexisting conditions, to win over conservatives. The Post points out this will create a new set of problems in the Senate: The original proposal initially left many of the ACA’s insurance regulations alone — with the goal of ensuring it would pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian — but not all of them. The House’s version of the bill would undercut the ACA’s insurance regulations even more. That might make it difficult for Republican senators to pass the measure under a procedural maneuver known as “reconciliation,” which is usually reserved for budget legislation. This is a problem. It means Republicans probably can pass measures impacting the Medicaid expansion, subsidies and individual mandate with a simple majority — but probably can’t pass these sorts of deregulatory features conservatives want. * STATE OFFICIALS NOT CRAZY ABOUT HOUSE GOP BILL: Politico asks GOP governors and state legislators whether they would seek waivers from the ban on insurers jacking up premiums on preexisting conditions, if the GOP bill ever becomes law: Not a single governor has stepped up to say they want to take advantage of that leeway. Officials in a dozen states surveyed by POLITICO weren’t eager to embrace opt-outs that would let states skirt key insurance provisions, including safeguards for people with pre-existing conditions and a set of basic, required health benefits … for now, state officials are holding back. Governors run the risk of being blamed for abandoning patients with pre-existing conditions if they grab any of these exemptions. What a shocker. If somehow this does become law, this would put them in a terrible spot, because they’d come under tremendous pressure from the right to seek these waivers. * HOUSE MODERATE PREDICTS BILL WILL BE ‘GUTTED’: Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.). who opposed the bill, had this to say about what’s next for GOP moderates who voted for it: “Members have been asked to vote for a bill that is particularly treacherous, that is going nowhere in the Senate. This legislation will be gutted and we will have voted for a bill that will never become law. Will it cause headaches for people? Absolutely.” Yeah, pretty much. But at least those moderates don’t have to fear being punished by Trump’s terrifying Twitter feed! * THE TRUMPISM OF THE DAY: After the health-care bill passed yesterday, Trump murmured a few things about how Trumpcare is going to make America awesome again, then said this to the prime minister of Australia: “It’s going to be fantastic health care,” Trump said, referring to his new health care plan. “I shouldn’t say this to our great gentleman and my friend from Australia because you have better health care than we do.” Australia has universal health care. On Chris Hayes’s show last night, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) burst into laughter after being played a video of Trump’s remarks. It’s worth a watch. * AND TRUMP JUST WANTED A ‘WIN’: Politico reports on a call between Trump and Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who had opposed the health-care bill, angering Trump, before delivering the amendment that salvaged it: Trump did not want to talk about the merits of the legislation — he didn’t care much about those specifics, senior officials said. What mattered to him was how a failed vote would hobble his presidency and the ability to get other legislation through Congress. He wanted a win. As always, Trump clearly has no knowledge whatsoever of what’s in his policies or the human toll they would inflict on millions. But now he’s finally attained the “win” of wiping out President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Oh, wait, he hasn’t attained that yet at all.

The House doesn’t bother to defend the indefensible health-care bill,"Before the House narrowly voted to pass the American Health Care Act, you could tell that Republicans supporting it would be in for a tough time. The first clue came from Republicans themselves. Most vividly in their mini-statements during the floor debate, in interviews they gave and in statements they released, House Republicans almost to a person refused to tout the AHCA as a good bill, an improvement over Obamacare. Obamacare is failing. We promised the American people we’d do this. There was plenty of hyperbole. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) proclaimed: “That is not a choice. This is a crisis.” He seemed to be arguing that there was no other solution or legislation that could possibly be devised that would respond to Obamacare’s difficulties. The Republican who used to be considered an impressive wonk was, in essence, imploring members not to rationally think through the legislation they were about to pass. No Congressional Budget Office score, no real debate, no reflection on the bill’s merits. The resort to out-and-out lies (e.g. insisting that everyone with a preexisting condition would be protected) and insistence that something had to be done underscored how indefensible was the bill on its merits. Politico reported: Rep. Luke Messer, an Indiana Republican, called it a “green flag” and a “start.” Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) also pushed the idea that Republicans just need to pull the trigger on this bill because it will change. “This thing is going to go to the United States Senate. It’s going to change in my view,” he said on NPR. “At some point you just have to move, and we think this is it. This will create some momentum.” . . . . Leadership aides have described the legislation more in practical terms — let’s get it done — than wow, this is good. White House officials have argued to lawmakers that the bill will look totally different in the Senate and they just need political momentum. “Everyone knows this won’t be the final product,” one senior administration official said. “So if you don’t like something, it’s fine.” This was an act of gross recklessness — betting that the Senate would save House Republicans from themselves — and cynicism. It is hard to recall another piece of legislation of this magnitude in which there was effectively no argument that, if passed, it would improve the lives of Americans. The second sign that the House Republicans had entirely missed the mark came from Senate Republicans, who treated the House product with disdain, refusing even to consider it seriously. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted, “I appreciate the apparent progress on health care reform in the House of Representatives. I will admit, I’m concerned with the process.” He continued, “A bill — finalized yesterday, has not been scored, amendments not allowed, and 3 hours final debate — should be viewed with caution.” In a written statement, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said the bill raised more questions than it answered. “In order to answer these questions and others, we really need the Congressional Budget Office to assess the impact of the bill on coverage, costs and premiums. That has not yet been completed,” she admonished Republicans. “This is an extremely important debate with significant implications for millions of Americans. We need to spend the time necessary to get this right and work to achieve the goal of expanding access to health care that is truly affordable and accessible.” The House bill is so flawed and insufficient that the Senate has already set to work drafting something entirely different. The Washington Examiner reported that a 12-person working group is developing a Senate proposal: “We are going to draft a Senate bill,” added Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. “That is what I’ve been told.” The working group has been meeting for weeks, said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, a member of the group. “What we have to do is build a consensus among our conference and that is what the working group is designed to do,” Cornyn said. “To get to a compromise we can agree to and then present it to the larger conference.” One has to ask why a GOP House majority is necessary if its answer to the most important legislative goal is: The Senate will do it.

The Daily 202: French presidential election becomes Trump vs. Obama proxy war,"With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Barack Obama’s decision to record a commercial for French presidential frontrunner Emmanuel Macron reflects the global significance of Sunday’s election. It also puts him, very publicly, on the opposite side of Donald Trump. Just as the former president spoke out against Brexit before last year’s referendum in the U.K., he sees this closing ad as a necessary defense of globalization and the international order that he believes would be further in jeopardy if Marine Le Pen wins. The populist leader of the far-right National Front party wants to pull out of the euro currency and majorly restrict immigration. “The French election is very important to the future of France and the values that we care so much about,” Obama says to camera. “Because the success of France matters to the entire world. … (Macron) has stood up for liberal values. He put forward a vision for the important role that France plays in Europe and around the world, and he is committed to a better future for the French people. He appeals to people’s hopes and not their fears. … Because of how important this election is, I also want you to know that I am supporting Emmanuel Macron to lead you forward. En Marche! Vive la France!” En Marche, which translates to “Onward,” is the name of the new party founded by Macron last year, an independent coalition that blends fiscal conservatism and social liberalism. -- President Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly signaled his support for Le Pen. She's the strongest on borders"
Republicans’ plan to protect sick people has a long history of not protecting sick people,"Republicans technically have a plan for covering sick people: setting up a system that could do so, but, if history is any guide, wouldn't. Welcome to “high-risk pools,” the government-subsidized groups for people who — in the world where insurance companies can go back to their pre-Obamacare practice of discriminating against those with preexisting conditions — can't get covered on their own. In theory, the pools can be a good way to make sure money is going to the people who need it the most. But in practice, they don't tend to give out enough money in the first place. Which is why the GOP's plan to repeal Obamacare's protections for the sick and replace them with high-risk pools might literally be a life-or-death gamble for a lot of people. Now, the first thing to know about high-risk pools is that they aren't magic. They don't make it any cheaper to cover sick people. That costs what it costs regardless of whether we pay for it with a combination of higher premiums and higher taxes (like Obamacare does), or with higher taxes alone (like high-risk pools would). And yes, it's something that “we” have to pay for, since the most serious illnesses cost far more than anyone could pay on their own. Indeed, the sickest 5 percent of people make up 50 percent of health-care spending. Although there's a big caveat here. The idea that high-risk pools won't save any money is based on the assumption that, as President Trump put it, we won't have people “dying in the streets.” In other words, that we'll adequately fund the high-risk pools. We haven't in the past. Before Obamacare, you see, a lot of states had their own high-risk pools that were supposed to do what Republicans say they will today: cover sick people separately so that healthy people aren't burdened with higher premiums. The only problem was they forgot to do that first part. State governments didn't put anywhere near enough money into their high-risk pools, with the predictable result that these only slightly subsidized costs were still too expensive for a lot of people with preexisting conditions. And even then, they often faced lifetime limits on their coverage. Not to mention the fact that there were long waiting periods before you could join — not something, say, a cancer patient could afford. Here's why that matters now. Republicans don't actually want to set up their own high-risk pool. They want the states to do that themselves — with $138 billion coming from Washington over the next 10 years. But there are three problems with this. First, this almost certainly isn't enough money. Even conservatives like James Capretta and Tom Miller think that high-risk pools would need around $150 billion to $200 billion to work over the next decade. Emily Gee of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, meanwhile, thinks it's more like $330 billion. Second, this money isn't even required to go to high-risk pools. States could also use it to offset costs for healthy people in the individual market — which is what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects they'll do. And third, this funding isn't flexible. It's a one-time grant that states won't have an easy time supplementing since they have to balance their budgets every year. The result would be a much more precarious than the system we have now where sick people can't be charged more and any subsidy they get automatically goes up with their premiums to try to keep them from being priced out of the market. Which brings us to Trumpcare's two big mirages. The first is that it absolutely covers people with preexisting conditions. It doesn't. It lets states opt out of the Obamacare rules protecting the sick and then lets them set up high-risk pools that wouldn't have enough money. It's hard to say how much worse off people with preexisting conditions would be, but it seems pretty clear that they would be. The health-care consultancy Avalere, for one, estimates that even in the best-case scenario, only 25 percent of people with preexisting conditions would be covered under this Republican plan. The second is that Trumpcare is a health-care bill. It's not. It's a trillion dollar tax cut for the top 2 percent that's paid for with a trillion dollars of health-care cuts for the poor and middle class. Or, as Trump would call it, “something terrific.” He just left out that that's only for people making $200,000 or more. Not being rich is the ultimate preexisting condition. "
Who gets hurt — and when — if Trumpcare becomes law,"House Republicans, eager to upend the Affordable Care Act (ACA), have passed a bill that independent arbiters such as the Congressional Budget Office say would increase the number of uninsured by millions, cut Medicaid by $800 billion, and raise premiums and deductibles — especially for those with preexisting conditions. But if this legislation, in its current form, is eventually enacted, the fallout won’t come immediately or all at once. It’s likely to take place over several years, in a sequence of events affecting tens of millions of people. Here’s a glimpse of how the next few years might unfold under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) if it becomes law: [Trump wants to force you — the taxpayer — to pay for campaigning from the pulpit] [Trump isn’t putting America first. And that’s a good thing.] House members passed a bill they had only a few days to review. Perhaps, knowing all the above, the Senate will be more judicious.

This is what Americans will really dislike about the House ‘Trumpcare’ bill,"House Republicans voted Thursday to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with their alternative plan, the American Health Care Act. This is a big political victory — and a big win for the Trump administration. However, it will likely create headaches for the Republican legislators who voted for it — and, depending on what happens next, Republicans more broadly. Next, the AHCA may die in the Senate, where it faces a much tougher challenge, leaving House Republicans on the record as having cast a vote on an unpopular piece of legislation that went nowhere. Or some version of the AHCA may actually pass the Senate, garner Trump’s signature and become law. Why the rush? Why did House Republicans rush through a vote on a complex piece of legislation affecting millions of Americans and nearly a fifth of the U.S. economy without waiting for an analysis of its effects from the Congressional Budget Office? [Even Republican doctors oppose discrimination against people with preexisting medical conditions] One answer: Republicans were holding together a very fragile coalition of legislators. Any further information — such as Jimmy Kimmel’s emotional monologue about his newborn son’s heart condition — could erode public support for the already unpopular legislation. House leaders feared that would make it impossible to pass without still more amendments — or having to start over completely. No matter what happens in the Senate, House Republicans face minefields Most public discussion so far has been about how the AHCA will change the ACA’s most popular provisions like guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting conditions. But even unpopular provisions could cause problems. For instance, only 35 percent of the public supports the individual mandate — which requires everyone to have health insurance or pay an annual fine. But our research suggests that Republicans may face backlash even there, once opponents highlight what the AHCA uses to replace the mandate. [Here are 3 things we learned from Republicans’ earlier failure to repeal Obamacare] Insurance marketplaces need healthy people to pay for insurance, or insurers won’t have a pool of money to cover those who are sick. So how can healthy people be enticed into buying it? Subsidies (or “carrots”) are rarely enough, and therefore penalties (or “sticks”) are often used to ensure enough individuals are paying into the system. Repealing the ACA’s penalty may be popular now, but what will replace it? So far, “Trumpcare” handles this by replacing it with a “continuous coverage requirement.” If you let your health insurance coverage lapse for more than 63 days, you would have to pay a 30 percent late-enrollment surcharge on top of the premium for the next year. (The bill passed with two amendments affecting these penalties. The widely debated MacArthur amendment lets states seek waivers to enable insurers to charge higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions who fall into this coverage gap. The late-breaking Upton amendment added Wednesday provides $8 billion in funds to offset some of these higher penalties for waiver states, but most analysts don’t think it’s enough). As we’ll explain, the penalty for lapsed enrollment in nonwaiver states will likely be quite unpopular. How we studied public responses to information about health insurance enrollment penalties From March 10 – 16, during the debate over the first version of the AHCA, we fielded a survey experiment on a nationally drawn sample of 1,588 Americans. Participants were asked to read a short news excerpt about both the ACA and the Republican plan to repeal and replace it. We randomly varied the excerpt. Some respondents got only basic information: that the ACA, also known as Obamacare, was passed into law in 2010 and that Republicans in Congress were currently trying to repeal and replace it with the AHCA. Others also learned about the ACA’s individual mandate and the tax penalty for not enrolling. A third group read the same text about the ACA penalty and also read about the AHCA’s proposal to replace the tax penalty with the 30 percent enrollment-gap penalty. We asked respondents whether they had a generally favorable or unfavorable view of the ACA and of the AHCA and then whether they preferred the ACA or the ACHA (respondents were allowed to check “neither”). We also asked about what they knew about ACA and AHCA components, so we could assess public awareness of their policy details. ACA tax penalty is well known, AHCA enrollment gap penalty is largely unknown By March 2017, people were well aware that the ACA requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty to the government. In the group that got only basic information about the ACA, nearly three in four correctly identified the tax penalty as part of the ACA. That’s more than knew about any other components, including subsidies for low-income citizens. But only 28 percent knew that the AHCA would penalize enrollment gaps. That’s fewer than knew either that the ACHA would repeal the subsidies; how the law would treat preexisting conditions; or that young adults under 26 could stay on their parents’ insurance. Highlighting the AHCA’s penalty erodes its support Emphasizing the ACA tax penalty has no effect on whether respondents favor the ACA, even when we adjust for key demographics like partisanship and voting for Trump. But telling respondents about the AHCA’s enrollment gap penalty makes them less enthusiastic about the GOP bill. When asked explicitly which they prefer, respondents told about both the ACA’s tax penalty and the AHCA’s enrollment gap penalty are more likely to prefer the ACA. The CBO report may have lowered support for the AHCA even further Because we were surveying respondents both before and after the Congressional Budget Office released its score for the AHCA’s first iteration, we can check whether the report affected public opinion. In short: yes. Even after adjusting for a time trend, after the report was released, respondents were less favorable toward the AHCA. As much as citizens don’t like the requirement to purchase insurance or pay a penalty to the government, our evidence suggests that they dislike the AHCA’s penalty paid to insurers even more. In short, AHCA opponents and potential challengers to House Republicans can choose from among many lines of attack: the public is already concerned about protections for people with preexisting conditions, huge cuts to the Medicaid program, and citizens losing insurance. Highlighting the AHCA’s coverage-gap penalty could drop public support further.

Even Republican doctors oppose discrimination against people with preexisting medical conditions,"The House of Representatives has just passed a Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This bill allows states to opt out of provisions that would prevent insurance companies from charging higher prices to people with existing medical conditions who do not maintain continuous coverage. Estimates suggest that about 2.2 million enrollees in the individual marketplace have a preexisting condition.* What do doctors think about this? From December through January, we surveyed 1,000 primary-care physicians across the United States to assess their views toward the ACA as it currently exists and potential changes to the law. After excluding physicians who were ineligible (e.g., because of wrong addresses), 45 percent responded. Physicians — even if they’re Republican — want protection for patients with preexisting conditions There is remarkable consensus among physicians — they don’t want insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions. Nearly all (95.1 percent) of the physicians who responded thought it was important to the health of the U.S. population to prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage or charging higher prices on the basis of preexisting conditions. It may not be surprising that all physicians who wanted to keep or expand former president Barack Obama’s health law supported provisions to protect patients. What is perhaps more surprising is that high numbers of physicians who wanted to repeal or scale back the ACA also supported these protections. The same is true of over 90 percent of physicians who supported the Republican Party. We can’t tell you, on the basis of our data, why physicians supported these provisions. Perhaps they were motivated by fundamental issues of fairness. As physicians ourselves, we understand that serious illness can strike anyone, as Jimmy Kimmel movingly pointed out. Physicians may also have firsthand experience of the barriers that many patients used to face in securing and retaining insurance coverage because of their preexisting conditions before the ACA was introduced, leading them to worry about a possible return to the old system. Another possible explanation is fear that proposed alternative solutions won’t work. Evidence suggests that high-risk pools are often underfunded and inadequate to meet the needs of many with preexisting conditions. Regardless of the underlying reasons, the data tells a clear story: Even physicians who were in favor of scaling back or repealing the ACA say that scrapping protections for people with preexisting conditions is the wrong way to improve health care. The American Medical Association, which came out against the House bill, probably represents the views of the majority of physicians in the United States with respect to preexisting conditions.

Craig Pollack is an associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. *Correction: an earlier version of this incorrectly characterized this provision.

Did Republicans just score a win on health care — or lose?,"The GOP-led House passed a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act by a 217-to-213 margin, sending it to the Senate, where GOP members were already throwing cold water on a bill passed with no Congressional Budget Office score or real understanding of its implications. The picture of House Republicans wildly celebrating the bill, which will never become law and which, according to the CBO, would remove 24 million people from coverage and bestow a huge tax cut on the very, very rich, may come back to haunt them. President Trump and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) claimed “victory,” but their celebrations may be short-lived. A number of moderate members in districts that Hillary Clinton won were compelled to vote for a bill that the public has overwhelmingly rejected — at least according to polls. The biggest problems for Trump and the GOP (aside from getting the Senate and House to agree upon and sign something) are the decidedly unpopulist features of the bill — tax cuts for the super-rich, higher premiums for older and more rural voters and a rollback of Medicaid that allowed millions of Americans to afford coverage. If Democrats are able to portray this as a cruel repudiation of Trump’s promise to take care of the “forgotten men and women,” both he and the GOP are due for their political comeuppance. [Every Republican who voted for this abomination must be held accountable] The Trumpcare legislation, if it passes, will become an issue in every governor’s race and in hundreds of state legislative races, where Republicans have dominated. GOP state candidates on the ballot will have to make clear their position — do they favor “opt-out” or no? Do they take responsibility for high-risk pools that,  according to experts, are woefully underfunded by the American Health Care Act? Two gubernatorial races this year — one in New Jersey and the other in Virginia — will be early indications as to how this is all playing out. The congressional race in Georgia’s 6th District — already a hyped, multimillion-dollar race — is about to get even more attention. Democrat Jon Ossoff will force Republican Karen Handel to state her position and then slam her and other Republicans for cavalier, irresponsible governance that may harm millions of Americans. As House members now head out to recess, Democratic protesters (the “Resistance”) will make their show of force. We will see whether that, and the belated CBO score, is enough to rattle both House and Senate Republicans. Republicans have shown that they are competent enough to destroy the Obama legacy. But what they have yet to show is whether they have something better — or will themselves pay the price for unbridled arrogance and inattention to the public’s belief that Americans really do deserve health-care coverage, regardless of their ability to pay.

"The GOP’s strange, ugly strategy of rushing today’s vote will backfire. Here’s how.","THE MORNING PLUM: House GOP leaders are confidently forging ahead with the repeal-and-replace vote today, and they are laughing off questions as to why they would go forward despite their willfully premature and dim understanding of how the measure might impact millions of Americans and one-sixth of the U.S. economy. They are doing this without seeing a nonpartisan analysis of their new bill from the Congressional Budget Office — which will, conveniently, allow them to conceal the full truth of what they are voting for from their constituents. But this is likely to backfire. Here’s why: The Congressional Budget Office score of the bill is coming, anyway — as soon as next week. And it will land after an untold number of House Republicans have committed themselves to the bill. A Democratic leadership aide tells me that the CBO has confirmed to Democratic leaders that the CBO score will be completed and delivered next week or the week after. This means moderate and vulnerable House Republicans who are already worried about explaining to their constituents why they voted for the bill — which guts protections for the sick and rolls back coverage for millions of poor and working-class people while delivering a huge tax cut to the rich — will have to justify it again, in light of a nonpartisan analysis spelling out the grisly details of what they really voted for. To be sure, Republicans have their own stated reasons, if you can call them that, for rushing this vote. GOP leaders want to hold this vote before Republicans go on recess, which could sap momentum, and the White House has been putting extreme pressure on them to get this done. [Is the atrocious health-care bill a lose-lose proposition for Republicans?] Meanwhile, the justifications for the rushed vote coming from individual Republicans have rapidly devolved into low comedy. One GOP congressman, when asked how he knows what’s in the bill without a CBO score, claimed: “I just know.” Another, in a moment of accidental candor, said: “I would prefer to have it scored, but more than that I want it to pass.” (Does this mean that the former is a threat to the latter? Probably!) A third claimed that the rushed vote is no big deal, because the CBO already scored the last version of the bill, and the new one is “substantially similar.” But it’s perfectly plausible that the new CBO score could show that the new version is substantially worse than the last one. The old CBO score found that the last bill could leave 24 million people without coverage — 14 million of them due to the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion — while driving up premiums in the near term for older people. The new bill won over conservatives by allowing states to waive the requirement that insurers cover essential health benefits and refrain from jacking up premiums on people with preexisting conditions. Many analysts have pointed out that the latter provision could lead to soaring costs for the sick, potentially pushing them off coverage. To deal with this, GOP leaders agreed to a last-minute change to the bill that would provide a paltry additional $8 billion to help those people. This may have succeeded in giving moderates the fig leaf they need to vote for it. But the new CBO score could illustrate with new vividness the true impact of the new bill’s relaxation on protections for preexisting conditions — and show that this last-minute change is not going to mitigate the damage it could do to them in any meaningful sense. As it is, most analysts already agree that it won’t, but the CBO could enshrine this in a great deal more detail. Nicholas Bagley, a health policy expert and law professor at the University of Michigan, emails me: A CBO score would give us some sense of how relaxing the ban on discriminating against people with preexisting conditions would affect coverage. It would also show moderate Republicans just how little difference an infusion of $8 billion will make to the overall coverage figures. Congressional Republicans are shooting in the dark here. They may not like what they find when CBO turns on the lights. Harold Pollack, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, adds that the new CBO score could demonstrate that premiums are going to rise for the sick in spite of the latest GOP efforts to throw a few pennies (relatively speaking) at that problem: The new CBO score could easily show even higher premiums for people with costly conditions, not withstanding efforts to paper over these difficulties. It could also show even greater numbers of people losing coverage relative to current law. There are also substantial risks that CBO would simply find embarrassing errors due to the rushed and slipshod process through which AHCA was produced and repeatedly modified. The new CBO score could easily show fewer people covered, more difficulties with insurance markets, and higher premiums for people in greatest need of help. If this happens, it will put moderate and vulnerable Republicans who supported the bill in an odd spot. They will be at home on recess, hearing from their constituents, and they will have to justify their vote for something that threatens to inflict all the harm that the new CBO score has now projected it will inflict. [Trump’s nifty plan to spend more and hurt poor people more — at the same time!] What’s more, they will also have to explain in retrospect why they rushed the vote in advance of a CBO score detailing its impact, even though it was only a few days away — and is designed to help them make a more informed choice about what it is they were truly voting for. At that point, though, it will be too late. They will already be on the hook for it. ******************************************************************** * HERE ARE THE WHIP COUNTS ON THE GOP BILL: The Post counts 20 Nos or lean Nos, and 35 who are undecided or unclear. The New York Times counts 18 Nos and 33 who are undecided or unclear. CNN counts 21 Nos and 15 who are undecided. HuffPost counts 16 Nos, 3 lean Nos and 14 undecided. The Hill counts 18 Nos and 52 undecideds. Presuming all members vote, and presuming all Democrats vote No, Republicans can lose no more than 22 votes, or it goes down. * GOP LEADERS SAY THEY HAVE THE VOTES: The Post reports that GOP leaders appear certain of passage: Republican leaders huddled in the office of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) on Wednesday evening…Several said they would hold a vote this week only if they felt certain it could pass — meaning they now think they have the votes. Exiting the relatively brief leadership meeting, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) guaranteed victory. “Do we have the votes? Yes. Will we pass it? Yes,” he told reporters. A vote is expected in the early afternoon. Remember, however: There is no telling what will survive of this bill in the Senate, yet House moderates will be on the hook for supporting it, anyway. * HERE’S WHAT A WAVERING MODERATE LOOKS LIKE: The New York Times spotlights the wavering of Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), a former No who may vote Yes, thanks to the amendment added by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) that adds a paltry $8 billion for preexisting conditions: In a Twitter post on Thursday morning, he said he had just told House Republican leaders that the bill “in its current form fails to sufficiently protect Americans with pre-existing conditions.” In a late afternoon interview, he said, “I do not yet have a position on the bill.” He wanted to hear more from Mr. Upton, a respected Republican voice on health care. Curbelo is now saying a big state like his is not going to seek a waiver from banning jacked-up premiums on preexisting conditions. Really? And what about all the other red states? * PELOSI VOWS TO MAKE REPUBLICANS PAY: Nancy Pelosi sent her Democratic House colleagues a letter last night that said this: Maliciously, with only hours’ notice and without a CBO score, Republicans will attempt to destroy the health care and coverage of the American people — all of this to inflict a $600 billion transfer of wealth from working families to corporations and the richest people in the country. Republicans are fraudulently claiming that Trumpcare covers Americans with pre-existing conditions. It does not!!…Together, we will once again expose Trumpcare’s disastrous consequences for hard-working families and seniors across America. Maintaining Democratic unity will be key. This is a small preview of what millions of dollars in ads attacking House Republicans will look like. * THE TRUTH ABOUT GOP BILL AND PREEXISTING CONDITIONS: House Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republicans claim their bill will still protect people with preexisting conditions, but Glenn Kessler has a deep dive into all of the uncertainties those people will face if the GOP bill ever becomes law. Bottom line: “Despite Ryan’s tweet that people with preexisting conditions are protected, there is no guarantee that they will not face higher costs than under current law.” And of course, “higher costs” could lead many to be priced out of the market, and shunted into high-risk pools that are underfunded, also slap them with high costs, or leave them uncovered entirely. As Kessler demonstrates, there are all kinds of unknowns that lie ahead. * REPUBLICANS QUIETLY GEARING UP FOR MAJOR SPENDING CUTS: Bloomberg Politics reports that House Republicans are quietly taking preliminary procedural steps to lay the groundwork for big cuts to mandatory spending. Such programs include Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment benefits and food stamps. But wait, you say, didn’t Donald Trump promise not to touch entitlements? Well, yes, he did. And maybe he’ll still stick by that. Or maybe he won’t. * RED-STATE DEMOCRATS SURVIVING IN TRUMP ERA: Politico offers an interesting look at how Senate Democrats up for reelection in states carried by Trump — such as Sherrod Brown, Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin and Bob Casey — are quietly racking up wins they can tout. Among them: pet items in the spending bill and a permanent extension of health benefits for miners. The backstory here is that many of these Democrats are not showing any political fear of Trump and are sticking with their party in bucking his agenda. Compiling accomplishments may be key to whether they can hang on for reelection in spite of that.

The Daily 202: 10 storylines to follow as the House votes on health care,"With Breanne Deppisch THE BIG IDEA: Kevin McCarthy has guaranteed victory when the House votes today on a health care bill that would overhaul Obamacare. “Do we have the votes? Yes. Will we pass it? Yes,” the majority leader told reporters last night. The Rules Committee met late last night to take procedural steps and approve the compromises that have been made. -- Some guidance on timing, via Steve Scalise’s office: Around 10:30 a.m., the House will have its first votes of the day. Then the chamber will begin formal debate. Between approximately 1:15 p.m. and 1:45 p.m., the House will vote on this legislation. Members are being told they’ll be free to leave the floor by 2:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. -- What you need to know about the state of play: This vote is going to be very close, and the whipping will continue until the last minute. House Republicans can afford to lose no more than 22 GOP votes. The running whip count that Amber Phillips has been keeping for us is fluid, but she has 20 members who are on the record saying they are opposed to or leaning no on the bill. Another 35 are undecided or refuse to say, and 23 more have switched to yes. That leaves very little margin for error. Rep. Jason Chaffetz has even returned to D.C. after getting foot surgery in Utah – before he was supposed to travel – so that he can vote. GOP leadership aides say they are mindful that the bill cannot pass by just one vote. They know that, if that happens, Democrats can run attack ads describing each supporter of the bill as “THE DECIDING VOTE” on a measure that remains quite unpopular. How do they know this? Because they successfully used that talking point against Democratic senators for three election cycles in a row. Annoyingly for the strategists tasked with holding the majority, the number of Republicans with safe seats who are voting no is putting a lot more pressure on vulnerable members in swing districts to support the bill. These guys might normally get a pass because they’re going to face tough races in 2018. But House GOP leaders are now calling in all of their chits. If you want to watch someone closely today, look at Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman, who represents a suburban Denver district that went for Hillary Clinton. He issued a carefully worded statement yesterday that gave him cover to go either way and reflected the pressure he’s under from all sides: “The critics of the House bill are being totally disingenuous when they say the bill dooms those with preexisting ailments. … But I worry that, under the current language, a small percentage of those with preexisting conditions may not be adequately protected. If House Leadership will work to tighten protections for those with preexisting conditions, I'm a yes on sending this bill to the Senate for further consideration. If not, I'm a no, and we’ll go back to the drawing board to clean up the mess created by the Affordable Care Act.” Also keep an eye on Florida’s Carlos Curbelo. He’s close with party leadership and has grander ambitions, but Clinton carried his district – which stretches from Miami to Key West – by 16 points. “The easiest thing to do in this town is to say no,” he told one of our reporters on the Hill yesterday afternoon. “That’s usually the politically expedient thing to do. If I believe this legislation can be improved by the time it comes back to the House, I will be supporting it.” When a CNN reporter followed up last night, he remained undecided: .@RepCurbelo tells me he is currently out at restaurant and hasn't seen the new health care bill. He will review when he gets back. He’s not alone in holding his cards very close to the vest. Presumably, a lot of members really want to vote against a bill full of fodder for attack ads. But they know they must walk the plank if leadership cannot get their colleagues on board. Consider the case of California’s Darrell Issa: A reporter for The Hill posted this on Twitter: Reporters ask Rep. Issa his position on the revised healthcare bill. None of your business"
"The Republican health-care plan makes no sense at all, except the perfect kind","So here’s an idea: How about passing a health-care bill with no Congressional Budget Office score, no public hearings, opposition from major health organizations and patient advocacy groups, and that will result in the loss of insurance for tens of millions of Americans? Sound good so far? The bill is gruesomely unpopular. Voting for it is bad politics if it ultimately fails, and even worse if it ultimately passes and its effects hit home. Sound better yet? And yet onward it grinds. Inexplicable. Except perfectly explicable. No it’s not just that President Trump needs a “win.” A politician needs this win like a person with a headache needs a hole drilled in his head to let the headache out. So why are the lemmings proceeding to amble off this cliff then? Because of the last feature of the GOP health-care bill that gets the least coverage, but what it is in fact all about. If this latest bill passes, it will share the one feature that all the GOP health-care bills share. I’ll pause for a three-count while you guess. That’s right! A huge tax cut for the rich! Yes, for the slow learners in the class, it’s about huge tax cuts for the rich, again. It is always about huge tax cuts for the rich. All that the GOP needs to do is the ritual hand-waving about how it’s really about health care, or that dying uncovered and broke is really what freedom is all about, or whatever. It no longer matters. The rich are running the GOP before, during and after the Trump “populist” revolt, and they are fully prepared to run it right into the ground, and you right into an early grave — if that’s what it takes to get their blessed tax cuts. It’s a one-way ratchet now. The path is set. It’s tax cuts for the rich at any cost, to anybody. This may be their eventual undoing, or ours, but here are the results so far. Since President Ronald Reagan set the game in motion, the rich have become steadily, and vastly, richer. And with those riches have come — surprise — increasing political power. And now it’s Trump, a classless act for sure, but he’ll do. And what he’ll do is destroy health care for tens of millions of Americans for the sake of more tax cuts for the rich. Wealth = power. Power = more wealth. This is all the math needed in the new core curriculum. It is plain enough to anyone who cares to see that the American agenda now is simply the agenda of the rich, by the rich and for the rich. And who is left now to stop them? "
Is the atrocious health-care bill a lose-lose proposition for Republicans?,"The Post reports: House Republican leaders said Wednesday that they plan to bring their controversial plan to revise key parts of the Affordable Care Act to a vote on Thursday, capping weeks of fits and starts in their attempt to fulfill a signature campaign promise. The flagging Republican effort to reshape the nation’s health-care system picked up steam Wednesday as GOP leaders tried to address concerns about people with preexisting medical conditions. But independent analysts remained skeptical that the new proposal would fully address the needs of at-risk patients who receive coverage guarantees under the Affordable Care Act, underscoring the contentious nature of the Republican effort. In an audacious move, the House leadership says it intends to force a vote on a bill that has not been scored in its current form or been seen by the vast number of members. The vote will occur without any financial justification for a new allotment of $8 billion over five years (a sliver of the amount that experts say is needed to provide accessible and affordable coverage to people with preexisting conditions through high-risk pools). Members will still be voting for a huge tax cut for the rich (contrary to Trump’s populist message), which simultaneously making coverage more expensive for older, rural Americans. It has been opposed by virtually every medical association (plus AARP) and retains provisions that a large percentage of Americans oppose (e.g. rolling back Medicaid, kicking as many as 24 million people off coverage, abolishing the essential benefits that must be offered). By most outside whip counts, the vote will be close — only a few votes above or below the 216 tally needed for passage. If the speaker needs to pull the bill or risk losing on the floor, he’ll suffer a humiliation that may well lose him the support of his conference. [The GOP’s strange, ugly strategy of rushing today’s vote will backfire. Here’s how.] As of this hour, a number of questions remain unanswered: The degree to which the House feels compelled to undertake unprincipled, even reckless, action may startle some observers. However, by now we should be accustomed to a president without concern for the merits of any measure and a right-wing contingent that is more afraid of failing to pass something than it is of hurting millions of Americans. Ryan no longer has the will or the ability to be the adult in the room who can bring his members to their senses. Democrats seemed ambivalent. On one hand, they plainly would like to put a stake through the heart of Trumpcare. Many Democrats and a few thoughtful conservatives sounded mortified that so many House members could be swayed by an $8 billion fig leaf that would obviously be insufficient to protect hard-to-insure Americans. (The liberal Center for American Progress calculated that “even if the House were to throw an additional $200 billion at high-risk pools to keep them afloat, that would do nothing to help consumers outside the risk pools. The other 9 in 10 people with pre-existing conditions would be vulnerable to thousands of dollars in health-based premium surcharges, and the return of medical underwriting would unravel the insurance market.”) Democrats honestly (and with some justification) think the GOP will deprive millions of Americans coverage for lifesaving care and, to be blunt, kill people. [House Republicans’ health-care amendments are making a terrible plan worse] On the other hand, most Democrats seem convinced that the Senate will reject this mess of a bill. A House vote for the bill will be the perfect cudgel to use against Republicans in 2018 and again in 2020. In essence, they figure, “Hey, why not let Republicans vote for something so bad that it’ll fail anyway and may well cost them the House majority and eventually the Senate majority and White House?” We will be watching to see whether Trumpcare does in fact pass, and if so, what the consequences for Republicans may be. The only thing we can say with certainty (we think) is that the bill in its current form will never become law. GOP senators are much too smart to go along with this policy and political debacle.

Republicans try yet another health care fig leaf,"The Post reports on the latest Republican machination as the House struggles to pass a health-care bill that looks less and less like repeal of Obamacare and more like a Rube Goldberg contraption to get this issue out of the House: Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) told the Associated Press that he is working on a proposal to provide more financial assistance for people with preexisting conditions. The language is expected to be circulated among House Republicans on Wednesday as leaders try to gather enough votes for a vote this week on a bill that would repeal and replace big parts of the Affordable Care Act. The amendment would add $8 billion over five years to help some patients with expensive conditions such as cancer or diabetes pay premiums and out-of-pocket costs. It’s aimed at reassuring moderate holdouts that people with preexisting conditions wouldn’t be priced out of the insurance marketplace, even though states could opt out of some protections for such patients. After insisting for years that “high-risk pools” were an adequate substitute for a system of community rating (i.e., prohibiting charging people with preexisting conditions more), this is a belated acknowledgement it is not so. Long wait times and high premiums have plagued these programs for years. The annual cost to keep them afloat and truly guarantee access to affordable care is $30 billion to $50 billion by some estimations — annually. It’s an odd way for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to proceed. First, he has personally been touting high-risk pools, so his credibility as a wonk takes another hit. Second, he is still pleading with vulnerable House members to cast a vote very much at odds with their constituents’ concerns. That risks the GOP majority in 2018 and his own speakership. That he would choose to throw moderates overboard rather than develop a moderate plan that might actually get through the Senate and come back speaks volumes about who holds the power in the House. (It’s not him; it’s the Freedom Caucus.) Third, since the amount proposed is so obviously insufficient, he opens himself up to the demand to fully fund the pools — either now during drafting or when, down the road, they run out of money. He is, in effect, setting up a new entitlement for the feds to directly fund people with preexisting conditions. That’s not remotely “market health care” and instead is a recipe for an obligation that might outstrip anything Obamacare imposed on the federal taxpayers. And finally, the House no doubt will proceed without a Congressional Budget Office score, opening members up to the charge that once again they acted in a grossly reckless fashion without knowing the impact of what they are voting for. This comes at a time when, according to a Post/ABC News poll, 70 percent of Americans oppose a state opt-out idea. The Post reported recently: Public sentiment is particularly lopsided in favor of an aspect of the current health-care law that blocks insurers from charging more or denying coverage to customers with medical conditions. About 8 in 10 Democrats, 7 in 10 independents and even a slight majority of Republicans say that should continue to be a national mandate, rather than an option for states to retain or drop. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) took to the Senate floor to warn moderate House Republicans that “even if the new version of Trumpcare passes the House — and we hope that it does not — its chances for survival in the Senate are small. We don’t even know if the new version would survive under the rules of reconciliation. … The reality is, Trumpcare cannot pass the Senate. So to my moderate Republican colleagues in the House, I ask: Why would you risk a yes vote for a bill that is devastating to your constituents and has a minuscule chance, probably no chance, of becoming law?” A further question might be asked: When the public finds out what a phony fix this is, do Republicans really think President Trump will stand behind them, or is he more likely to say Ryan and his members messed up and are hurting “his” people?

The public differs with Republicans on two critical health-care issues,"Republicans operate in a right-wing bubble in which they falsely assume that they have a mandate to govern as if Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had been elected president. It behooves them to remember that President Trump promised that he would cover “everyone” in his health-care plan, and when it came to Planned Parenthood, was less than stalwart. In the February 2016 debate, he hedged: “Millions of millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood. I would defund it because I’m pro-life, but millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.” In August 2015, he told CNN, “I would look at the good aspects of it and I would also look because I’m sure they do some things properly and good, good for women, and I would look at that.” Meanwhile, he told Sean Hannity, “They do good things. There’s two Planned Parenthoods, in a way.” Now the Democratic pollster Public Policy Polling finds that a “majority of voters in 13 Republican-held districts oppose defunding Planned Parenthood.” The numbers should be a wake-up call for Republicans: “The Public Policy Polling survey shows 59 percent of voters in 13 districts won by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton oppose defunding Planned Parenthood, compared with the 35 percent who support it.” Moreover, “Fifty-four percent said they would be less likely to vote for their GOP representative if they voted to defund Planned Parenthood, compared with 30 percent who said they would be more likely to support them.” According to the March Fox News poll, among all voters 57 percent have at least a somewhat favorable view of Planned Parenthood, while 32 percent do not. Among independents , 63 percent approve of Planned Parenthood. In short, Republicans in the country at large may support defunding Planned Parenthood, but voters in the districts of the most vulnerable GOP representatives do not, and the country overall has a very favorable impression of the group. There is more bad news for the GOP. As it turns out, coverage for those with preexisting conditions remains very popular. Politico reports: A new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows resistance to the new measure’s most controversial provision, with half of all voters opposing allowing states to decide whether to opt-out of requiring health insurance companies to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. It’s a key offering from GOP House leadership to conservatives wary that the party’s previous Obamacare replacement didn’t go far enough in unwinding the law. Only 38 percent of voters surveyed support allowing states to opt-out of these protections — a figure that underscores the struggle House Republicans and President Donald Trump are having in corralling votes from GOP members who represent districts that lean toward Democrats or are evenly divided. Even Republicans do not like the idea. (A plurality of 48 percent do not like the opt-out.) The divide in the country between those, on one hand, who want a guarantee of coverage for preexisting illnesses and favor funding Planned Parenthood, and on the other, those who take the opposite view, is not merely a Republican/Democratic divide. It’s a divide that runs through the House Republican conference. Freedom Caucus members often oppose legislation (as they did on the first Trumpcare effort), leaving a functional majority in the House (the rest of the GOP contingent and Democrats) and in the Senate (moderate Republicans and Democrats). That might explain why the GOP wish-list is proving so hard to check off.

We’re finally having the health-care debate we need,"Thanks to a horribly constructed Republican bill that satisfies no one and a late-night TV host, we are finally having the debate we need on health care. The Republicans who have for seven years promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act — but keep the parts they like such as protection for those with preexisting conditions — are now scrambling to pass a bill that does not really do either. Faced with the prospect of actually passing a bill and its impact on tens of millions of people, the GOP realized it couldn’t really repeal Obamacare. In its first iteration, the American Health Care Act left in place many Obamacare requirements, such as the essential level of benefits insurance plans must offer. More important, at least in principle, Republicans insisted they were committed to access to health care for everyone, a permanent and substantial federal guarantee. It may have been poorly designed, shortchanged rural and elderly Americans, rolled back Medicaid and handed the very rich a huge tax break, but it wasn’t really repeal of Obamacare. [Trump’s nifty plan to spend more and hurt poor people more — at the same time!] In its latest version, Republicans still don’t really repeal all of Obamacare, but now the promise of protection for preexisting conditions is undermined by states’ ability to opt out. But they said they’d keep protection for preexisting conditions! Sorry, they decided not to. But, but, what about “high-risk pools” — the supposed magic solution to protect people with preexisting conditions without imposing a community rating system? Well, House Speaker Paul Ryan’s and other Republicans’ bluff has been called: These things don’t work because they are horribly expensive and run out of money. As the AHCA teeters on the brink of failure, some Republicans ask if maybe the federal government could guarantee the high-risk pool be funded. Thunk. Well, now we’re really not abandoning the ACA’s universal coverage concept or “re-establishing an individual health-care market.” And if you are going to have to guarantee funding for high-risk pools (an uncapped entitlement, if you will), then you might just as well allow people with preexisting conditions to stay in the general individual policy market with the promise they won’t be charged more than others — which is exactly what Obamacare does. In or out of the main individual health-care market, they are going to need to have affordable coverage; that’s what the public wants and what the GOP now must grapple with. Moreover, as the Republicans struggle to find a mechanism to bolster high-risk pools, they confirm the underlying problem, namely that they run out of money. A possible $8 billion infusion over 5 years from the feds won’t come close to making sure the pools are funded. Experts say that would take as much as $30 billion per year. And if it costs more, will the Republicans provide, in essence, a new funding stream — a new entitlement in effect? [Republicans just hatched a last-ditch strategy to destroy Obamacare. It’s a total scam.] How did Republicans get so muddled? They wanted to repeal Obamacare but not force voters to suffer the consequences — e.g., loss of essential benefits, protection for preexisting conditions. To paraphrase President Trump, they want to have their cake — a beautiful piece of delicious chocolate cake — and eat it, too. They have essentially conceded the public will not stand for true repeal of the ACA, so they are forced to create a crazy quilt of fixes that duplicate Obamacare’s results. Those fixes are unsatisfying and ineffective, so you wind up with a bill no one likes and many people hate. And this brings us to Jimmy Kimmel. He, in essence, explained why it is now politically impossible to really repeal Obamacare and why politicians now must accede to the demand for universal coverage, not just theoretical access to health insurance. In an emotional monologue about his infant son’s heart defect, he told the crowd: We were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world, but until a few years ago millions and millions of us had no access to health insurance at all. You know, before 2014 if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you’d never be able to get health insurance because you had a preexisting condition. You were born with a preexisting condition and if your parents didn’t have medical insurance you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a preexisting condition. If your baby is going to die and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make. Whatever your party, whatever you believe, whoever you support, we need to make sure that the people who are supposed to represent us, people who are meeting about this right now in Washington, understand that very clearly. Let’s stop with the nonsense. This isn’t football. There are no teams. We are the team. It’s the United States. Don’t let their partisan squabbles divide us on something every decent person wants. We need to take care of each other Republicans should hide under their desks after that recitation. No doubt 99 percent of Americans agree with Kimmel. Hence, Republicans are trapped. They cannot repeal Obamacare and substitute merely the promise of access; they have to make certain there is coverage for all the infants, children and adults who otherwise would not have insurance. Obamacare moved the goalposts, or rather, acceded to a public demand that we not have anyone who would lack coverage and the peace of mind that goes along with it. [Jimmy Kimmel’s heartfelt plea just unmasked Trump’s moral bankruptcy] Sorry, Republicans, but it is no longer politically viable to offer merely theoretical access. Public expectations have changed, and politicians are not willing to face the onslaught of ads featuring parents like Kimmel. That means they cannot remove the federal government from the health-care equation or do away with actual protection for preexisting conditions. They could — but they’d lose their seats. They know that, which is why it becomes more unlikely every day that we’ll see something approaching a repeal of Obamacare. Republicans now are watching from a defensive crouch the real debate about health care play out: Are we as a society willing to say the federal government should not be guaranteeing coverage for just about everyone? Judging from the reaction to Kimmel, the answer is no. Republicans have been preaching something that was unattainable and unwanted for seven years. Maybe it is now time to move on to tax reform.

The mercurial Trump is giving Republicans whiplash," In the space of a single day, President Trump went from blaming the filibuster for the crummy five-month spending deal to declaring it a “win.” At a hastily arranged news conference, Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, was supposed to be spinning this as a win . However, he said explicitly what many had surmised: “I think the president is frustrated with the fact that he negotiated in good faith with the Democrats, and they went out to try and spike the football and make him look bad.” (In other words, the thin-skinned president’s ego was bruised, so he lashed out, suggesting that the Constitution needed to be changed so that he would not be out-negotiated again.) With a budget director like that, who needs political enemies, right? As for his filibuster idea, it was quickly shot down by Senate heavyweights, including the majority leader and the whip — Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.). It was a fleeting but telling example of how Republicans are unable to conceal their contempt for Trump’s harebrained ideas. With no basis, Mulvaney also insisted that Democrats “wanted a shutdown. We know that. They were desperate to make this administration look like we couldn’t function, like we couldn’t govern.” Umm, but then why wouldn’t a shutdown in September, which Trump seemed to be rooting for, also make it “look like we couldn’t function”? The episode illustrated several troubling trends for Republicans. First, the president is so mercurial that his party leaders dare not say anything or vote on anything controversial for fear of being undercut. The whirlwind of confusion he creates may have worked in business (or not, because we really don’t know how successful he is), but in government it can paralyze allies and give adversaries every reason to hold out for the deal that they want. (Think about the Iranians capitalizing on U.S. negotiators’ desperation for a nuclear deal.) Second, the difference between a deal that is so awful that it necessitates a revision of the Constitution and one that is a “win” has nothing to do with substance. None of what Trump proposes or advocates seems to matter on the merits. Trumpcare has extra protections for people with preexisting conditions — or maybe weaker ones. Whatever. Does the speaker have the votes? As when Mulvaney confessed that the president held back funding for miners’ benefits to get something in the deal (what he got isn’t clear), when a president advertises his concern only about himself and chalking up wins, he winds up affirming his enemies’ accusations that he is thoughtless, indifferent to others and not even embarrassed to admit his own callousness. Third, Mulvaney, a former Freedom Caucus member, lacks the gravitas to do his job. When he exclaims that the deal was a “tremendous development for the president and a huge win from a negotiating standpoint,” one has to laugh. In the past, OMB directors such as George P. Shultz, Leon Panetta, Alice Rivlin, Mitch Daniels and Rob Portman were sober, credible figures who could engender the confidence of both parties. Mulvaney plainly does not, and only amplifies Trump’s penchant for ludicrous hyperbole. The spending bill deal should not be an encouraging sign for Republicans as they look ahead (if they ever get over health care) to tax reform. They cannot rely on the support of the president even if his staff is involved in a deal. Trump seems not to notice or care when he is caught saying contradictory things (Bad deal! No, a win!) in the space of a few hours. And worst of all, he will settle for anything — and now Democrats know it.

Morning Bits,"Is President Trump winning yet? “The revamped Republican push for a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s health-care system ran into a new roadblock on Tuesday when a key lawmaker, Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), said he would vote against the current proposal.” Trump’s not going to win that argument. “GOP senators reject Trump’s call to end the filibuster.” This could be a win for Heritage if it replaces him with a respected scholar. “Jim DeMint resigned from his post as president of the conservative Heritage Foundation in the wake of a unanimous vote of its board of trustees on Tuesday.” A letter from 40-plus Republicans on the Hill protesting his departure underscores that it’s become a political, not scholarly, enterprise. Making a third run at Trumpcare was not a winning strategy. “At least 21 House Republicans have now said they oppose the latest version of the Republican plan to overhaul the health-care system, with an almost equal number publicly undecided on the bill. House GOP leaders can likely lose only 22 GOP votes to pass the bill, because it isn’t expected to receive any Democratic support. … Tuesday morning, Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.), a former House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman who is widely respected among House Republicans, told a Michigan radio station he couldn’t support the bill in its current form.” Ouch. Here’s the hard part of constructing a winning formula for encouraging work: “[A] key part of access [to jobs] is what some people call ‘soft” or ‘non-cognitive’ skills. These aren’t about ability in, say, math or reading; they instead reflect the personal capacities that precede work or shape how people engage with work. It can be useful to think of non-cognitive skills as a package since they are related and can be mutually reinforcing; some people refer to that package as ‘character.’ ” Read the whole thing. Score a win for Senate Democrats in insisting she testify. “Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates is prepared to testify before a Senate panel next week that she gave a forceful warning to the White House regarding then-National Security Advisor Michael Flynn nearly three weeks before he was fired, contradicting the administration’s version of events, sources familiar with her account tell CNN.” I’m not sure if this will win elections, but it could be quite amusing. Michael Moore: “ ‘The final thing that I have pushed is we need an army of satire,’ Moore said. ‘We need everybody to use their sense of humor and their comedy to bring him down. Because his skin is so thin, he gets so upset at, you know, all Melissa McCarthy has to do is keep appearing and Alec Baldwin on SNL and, you know, basically, I and others, we formed this larger group of discombobulating him with humor, ridicule, satire — we want him up at three in the morning tweeting. The more he is doing that, that’s the less he is doing to hurt the country.’ ” He’s actually right!

Why Trump is pouting," President Trump, in a series of tweets, complained that the filibuster is responsible for the failure to get his agenda through. As criticism from Republicans over a rotten spending deal increases, Trump declares: The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there! We either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good “shutdown” in September to fix mess! This follows a Fox News interview in which he complained, “We don’t have a lot of closers in politics, and I understand why: It’s a very rough system. It’s an archaic system.” He seemed to be blaming the deal on the potential for a filibuster, which in turn necessitates getting 60 votes, including Democrats, to pass legislation: “You can’t go through a process like this. It’s not fair. It forces you to make bad decisions. I mean, you’re really forced into doing things that you would normally not do except for these archaic rules.” It wasn’t clear at the time whether he was referring to the entire Constitution or just the filibuster. Both parties have vowed not to change the legislative filibuster after ending it for Supreme Court justices. Trump’s staff was fully involved in negotiating a deal. It’s odd that the man who reportedly told historian Jon Meacham “a year ago that he thought he could have done a deal to have averted the [Civil] War” would find negotiating a simple budget deal so perplexing. If Republicans got blamed in 2013 for a shutdown when President Barack Obama was president, imagine what the voters’ reaction would be when they fail to keep the government going with a Republican president, a Republican House and a Republican Senate. No other president had to demand abolition of the filibuster to get an acceptable budget. Trump is obviously embarrassed by a deal he likely didn’t focus on, didn’t know the details of and didn’t think was all that important. (It’s surprising he did not blame “fake news” for his crummy deal.) At any rate, his threat of a shutdown in the fall is an interesting one. With control of both houses and the White House, voters might find it hard to understand why they could not keep the government running. Republicans in Congress during the recent negotiations understood full well that the public wouldn’t tolerate a shutdown, so it’s not clear Republicans would be willing to hold out for a set of demands so extreme as to force a shutdown. While Trump might favor it for his own ego and Stephen K. Bannon might like creating chaos, the effort might have dire consequences for the markets and in turn for Republicans. “A ‘good shutdown’ sounds about as useful as a good car crash,” remarked former Obama administration economist Jared Bernstein. “It took them a while, but markets seem to have finally realized that they should heavily discount about 99.6 percent of what Trump says.” Indeed, as Trumpcare stalled, Trump’s tax “plan” drew guffaws and a mediocre budget deal emerged, the markets seem to have been in the mode of a course correction. The Wall Street Journal reported last week: “The hyped-up tax plan disappointed investors not because of what it contained, but because of the prospects of it being implemented. The White House seems to have made little effort to appeal to Democrats and none at all to make the plan acceptable Republican deficit hawks.” Markets are only now recognizing what political-watchers outside the Trump cult have known for a while: He’s an incompetent braggart. (“Mr. Trump had vowed in his first 100 days to fight for the passage of 10 broad legislative measures, including the repeal of the health law, the infrastructure package, middle-class tax relief, lower corporate tax rates and new child-care and elder-care tax deductions,” the Journal noted. “None of the 10 has passed Congress.”) A shutdown would confirm investors’ worst fear as well as voters’ suspicion — that Republicans cannot govern. In that case, the Trump era and Republican House and Senate majorities may vanish sooner than his opponents ever dreamed. UPDATE: Democrats chided the president for his remarks. On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) declared, “When the president threw cold water on this deal, and actually recommended a government shutdown — I was deeply disappointed. … The president has been complaining about the lack of bipartisanship in Washington. Well, this deal is exactly how Washington should work when it is bipartisan: Both parties negotiated and came to an agreement on a piece of legislation that we can each support. It is truly a shame that the president is degrading it because he didn’t get 100 percent of what he wanted.” He added, “Bipartisanship is best summed up by the Rolling Stones, ‘You can’t always get what you want.’ ” Rep. Nita M. Lowey (N.Y.), ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, put out a terse statement: “President Trump’s statement advocating a government shutdown is reckless and irresponsible. … I urge President Trump to consider being a constructive part of our government’s spending decisions, rather than a destabilizing influence.” Good luck with that, Congresswoman Lowey.

Why the GOP health-care bill looks like a loser — again,"The Hill reports: Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) said Monday that he opposes the revised GOP ObamaCare replacement bill because it weakens protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Long’s announcement was unexpected, and a bad sign for GOP leaders looking to round up enough votes to be able to pass the measure as soon as this week. Long was not on the radar as a possible no vote. This confirms a few observations, none of which bodes well for House Republicans. First, the decision to allow states to opt out of the community rating provision (in effect, allowing insurers to charge people with preexisting conditions more) is a big deal that unnerved many House members. For moderates, the change made the bill worse. And, as Long suggests, it may not have helped keep mainstream Republicans together. The way these things work is that a prominent defection usually spurs a flood more. Second, President Trump couldn’t get the ball across the end line last time on Trumpcare and instead wound up alienating some key Republicans. This time around, Trump insisted that the bill was still changing (so why agree to the current version?) and would guarantee coverage for those with preexisting conditions. He demonstrated that at any moment he can undercut whatever compromise Republicans are considering. The president has no bottom line or ideological compass; that leaves members unable to figure out where he is going to wind up. Imagine if President Barack Obama had given Democrats the idea that he might not like their end product. They’d never have passed a bill. After getting burned once or twice, GOP lawmakers will become gun-shy about taking votes on anything controversial. Third, Long’s “surprise” suggests that the House leadership doesn’t really know how many votes it has. That’s peculiar for legislation so important for the GOP. It reminds us how grievous an error it was not to build support patiently through a legislative process, as Democrats did for Obamacare over 11 months. Had they gone the long, patient route, Republicans would have resolved objections and gotten lawmakers to buy in as the process went along. Instead, they now are compelled to present one ultimatum after another to members. Having refused to include everyone in the crafting of legislation, GOP leaders are left to guess how each iteration will go down. Apparently, their guesses are not all that accurate. Fourth, each time the Republicans suggest they have the votes and then back away, they rack up another loss. (They’re up to two.) It’s bad enough to fail on your No. 1 policy objective; it’s quite another to lose over and over on the same priority. With each failure, it becomes that much harder to pick up the pieces and try again. Fifth, Trump’s (and some Republicans’) insistence on doing health-care reform before tax reform made sense initially. GOP leaders wanted the revenue generated from repeal of Obamacare to help make up the shortfall that they’d create in tax reform. Now, however, they’ve demonstrated no appetite for any other fiscal restraint or concern about revenue neutrality in their tax plan. So why are they still hung up on health care? Most likely, Trump’s ego cannot accept a humiliating loss. He repeatedly goes back to the well with, so far, little to show for it. At some point, he’ll get tired of losing so much, one expects. And finally, the president’s insistence that the bill does protect people with preexisting condition by virtue of high-risk pools has called attention to the pools’ track record and considerable defects. Grouping people with potentially expensive health-care costs into one pool makes coverage, well, really expensive for those in the pool. States using pools in the past had to restrict coverage, create waiting lists (which grew longer and longer) and/or charge high premiums. Republicans have thrown out “high-risk pools” as an all-purpose alternative to Obamacare’s protections without examining their efficacy. (“State high-risk pools are a smarter way of guaranteeing coverage for people with preexisting conditions,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has often said.) In fact, they are no panacea, as McClatchy reported earlier in the year: “Most experts agree that the state-run pools were largely a failure, suffering from poor funding, which led to restrictions on enrollment and benefits along with higher premiums. Pool coverage costs were typically 50 to 100 percent above private market rates.” It’s estimated that $30 billion to $50 billion would be needed to fund the pools each year, a sum the GOP will never guarantee. Had the House gone through a careful policy process with complete hearings, perhaps Republicans might have learned that their “solution” to covering people with preexisting conditions was really no solution at all.

Jimmy Kimmel’s heartfelt plea just unmasked Trump’s moral bankruptcy,"THE MORNING PLUM: Social media is burning up over the heartfelt plea for universal health care that Jimmy Kimmel made on Monday night. Kimmel repeatedly teared up as he recounted the jarring discovery that his newborn baby has heart disease that required immediate surgery, and then pointed out that before Obamacare became law, people with preexisting conditions — such as his new baby — could eventually be denied health insurance. “We were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world, but until a few years ago, millions and millions of us had no access to health insurance at all,” Kimmel said. “If your baby is going to die, and it doesn’t have to, it shouldn’t matter how much money you make. I think that’s something now, whether you’re a Republican or Democrat, or something else, we all agree on that, right?” Some are hoping this powerful moment will shift the argument decisively against the GOP health-care bill, if it garners enough attention. But in one important sense, it is unlikely to do that — and this, I think, sheds new light on a profound problem at the core of our current health-care debate. The problem is not that Kimmel and President Trump fundamentally disagree over what our health system should look like and that Kimmel’s case will simply fail on the merits to persuade Trump to see things his way. No, the conundrum here is a good deal more confounding than that. It’s that Trump has persuaded himself that his plan would accomplish what Kimmel wants far more effectively than Obamacare would — in other words, that Trumpcare would be far better for people like Kimmel’s son than Obamacare has been, even by the lights of Kimmel himself. It’s hard to gauge whether this belief is rooted in even any effort at empirical analysis. He may have merely persuaded himself that whatever he signs simply must be better in all ways than Obamacare ever was, because otherwise he wouldn’t put the great Trump name on it. But the effect is that pleas such as that from Kimmel probably cannot penetrate his thinking at all. This conclusion is very hard to avoid when you read the newly posted transcript of Bloomberg’s interview with Trump on Monday. In it, Trump suddenly said the GOP health bill is only a work in progress and that the final bill will be “every bit as good on preexisting conditions as Obamacare.” In reality, the current GOP bill guts protections for preexisting conditions. It allows states to waive the ban on jacked-up premiums on people who suffer from them — provided that states set up another mechanism such as “high-risk pools,” which historically have been plagued by under-funding, soaring costs and people going without coverage. Thus, the GOP bill could drive up sick people’s premiums astronomically and drive many out of the market. But it is unclear whether Trump fully grasps that the GOP bill does these things, or the consequences they might have. In the Bloomberg interview, Trump was repeatedly pressed on whether the bill will protect people with preexisting conditions, and again and again, he fell back on the argument that it will be better on this front than Obamacare is, mainly because Obamacare is a disaster, and no more needs to be said. It’s as if this is all he really needs to know about the bill that will one day bear his mighty signature. In his Sunday interview on CBS, Trump showed a bit of awareness of the debate, referring to the “pools” in his plan, but he falsely equated this with a guarantee of protection for people with preexisting conditions. Conservatives have long complained — understandably — that Trump secretly supports a far more robust government role in expanding coverage to the poor and sick than they do. And in the abstract, he may. In the Bloomberg interview, he says that he wants people to be taken care of and that his plan does this. If we take him at his word — if we assume he really wants this and believes his plan would do it — then this topic cannot be meaningfully debated at all. The dispute is not over whether people with preexisting conditions should be guaranteed access to coverage — which he says he believes — but rather over whether under his plan they actually will get this guarantee. But such a debate with Trump is beyond reach. In fact, some Republicans know this is not the case. Some oppose the plan because it will not be nearly as good for people with preexisting conditions, as a candid statement from Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) explains well. Even Republicans who support Trumpcare understand this (though they are not always candid about it), but they genuinely believe the Affordable Care Act’s protections are not worth trade-offs they require. With those Republicans, we can at least debate this topic. We can argue that we think the trade-offs required for achieving those protections — and the ACA’s historic coverage expansion more generally — are worth it. But we can’t have this debate with Trump, because his plan, by definition, simply must be infinitely better than Obamacare and far more terrific for everyone, in every conceivable way. So there’s no obvious way Kimmel that could change Trump’s mind — no matter how powerful his plea. *************************************************************************** * GOP STILL LACKS VOTES FOR HEALTH BILL: HuffPost’s Matt Fuller reports that House Republicans were still struggling to round up votes to pass repeal-and-replace, as of late last night: Support among the rank-and-file is squishy and opposition among moderates doesn’t look any less fierce than days before … Even some GOP deputy whips … David Valadao (R-Calif.), Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Kevin Yoder (R-Kan.), and Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.) … all reported Monday that they hadn’t made up their minds. Fuller’s latest whip count: 19 Republicans look firmly against it; nine are leaning No; and more are undecided. The Hill’s count is at 21 committed No votes. Both are close to the 23 No votes needed to derail the bill. * KEEP AN EYE ON VULNERABLE REPUBLICANS: The Washington Examiner reports that those House Republicans who are holding out against the GOP bill tend to be from districts that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump carried only narrowly: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce is a new addition to the ranks of the official undecideds. [His] district voted for Clinton over Trump by a 51.5 percent to 43 percent margin … Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., is another red flag … Diaz-Balart is unsure of his vote … Voting for the AHCA in its present form could be a problem for him in 2018 in a district that only voted narrowly for Trump over Clinton, 49.6 percent to 47.9 percent. They know Democrats are eager to attack them for gutting protections for preexisting conditions — and that they’d be risking their careers to back something with little chance in the Senate. * GOP SENATOR EXPRESSES SKEPTICISM OF HOUSE BILL: The bill would permit states to allow jacked-up premiums on preexisting conditions, if states set up high-risk pools for them. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) suggests that this breaks a Trump promise: Cassidy was skeptical of the modified AHCA, which creates high-risk pools for people with preexisting conditions. “I suspect the advocates for the bill will say that’s their guarantee,” he said. “I will insist that the president’s pledges be met. And the president pledged that he would take care of people with preexisting conditions.” Even if the House bill does pass the lower chamber, this is an early sign of what will happen to it in the Senate. * DEMS TO UNLEASH MAJOR AD BLITZ IN GEORGIA: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Democrat Jon Ossoff is preparing to unleash a $5.2 million blitz of ads in the special election for a House seat in the Atlanta suburbs. The spending is meant to counter millions of dollars that conservative and Republican groups are pouring into the battle. The massive amounts raised by Ossoff are a sign of the extraordinary energy that is animating Democrats right now, and a victory here could help sustain that heading into 2018. One recent internal Democratic poll has the race as a dead heat. * TRUMP AFFECTION FOR STRONGMEN ALARMS RIGHTS ADVOCATES: The Post reports that human rights advocates are increasingly worried about Trump’s praise of totalitarian leaders and strongmen, because it is emerging as a meaningful pattern: In an undeniable shift in American foreign policy, Trump is cultivating authoritarian leaders, one after another, in an effort to reset relations following an era of ostracism and public shaming by Obama and his predecessors … Trump has willingly turned a blind eye to dictators’ records of brutality and oppression in hopes that those leaders might become his partners in isolating North Korea or fighting terrorism. As The Post’s story notes, Trump has yet to use the power of his office to “champion human rights and democratic values around the world.” * HISTORIANS GRAPPLE WITH TRUMP’S LATEST: Trump continues to defend his suggestion that Andrew Jackson might have stopped the Civil War if he’d been president at the time, tweeting: “Would never let it happen.” Historian Jon Meacham has this rejoinder: “The expansion of slavery caused the Civil War. And you can’t get around that. So what does Trump mean? Would he have let slavery exist but not expand? That’s the counterfactual question you have to ask.” I think Trump really means that Trump would never have let it happen and that Trump would have averted the Civil War while ending slavery, through his combination of toughness and savvy dealmaking. * AND THE TRUMPISM OF THE DAY, DEARTH OF A SALESMAN EDITION: Axios reports on a phone call that a House Republican claims he had with Trump: During a recent phone conversation about the evolving health-reform bill, President Trump asked a simplistic but apparently sincere question: “Is what we are going to do going to take care of people? What I told people is: We’ll take care of people.” No deep dive on the detail. But Trump, the salesman, wanted reassurance selling a big, complicated product he doesn’t fully understand. It’s not clear whether Trump meant to ask whether the GOP bill actually takes care of people or whether it can be sold that way. It’s also not clear he appreciates the difference.

Trump guarantees protection for those with preexisting medical conditions — but it’s unclear how,"President Trump tried Sunday to reassure anxious Republicans that the latest proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act would continue to protect those with preexisting medical conditions, although he struggled to fully articulate what form those protections would take. As Republicans have tried to find a health-care bill on which they can reach a consensus, Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) agreed to support an amendment that would allow insurance providers in some states to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with preexisting conditions or costly health problems, as long as that state set up “high-risk pools” that could instead help cover the cost of care.  Proponents say this would lower premiums for healthy individuals, but critics say it would dramatically drive up costs for those who are seriously ill. Democrats, along with many Republicans, have argued that the popular preexisting protections should stay as they are. In an interview with CBS News's “Face the Nation” that aired Sunday morning, Trump said “this bill has evolved” over the past several weeks and will “beautifully” protect those who have preexisting medical conditions. He highlighted the proposal to set up high-risk pools — but he also repeatedly seemed to suggest continuing the current mandate. “Preexisting conditions are in the bill — and I mandate it. I said, 'Has to be,' Trump said"
Trump undercuts the latest Trumpcare effort," On Sunday, President Trump told John Dickerson on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that any health-care bill he would support would “guarantee” protection for people with preexisting conditions. “Preexisting conditions are in the bill,” he declared. “And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be.’ ” Politico, like a number of outlets, pointed out that this is a “shift from language in the Republican replacement bill circulating in the House.” That will surprise Republicans whipping the vote. (CNN noted, “The amendment would allow states to seek waivers to weaken several key Obamacare insurance reforms that protect those with pre-existing conditions, including the benefits insurers must cover in their policies and the ban on allowing carriers to charge more based on a person’s health background.”) Moreover, Trump suggested that the bill is still changing. This, too, should come as a shock to House Republicans, who thought they reached a final deal last week that gives states the right to opt out of several of the Obamacare protections. It is not clear if Trump is confused about what is in the bill or thinks the negotiations should continue until his “mandate” (which is the Obamacare mandate, to be clear) is secured. If what he is referring to is the provision that says states can opt out of equal treatment for those with preexisting conditions (so-called community ratings), then the amendment authored by Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) fails. Their amendment says that states can opt out of the protection for preexisting coverage if they have a so-called high-risk pool. But there is no limit on what those pools can charge, nor is there a federal guarantee of funding. (The bill provides $15 billion but does not say what happens if that money runs out.) Trump also insists that premiums will go down. (In Trumpcare, many of Trump’s own voters — older and rural Americans — will pay more.) Perhaps if aides put a map in front of him, as they did with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), showing how many of his supporters would be adversely affected, he would change his mind. To be fair, Trump is not the only Republican confused about high-risk pools. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) often asserts that high-risk pools are the solution to coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. Nothing in the experience of these pools suggests that this is the case, however. Kaiser Health News reported last November: More than half of state high-risk insurance pools have closed in the past few years, according to data from the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans (NASCHIP). In other state-run high-risk pools, new enrollment has stopped and overall participation has dropped, the data showed. Premiums ranged from 125% to 200% of the average individual market rate in a given state, according to NASCHIP. … “High-risk pools segregate sick people into plans that are more expensive to both the government and the individual,” said Anthony Wright of Health Access, a coalition of consumer advocates. Wright said the high-risk pools were among the “failures” in the health care system that led to Obamacare. The experience in California was illustrative. Not only did costs soar, but also gigantic waiting lists formed and the coverage included many limitations that Obamacare currently prohibits (e.g. annual and lifetime limits). Now if you mandated that the pools could not charge more than the average rate in the state and provided a funding stream to guarantee coverage, that would be a different matter. But it would also be ferociously expensive, and in the language of Obamacare critics, set up a “new entitlement.” House Republicans and the president do not appear to be on the same page. If Trump “mandates” protection for preexisting conditions and says his bill must lower premiums, the latest bill does not do it. Someone should tell the president — or tell House Republicans to keep negotiating.

This is not a normal president,"Republican consultant Ana Navarro on CNN’s State of the Union aptly summarized events on Saturday: “You had Trump, President Trump in Pennsylvania, speaking to his base, feeding red meat to the base and being divisive. You had the press celebrating the press standing up for journalism and you had the resistance marching in sweltering heat in Washington for climate change and against Trump.” It’s normal for activists to march in favor of their causes (climate change was the issue this week). It’s certainly normal for the press to defend the First Amendment. What is not normal is for the president on his 100th day in office to rant and rave about the media in a campaign-style screed. It’s not normal for the president of the United States and leader of the Free World to declare: “Media outlets like CNN and MSNBC are fake news. . . .  They are a disgrace.” It’s not normal for a president to stand in front of a crowd citing poll ratings — about the press. And it’s sure not normal to read the poem “The Snake” to describe illegal immigrants. [Why did Trump win? New research by Democrats offers a worrying answer.] President Trump remains an angry, irrational figure, someone who still must stir up hatred — against the press, against immigrants, against Democrats — to enliven his base. Rhetorically, he is still the candidate of the resentful America First crowd, not the president of the entire country. His rambling, incoherent and factually deficient remarks in Harrisburg, Pa., remind us of the pathetic emptiness of the message — I’m with you because I hate the same people you do. It’s not normal to rack up a record 488 falsehoods in the first 100 days in office and to repeat the same falsehoods over and over again. It’s not normal for a president to continue to question a foreign power’s responsibility for its well-documented, comprehensive effort to sway our elections. Yes, he is still doing that despite what all his national security advisers tell him. It’s not normal for the public to doubt whether Trump even knows what is in his own proposals. He insists Trumpcare protects preexisting conditions. He claims his taxes would go up under his plan, which lowers his rate to 15 percent (he’s a Svengali of pass-through companies) and abolishes the alternative minimum tax. It’s not normal for a president to be surprised that health care is complicated or being president isn’t easy. [How Trump makes it impossible for Republicans to win policy debates] It’s not normal for a U.S. president to praise and congratulate dictatorial leaders, as he does with President Xi Jinping of China (“a very good man”) and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. (Good men do not lock up political dissidents.) Normal presidents do not go out of their way to cheer the leader of the National Front, a party that is still infested with anti-Semites and whose leader denied the role of France in the murder of French Jews during WWII. It’s not normal to invite for a White House visit a human-rights abuser and anti-American demagogue who has presided over thousands of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. (Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley at her confirmation hearing correctly described extrajudicial killings under Rodrigo Duterte as a gross abuse of human rights.) And yet Republicans in Congress and in the commentariat ignore, minimize or don’t care about all that. Great job! Give him an A! Hey, there’s Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, you know! Whatever standards — Constitutional, personal, ideological — Republicans once upheld have been thrown overboard. They cannot bring themselves to enforce the emoluments clause or compel Trump to disclose his taxes or crack down on the blatant conflicts of interest throughout his administration. During the first 100 days the Republic has survived, but the GOP, permanently we think, has been morally compromised and intellectually corrupted, just as many of us warned. “Everything Trump touches dies,” GOP consultant Rick Wilson is fond of saying. Trump’s victims now include a respectable Republican Party.
