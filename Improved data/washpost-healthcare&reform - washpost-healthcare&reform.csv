Rand Paul calls out hypocrisy of GOP in the Trump era,"The latest politico pointing out just how much the Republican Party has changed under President Trump comes from the inside. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) delayed a Senate vote past midnight Thursday to mark his opposition to an estimated $320 billion addition to the federal budget deficit — something he called Republicans out for supporting: “If you were against President Obama's deficits, and now you're for the Republican deficits, isn't that the very definition of hypocrisy?” Paul, known for his libertarian leanings, said the budget deal breaks past Republican pledges to rein in federal spending. After GOP leaders refused to allow Paul to offer an amendment, he chose to use a Senate rule that allows individual senators to slow down proceedings that require the consent of all. “I can’t in all good honesty, in all good faith, just look the other way because my party is now complicit in the deficits,” he said on the Senate floor. [The Daily 202: Rand Paul's short-lived shutdown is ending, but his warning about GOP deficit hypocrisy reverberates] Paul ran against Trump in the 2016 presidential primary, drawing attention to the president’s multiple bankruptcies as proof of his lack of a commitment to fiscal conservatism. When Trump pulled out of a January 2016 Fox News debate because the network declined his request to remove Megyn Kelly as moderator, Paul claimed that Trump might be backing away because the former Democrat isn’t a conservative. He told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota: “Maybe [he's] afraid of the fact that he's never voted in a Republican presidential primary. For 70 years, he's been a progressive Democrat. I was wondering if maybe he's going to show up for the Democrat primary debate next time.” “I think he does want to avoid difficult questions. And I think he's used to getting his way,” Paul added. Paul has since been seen buddying up with Trump on the golf course. But his strongest words late into the night Thursday were for his fellow party members who attacked President Barack Obama for increased government spending but are now are rallying behind a similar idea just because it's championed by Republican lawmakers. Paul said: “I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits. Now we have Republicans hand in hand with Democrats offering us trillion-dollar deficits. I can't in all honesty look the other way.” Congress ended a five-hour government shutdown early Friday morning after the House supported a massive bipartisan budget deal that adds hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending. The funds will go to the military, domestic programs and disaster relief. Trump signed the bill into law Friday morning. Under Trump, fiscally conservative lawmakers supported increased government spending. Under Trump, the Republican National Committee backed a candidate in Alabama accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls while in his 30s. Under Trump, Christian conservatives have defended a thrice-married man against allegations that his lawyer paid a six-figure settlement to a porn actress who reportedly had an affair with the president not long after his wife gave birth to their son. Under Trump, multiple veterans have backed a candidate with multiple draft deferments who as president has invoked the military while attacking other Americans who took a knee during the national anthem to protest racism and police violence. Under Trump, Republicans who criticized the influence of high-spending donors in politics have gone silent as the billionaire president's private club hosts political fundraisers with tickets starting at $100,000. Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman told the New York Times that people like her who boarded the Trump train called themselves Trumpublicans due to his unorthodox and unconventional approach to politics that seemed to have no place in the Democratic Party or the GOP. But more than a year after Trump’s inauguration, it is clear that his politics have found a home in the GOP. The majority of Republicans continue to give him high approval ratings despite scandals dominating headlines nearly every week. They point to the decisions that reflect a relatively traditional Republican presidency as reasons for their high support. But a sizable group of Never Trump Republicans remains vocal and critical of his presidency. And it is not clear where these conservatives can go, given that Trumpism is becoming more of the dominant worldview of the GOP. Paul is likely to continue to draw attention to what he sees as hypocrisies in the Republican Party, but the likelihood of conservative lawmakers pivoting away to the traditional vision of conservatism is low. The truth is conservative voters had a chance to choose between Paul and Trump’s visions for America during the GOP primaries. The GOP chose Trump. "
Sen. Orrin Hatch on President Trump's appointments to the judiciary,"The office of Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) passed along this item, which I thought would be very interesting for our readers, as it tells us something about how Republicans are continuing to argue about judicial appointments; naturally, if a Democratic senator wants to pass along something similar from the other side, I’d love to publish it as well: In Washington, it can sometimes be difficult to focus on what counts. Today’s information environment is increasingly atomized and persistently polarized. Almost all will inevitably focus on who is up, and who is down, in the endless cycle of partisan gamesmanship. But none should forget that what matters, at the end of the day, is policy. And the first year of new Republican government has delivered plenty of that. Here in the Senate, despite fits and starts, we are moving the ball forward. Notwithstanding often vicious treatment by the media and the constant obstruction of the Democrats here in Congress, President Trump is managing his domestic policy agenda like a true leader does: he names his agenda, he picks his team, and he executes. The results speak for themselves. We are closing in on a historic tax reform package, which itself includes an important first step on healthcare reform. Regulatory burdens are falling, as the administrative state faces its first substantial pushback in decades. From labor to environmental to fiscal and monetary policy, from education to justice issues, there’s substantial progress on nearly every front. Only a year into the new administration, we are making good on the pledge for a historic change in Washington. But, of course, there is perhaps no greater legacy that a President leaves behind than the judicial appointments he makes. President Trump’s choices there will echo for generations. Further, there was perhaps no more distinguishing promise that then-candidate Trump made to the American people than the restoration of the judiciary. And thus, it is particularly gratifying to recognize that in no area have promises made more fully ripened into promises kept. Neil Gorsuch was a superb choice for the Supreme Court. At a historic juncture for our courts, he stands poised to seize the mantle left by Justice Antonin Scalia, and carry the cause of originalism and textualism forward for a new generation. But Justice Gorsuch was only the beginning. From the circuits courts to the district courts, judicial nominations, across the board, have been outstanding. The results will be felt for decades to come. From the outset, President Trump has brought to this process the same acumen and drive that made him so successful in business. First, he has clearly named his agenda: a judiciary recommitted to the impartial administration of justice and refocused on the rule of law. Second, he has wisely picked his team: White House Counsel Don McGahn and his staff have been, in a word, exceptional. And third, the President is executing flawlessly: as a former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I can say confidently that we’ve never seen such a high-quality stable of nominees, and nominated at such a rapid pace. As is not much of a secret in Washington these days, Republicans tend to disagree among themselves quite a bit. Through the effort to deliver on our promises to the American people, there will be differences of opinion on the best policy means to reach shared policy goals. But one thing that continues to unify the Conference here in the Senate, and Republicans across the country, is the conviction that an independent, impartial judiciary is simply too important to lose. And that is why, whatever our differences on other issues, conservatives across the board heartily approve of the way this administration has handled judicial nominations. I’ll continue to work with my colleagues here in the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as Leader McConnell, to confirm these judges. As the rest of our agenda gains steam, judicial selection will remain the vanguard. Through the 2016 campaign, the President promised to pull the best people onto his team, and to deliver real results for the American people. On judicial nominations, that’s precisely what he is doing. By installing and empowering such a capable White House Counsel’s office, he has signaled the seriousness with which he takes this effort. And by keeping up the pace of nominations, he has assured that this enormous opportunity for improvement in the judiciary will not go to waste. The product of the administration’s efforts, and the good that can still be done, will carve a defining legacy of which we can all be proud.

The Daily 202: John Kelly proves he can manage up on his first day as chief of staff,"Anthony Scaramucci talks on his cell phone in the rain as he boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base last Friday. He got forced out as White House communications director after just 10 days. (Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images) With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: John F. Kelly’s first move as White House chief of staff — firing communications director Anthony Scaramucci — validated President Trump’s decision to elevate him. The 67-year-old retired Marine general showed that he’s no nonsense, and the alpha male in the Oval Office surely appreciated the early show of strength. “Trump’s willingness to dismiss Scaramucci — whom he hired just 10 days ago — was viewed by many in the West Wing as an indication that he is eager to impose order and is giving Kelly the tools to do so,” Abby Phillip, John Wagner and Damian Paletta report. “Removing him from the communications post is part of an effort to change the culture of the White House.” It makes sense that Kelly axing someone as colorful as The Mooch would get the lion’s share of attention, but three other stories that came out in the past 24 hours also foreshadow what kind of chief he’ll be: 1. “A hint of Kelly’s potential influence on Trump emerged two weeks ago, in Aspen, Colorado, when Kelly made a startling revelation,” writes the New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza, the reporter who found himself on the receiving end of one of Scaramucci’s profanity-laced tirades last week: “According to several sources who attended a private briefing that included some of the nation’s most senior current and former national-security officials, Kelly sought to ease their minds about one of the most controversial and famous Trump proposals: the border wall with Mexico. Kelly explained that he had spent a great deal of time talking through the issue with Trump, and he believed he had convinced the President that he didn’t actually need to build a physical wall … To the officials in the room, it was a fascinating admission. Kelly seemed to be suggesting that he was one of the few people who might be able to tame Trump and get him to back off some of his most cartoonish policy ideas, even the ones that were core campaign promises.” 2. Kelly was so upset with how Trump handled the firing of FBI Director James Comey that he called Comey to say he was considering resigning, CNN reports: “Comey, who took Kelly's call while traveling back from Los Angeles to Washington, responded to Kelly by telling him not to resign … (Two) sources said Comey and Kelly are not close friends but that they had a professional relationship and a deep mutual respect for each other. … ‘John was angry and hurt by what he saw and the way (Comey) was treated,’ one of the sources said.” 3. Kelly is already making overtures to Democrats, per the Daily Beast: “Even before he formally started the job, Kelly was reaching out to top Capitol Hill Democrats in hopes of regaining political capital ahead of what is expected to be a bruising fight over tax reform and other administration priorities. ‘Tax reform is gonna be a heavy lift,’ a senior White House official [said]. ‘No reason to write off/alienate [Democrats] any more than we already have.’ A spokeswoman for … Nancy Pelosi [said] that Kelly reached out her over the weekend with the two holding a phone conversation on Sunday. A spokesman for … Chuck Schumer … confirmed that Kelly reached out to him as well.” UNDERSTANDING KELLY’S WORLD VIEW: -- The new chief of staff gave a fascinating 90-minute interview last July to Foreign Policy’s Molly O’Toole, in which he decried “the cesspool of domestic politics.” At a moment when Michael Flynn was being mentioned as a possible running mate for Trump, the recently retired general warned former brass to avoid wading into the 2016 campaign. “To join in the political fray, I don’t think it convinces anyone,” he said. “It just becomes a talking point on CNN.” “He said Clinton and Trump ‘are not serious yet about the issues’ and speak only in generalities when it comes to complex topics ranging from combating the Islamic State to handling the Syrian refugee crisis. The campaigns ‘don’t reflect reality.’ Kelly said he’d be willing to serve in either a Trump or Clinton White House but didn’t endorse either. Whomever wins, he added, ‘will be in desperate need — and I mean desperate need — of military and foreign policy advice, because the world out there is just getting crazier and crazier.’ … “The retired general said the anti-Islamic State fight will continue long after Obama — and probably his successor — leaves office, a grim reality that neither Clinton nor Trump seems eager to openly discuss. ‘You’re not going to win this thing by dropping bombs on these people,’ he said, adding that neither presidential candidate was willing to acknowledge that the sustained ‘victory’ they promise would likely require a large number of U.S. and coalition troops deployed to Iraq for decades to come.” John Kelly listens as Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting yesterday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER: -- Republican consultant Blain Rethmeier recalls a quote from Kelly during his confirmation hearing to run DHS: “I have never had a problem speaking truth to power, and I firmly believe that those in power deserve full candor and my honest assessment and recommendations.” “One reason the general's success can be expected to be repeated at the White House is his understanding of Sun Tzu's observation that ‘a leader leads by example — not by force,’” Rethmeier, who helped prepare Kelly for his hearing as a so-called sherpa, writes in an op-ed for the Washington Examiner. “He didn't mince words at his confirmation hearings in questioning the viability of the border wall or the wisdom of a complete Muslim ban, or in stressing the important role good relationships with Muslim clerics played in Iraq. I am convinced that Kelly will patiently explain to the president that he cannot go on undermining his own most loyal supporters in tweets (a la Attorney General Jeff Sessions), leaving the heavy lifting to others in achieving policy goals (Obamacare repeal), or allow open feuding among members of his leadership team. And he will insist on the power to ensure appropriate procedures are put in place to rein in the madness.” -- “As a former White House chief of staff, the best advice I could have given [Kelly] has been overtaken by events: Don’t take the job,” quips John Podesta, who held top positions in the Bill Clinton and Barack Obama administrations, in an op-ed for today’s paper. “Kelly, who has rendered extraordinary service and sacrifice to the nation, just signed up for what may truly be an impossible mission … To have any chance of succeeding, he will have to accomplish three extraordinary tasks, all at odds with President Trump’s instincts. First, discipline. … Kelly’s second task will be to restore strategic direction to Trump’s haphazard policy-making process. … Kelly’s third task might be the hardest. He has to protect the integrity and independence of the Justice Department and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation from constant interference by the president and the White House … “The truth is that the president needs Kelly more than Kelly needs him,” argues Podesta, who was chairman of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “Trump simply cannot afford to have Kelly walk without disastrous consequences. The new chief of staff should use that power to restore discipline and dignity to a White House sorely in need of both.” -- “In his 40 years in the military, Kelly developed a reputation for bluntness that won him the respect of his fellow Marines and sometimes grated on senior officials in the Obama administration,” Greg Jaffe and Andrew deGrandpre wrote in a profile over the weekend. “He is best known in Washington as an experienced battlefield commander who led U.S. troops in Iraq and lost a son in Afghanistan in 2010 to a Taliban bomb. But the most relevant experience he will bring to the chief of staff job is a tour as senior military adviser to Defense Secretaries Robert M. Gates and Leon E. Panetta in the Pentagon. The job demanded Kelly act as a disciplinarian, pressing to make sure the military service chiefs and the sprawling Pentagon bureaucracy were executing the defense secretary’s agenda … “As a four-star general, Kelly was frequently at odds with the Obama White House. He spoke out forcefully on issues including Obama’s plan to shutter the prison complex in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the perceived vulnerability of America’s borders. At a time when the Obama administration was trying to wind down America’s wars and calm fears of a terrorist attack, Kelly often spoke of the threat posed by groups like the Taliban in dire terms. … In charge of U.S. Southern Command, Kelly oversaw the military detention center at (Gitmo). His weekly updates on the prison, which were blasted out to dozens of White House and Pentagon officials, became well known for their candor. ‘His vernacular wasn’t the typical government prose,’ said one former White House official. ‘He would call out some of the military commission judges, saying that they had no idea what they were doing.’” -- At DHS, Kelly has demonstrated that he can be combative with lawmakers: Speaking in April at George Washington University, he said that congressional critics of the Department of Homeland Security should “shut up’’ and assume the agency is acting appropriately and following the law. “If lawmakers do not like the laws they’ve passed and we are charged to enforce, then they should have the courage and skill to change the laws,” Kelly said. “Otherwise they should shut up and support the men and women on the front lines.” Watch: HOW LONG WILL KELLY’S HONEYMOON LAST? -- “General Kelly has the full authority to operate within the White House, and all staff will report to him,” said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. -- It seems inevitable, though, that palace intrigue will continue, and that Trump’s kids will balk sooner than later at going through an intermediary to get to their dad. From Abby Phillip, John Wagner and Damian Paletta: “In one of the strongest indications that Kelly will have greater authority than his predecessor, Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner — both of whom advocated for Kelly to be hired — have expressed their willingness to support any structural changes Kelly might make … Sanders confirmed that they, too, will report to Kelly, as will all other officials. But Kelly is planning to bring at least one senior adviser from the Department of Homeland Security with him to the White House. There are signs that these new hires may be met with a chilly reception, two people familiar with the matter said, raising questions about who will hold influence in a White House overloaded with aides competing for influence. … Ivanka Trump and Kushner were instrumental in bringing Scaramucci into the White House in large part to oust (Reince) Priebus, who led the establishment wing. After Scaramucci’s explosive interview with the New Yorker … they soured on him and were supportive of Kelly’s efforts to oust him.” -- “The president gave Mr. Priebus many of the same assurances of control, and then proceeded to undercut and ignore him — to the point where Mr. Priebus often positioned himself at the door of the Oval Office to find out whom the president was talking to,” Michael Shear, Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman note on the front page of today’s New York Times. “Mr. Scaramucci’s fall and Mr. Kelly’s rise highlighted the diminished but still important role in shaping the West Wing played by (Ivanka and Jared) … Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner had hoped to persuade Mr. Trump to appoint Dina Powell, the deputy national security adviser, as chief of staff. Mr. Trump, who likes Ms. Powell, considered doing so … “For the time being, the White House may leave the communications director post open … though Mr. Kelly has the latitude from Mr. Trump to fill the post with someone from the Department of Homeland Security. Two perennial candidates to fill the post are Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser and the president’s former campaign manager, and Jason Miller, who held the communications post during the campaign. Mr. Trump has long wanted to bring Mr. Miller, who serves as an informal adviser, into the administration.” -- Given the origins of the role under Dwight D. Eisenhower, does a military background make one more likely to be a successful chief of staff? Chris Whipple spent five years interviewing 17 former White House chiefs of staff for his book about the history of the position (“The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency”): “I’ve spoken to a few former White House chiefs who have not heard from him, interestingly, which is not a good sign,” he told Amy B Wang. “Most incoming White House chiefs would be working the phones to their predecessors and it doesn’t sound like he’s doing that. The last time we had a general as chief of staff, it didn’t end well. Al Haig [who served as chief of staff under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford] lasted little more than a month under Ford. The history here of generals as White House chiefs is not very encouraging.” (Read an extended Q&A with Whipple here.) Anthony Scaramucci walks down the steps of Air Force One after arriving in Long Island on Friday. (Evan Vucci/AP) MORE ON THE FALL OF THE MOOCH: -- Post columnist Dana Milbank describes Scaramucci’s termination as a “fall of biblical proportions.” He said the day he was hired that Priebus was like a brother to him. Then he clarified that they might be more like the brothers Cain and Abel. “Scaramucci’s retelling of Genesis had a twist: It was a murder-suicide,” Dana writes. “Priebus’s Abel was indeed slain by Scaramucci’s Cain … But Cain met the same fate Monday afternoon. … He wasn’t officially supposed to start until Aug. 15, so his tenure, technically, was minus 16 days. … The Mooch’s tenure was such a whirlwind that it’s tempting to describe them as Ten Days That Changed the World. But the Mooch didn’t really change anything. He just made everything wildly entertaining.” -- “With the benefit of a few more days, it’s now clear that the better analogy comes not from the Bible but from Sophocles’ Antigone, and the cases of Eteocles and Polyneices — mutual fratricides, killed on the battlefield of a civil war,” the Atlantic’s David A. Graham writes. -- Fun fact: Scaramucci is actually not the shortest serving White House communications director ever. In 1987, Ronald Reagan’s communications director John O. Koehler offered his resignation six days after beginning in the role due to revelations that he had been a member of a Nazi youth group as a child. (Alex Horton on Retropolis) -- Insult to injury: Scaramucci is listed as deceased in a new Harvard Law School alumni directory, which arrived in mailboxes last week. “An asterisk by the 1989 graduate’s name indicates that he was reported dead since the last directory, which was published in 2011,” the Reliable Source's Emily Heil reports. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- President Trump personally dictated his son's misleading statement about his meeting with a Russian lawyer during the campaign. Ashley Parker, Carol D. Leonnig, Philip Rucker and Tom Hamburger scoop: “On the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Germany last month, President Trump’s advisers discussed how to respond to a new revelation that Trump’s oldest son had met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign — a disclosure the advisers knew carried political and potentially legal peril. The strategy, the advisers agreed, should be for Donald Trump Jr. to release a statement to get ahead of the story. They wanted to be truthful, so their account couldn’t be repudiated later if the full details emerged. But within hours, at the president’s direction, the plan changed. Flying home from Germany on July 8 aboard Air Force One, Trump personally dictated a statement in which Trump Jr. said that he and the Russian lawyer had ‘primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children’ when they met in June 2016, according to multiple people with knowledge of the deliberations. ... “Air Force One took off from Germany shortly after 6 p.m. — about noon in Washington. In a forward cabin, Trump was busy working on his son’s statement, according to people with knowledge of events. The president dictated the statement to (Hope) Hicks, who served as a go-between with Trump Jr., who was not on the plane, sharing edits between the two men, according to people with knowledge of the discussions … “As special counsel Robert S. Mueller III looks into potential obstruction of justice as part of his broader investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, these advisers worry that the president’s direct involvement leaves him needlessly vulnerable to allegations of a coverup. 'This was … unnecessary,' said one of the president’s advisers. 'Now someone can claim he’s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn’t want you to say the whole truth.' “Trump, they say, is increasingly acting as his own lawyer, strategist and publicist, often disregarding the recommendations of the professionals he has hired. ‘He refuses to sit still,’ the presidential adviser said. ‘He doesn’t think he’s in any legal jeopardy, so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself.’” “Peter Zeidenberg, the deputy special prosecutor who investigated the George W. Bush administration’s leak of [Valerie Plame’s] identity, said Mueller will have to dig into the crafting of Trump Jr.’s statement aboard Air Force One. Prosecutors typically assume that any misleading statement is an effort to throw investigators off the track, Zeidenberg said. ‘The thing that really strikes me about this is the stupidity of involving the president,’ Zeidenberg said. ‘They are still treating this like a family-run business and they have a PR problem. … What they don’t seem to understand is this is a criminal investigation involving all of them.'

"‘We’re getting nothing done.’ John McCain’s no-holds-barred lecture to the Senate, annotated","Not even a week after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) announced he was diagnosed with a particularly brutal form of brain cancer, he stood on the Senate floor in Washington, all 99 senators and the vice president at his attention, and delivered an indictment of the modern era's hyper-politicized environment, Republicans' secretive health-care process and a wishful look back at the way things used to be. It was an emotional, no-holds barred moment that came right after the Senate voted 50-50 to debate a health-care vote, requiring Vice President Pence to break the tie. We've posted his remarks, as prepared, below and annotated it using Genius. Click on the highlighted text to read the annotations. Mr. President: I’ve stood in this place many times and addressed as president many presiding officers. I have been so addressed when I have sat in that chair, as close as I will ever be to a presidency. It is an honorific we’re almost indifferent to, isn’t it. In truth, presiding over the Senate can be a nuisance, a bit of a ceremonial bore, and it is usually relegated to the more junior members of the majority. But as I stand here today — looking a little worse for wear I’m sure — I have a refreshed appreciation for the protocols and customs of this body, and for the other ninety-nine privileged souls who have been elected to this Senate. I have been a member of the United States Senate for thirty years. I had another long, if not as long, career before I arrived here, another profession that was profoundly rewarding, and in which I had experiences and friendships that I revere. But make no mistake, my service here is the most important job I have had in my life. And I am so grateful to the people of Arizona for the privilege — for the honor — of serving here and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the history of the country I love. I’ve known and admired men and women in the Senate who played much more than a small role in our history, true statesmen, giants of American politics. They came from both parties, and from various backgrounds. Their ambitions were frequently in conflict. They held different views on the issues of the day. And they often had very serious disagreements about how best to serve the national interest. But they knew that however sharp and heartfelt their disputes, however keen their ambitions, they had an obligation to work collaboratively to ensure the Senate discharged its constitutional responsibilities effectively. Our responsibilities are important, vitally important, to the continued success of our Republic. And our arcane rules and customs are deliberately intended to require broad cooperation to function well at all. The most revered members of this institution accepted the necessity of compromise in order to make incremental progress on solving America’s problems and to defend her from her adversaries. That principled mindset, and the service of our predecessors who possessed it, come to mind when I hear the Senate referred to as the world’s greatest deliberative body. I’m not sure we can claim that distinction with a straight face today. I’m sure it wasn’t always deserved in previous eras either. But I’m sure there have been times when it was, and I was privileged to witness some of those occasions. Our deliberations today — not just our debates, but the exercise of all our responsibilities — authorizing government policies, appropriating the funds to implement them, exercising our advice and consent role — are often lively and interesting. They can be sincere and principled. But they are more partisan, more tribal more of the time than any other time I remember. Our deliberations can still be important and useful, but I think we’d all agree they haven’t been overburdened by greatness lately. And right now they aren’t producing much for the American people. Both sides have let this happen. Let’s leave the history of who shot first to the historians. I suspect they’ll find we all conspired in our decline — either by deliberate actions or neglect. We’ve all played some role in it. Certainly I have. Sometimes, I’ve let my passion rule my reason. Sometimes, I made it harder to find common ground because of something harsh I said to a colleague. Sometimes, I wanted to win more for the sake of winning than to achieve a contested policy. Incremental progress, compromises that each side criticize but also accept, just plain muddling through to chip away at problems and keep our enemies from doing their worst isn’t glamorous or exciting. It doesn’t feel like a political triumph. But it’s usually the most we can expect from our system of government, operating in a country as diverse and quarrelsome and free as ours. Considering the injustice and cruelties inflicted by autocratic governments, and how corruptible human nature can be, the problem solving our system does make possible, the fitful progress it produces, and the liberty and justice it preserves, is a magnificent achievement. Our system doesn’t depend on our nobility. It accounts for our imperfections, and gives an order to our individual strivings that has helped make ours the most powerful and prosperous society on earth. It is our responsibility to preserve that, even when it requires us to do something less satisfying than ‘winning.’ Even when we must give a little to get a little. Even when our efforts manage just three yards and a cloud of dust, while critics on both sides denounce us for timidity, for our failure to ‘triumph.’ I hope we can again rely on humility, on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other to learn how to trust each other again and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the Internet. To hell with them. They don’t want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood. Let’s trust each other. Let’s return to regular order. We’ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That’s an approach that’s been employed by both sides, mandating legislation from the top down, without any support from the other side, with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires. We’re getting nothing done. All we’ve really done this year is confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Our healthcare insurance system is a mess. We all know it, those who support Obamacare and those who oppose it. Something has to be done. We Republicans have looked for a way to end it and replace it with something else without paying a terrible political price. We haven’t found it yet, and I’m not sure we will. All we’ve managed to do is make more popular a policy that wasn’t very popular when we started trying to get rid of it. I voted for the motion to proceed to allow debate to continue and amendments to be offered. I will not vote for the bill as it is today. It’s a shell of a bill right now. We all know that. I have changes urged by my state’s governor that will have to be included to earn my support for final passage of any bill. I know many of you will have to see the bill changed substantially for you to support it. We’ve tried to do this by coming up with a proposal behind closed doors in consultation with the administration, then springing it on skeptical members, trying to convince them it’s better than nothing, asking us to swallow our doubts and force it past a unified opposition. I don’t think that is going to work in the end. And it probably shouldn’t. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats shouldn’t have forced through Congress without any opposition support a social and economic change as massive as Obamacare. And we shouldn’t do the same with ours. Why don’t we try the old way of legislating in the Senate, the way our rules and customs encourage us to act. If this process ends in failure, which seem likely, then let’s return to regular order. Let the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee under Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray hold hearings, try to report a bill out of committee with contributions from both sides. Then bring it to the floor for amendment and debate, and see if we can pass something that will be imperfect, full of compromises, and not very pleasing to implacable partisans on either side, but that might provide workable solutions to problems Americans are struggling with today. What have we to lose by trying to work together to find those solutions? We’re not getting much done apart. I don’t think any of us feels very proud of our incapacity. Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what they want isn’t the most inspiring work. There’s greater satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting them prevent agreements that don’t require abandonment of core principles, agreements made in good faith that help improve lives and protect the American people. The Senate is capable of that. We know that. We’ve seen it before. I’ve seen it happen many times. And the times when I was involved even in a modest way with working out a bipartisan response to a national problem or threat are the proudest moments of my career, and by far the most satisfying. This place is important. The work we do is important. Our strange rules and seemingly eccentric practices that slow our proceedings and insist on our cooperation are important. Our founders envisioned the Senate as the more deliberative, careful body that operates at a greater distance than the other body from the public passions of the hour. We are an important check on the powers of the Executive. Our consent is necessary for the President to appoint jurists and powerful government officials and in many respects to conduct foreign policy. Whether or not we are of the same party, we are not the President’s subordinates. We are his equal! As his responsibilities are onerous, many and powerful, so are ours. And we play a vital role in shaping and directing the judiciary, the military, and the cabinet, in planning and supporting foreign and domestic policies. Our success in meeting all these awesome constitutional obligations depends on cooperation among ourselves. The success of the Senate is important to the continued success of America. This country — this big, boisterous, brawling, intemperate, restless, striving, daring, beautiful, bountiful, brave, good and magnificent country — needs us to help it thrive. That responsibility is more important than any of our personal interests or political affiliations. We are the servants of a great nation, ‘a nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.’ More people have lived free and prosperous lives here than in any other nation. We have acquired unprecedented wealth and power because of our governing principles, and because our government defended those principles. America has made a greater contribution than any other nation to an international order that has liberated more people from tyranny and poverty than ever before in history. We have been the greatest example, the greatest supporter and the greatest defender of that order. We aren’t afraid. “We don’t covet other people’s land and wealth. We don’t hide behind walls. We breach them. We are a blessing to humanity. What greater cause could we hope to serve than helping keep America the strong, aspiring, inspirational beacon of liberty and defender of the dignity of all human beings and their right to freedom and equal justice? That is the cause that binds us and is so much more powerful and worthy than the small differences that divide us. What a great honor and extraordinary opportunity it is to serve in this body. It’s a privilege to serve with all of you. I mean it. Many of you have reached out in the last few days with your concern and your prayers, and it means a lot to me. It really does. I’ve had so many people say such nice things about me recently that I think some of you must have me confused with someone else. I appreciate it though, every word, even if much of it isn’t deserved. I’ll be here for a few days, I hope managing the floor debate on the defense authorization bill, which, I’m proud to say is again a product of bipartisan cooperation and trust among the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. After that, I’m going home for a while to treat my illness. I have every intention of returning here and giving many of you cause to regret all the nice things you said about me. And, I hope, to impress on you again that it is an honor to serve the American people in your company. Thank you, fellow senators. Mr. President, I yield the floor. "
Morning Bits,"Anthony Scaramucci flubs his Sunday debut. “[E]ither [Sarah Huckabee] Sanders got out ahead of President Trump or Anthony Scaramucci, the White House’s newly minted communications director — whose hiring Friday unnerved some West Wing staff and prompted Spicer’s resignation — didn’t have the most up-to-date information.” Republicans’ health-care bungle reaches the end of the road. “The Senate will vote on a procedural motion to take up healthcare reform this week, but it’s unknown if it will be a bill to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act or repeal it in full, the third-highest-ranking Republican senator said Sunday.” Did they ever mess up this opportunity. “Obamacare was a hodgepodge of half-measures and false starts, but compared with the GOP alternatives it looks like a masterpiece of symmetry and sophistication.” A comical blunder. “Anthony Scaramucci, the recently named White House communications director, on Sunday outed President Trump as the anonymous source who had expressed doubt to him that Russia interfered in last year’s presidential election.” Ridiculous. The GOP’s stumble into protectionism should end. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.): “It used to be a shirt, just a regular button-up shirt, might be $20, $25, and still might be in places. And at Wal-Mart, it’s $7. And so that savings, though, allows working-class people to have savings to get a television set, to go on vacation, to buy gas for their truck. So trade is really a good thing.” If only President Trump understood. The White House is bollixed up says Brian Stelter to Kellyanne Conway. “‘I appreciate your point about the president’s momentum. But this is a White House in crisis whether you recognize it or not.’” Good for him. Another botched initiative. “[A]n ambitious public works plan, arguably his best chance of rising above the partisan rancor of his first six months in office, is fast becoming an afterthought — at precisely the moment Mr. Trump needs a big, unifying issue to rewrite the narrative of his chaotic administration.” We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

"Cruz outflanked on the right, pummeled on policy","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has a fundamental problem: His political ambition far outstrips his likability and political skill. In the 2016 primary, his rudeness to Senate colleagues, glaring opportunism and awkward interpersonal skills — as much as then-candidate Donald Trump — prevented him from capturing the nomination. His off-again, on-again endorsement of Trump in the summer of 2016 merely confirmed that he lacked the skill to conceal his own hypocrisy. Realizing he’d made no friends and claimed no legislative achievements in his first four years in the Senate, Cruz decided this year he’d shed his image as an obstructionist grandstander and adopt the pose of a diligent dealmaker on health care, the issue he used to stage a government shutdown in 2013. However, Cruz, perpetually convinced that he is the smartest man in any room, failed to master the fundamentals of health-care policy, or to anticipate that fellow conservatives might actually stand on principle. As a result, his half-baked plan to permit insurers to offer unregulated plans as long as they offered one that conformed to the Affordable Care Act requirements belly-flopped. It did not take long before major insurers lowered the boom on Cruz, blasting his plan in an unusual, joint letter: It is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market. . . . This would allow the new plans to “cherry pick” only healthy people from the existing market making coverage unaffordable for the millions of people who need or want comprehensive coverage, including, for example, coverage for prescription drugs and mental health services. They explained: “As healthy people move to the less-regulated plans, those with significant medical needs will have no choice but to stay in the comprehensive plans, and premiums will skyrocket for people with preexisting conditions. This would especially impact middle-income families that that are not eligible for a tax credit.” Surely Cruz could have consulted with insurers and independent health-care experts to determine whether his plan was viable. Perhaps he wasn’t interested in finding out the answer, or perhaps he proceeded in the face of obvious flaws. In any event, he cemented his image as a man with a personal agenda, but no real policy expertise. Even more disastrously for Cruz, he found himself outflanked on the right, when Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) balked at the plan. CNBC reported: Paul actually said Wednesday that the Cruz amendment could make his problems with the Senate bill worse. The policy could drive up costs for people in the Obamacare markets . . . which the federal government would then have to step in and subsidize to prevent a death spiral. “The impressions and the rumors that we’re hearing is that’s gonna mean a lot more money in insurance bailout fund and ultimately also mean some sort of price controls,” Paul said on the conference call, adding that was “foreign to any notion of capitalism.” Lee was blindsided by Cruz’s last-minute changes. (“Significant daylight has emerged between the Senate’s dynamic conservative duo. Once shoulder to shoulder on healthcare reform with his longtime friend, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has decided to go his own way.”) At the very least, he wants more time to consider the Cruz amendment. In sum, Cruz is left championing a bill that is substantively unworkable and shunned by more principled right-wing Republicans. Cruz’s too-cute-by-half machinations leave him politically isolated, once again. At some point, one has to ask whether elected office is really Cruz’s forte. He seems to lack the interpersonal skills and legislative judgment necessary either to impress ideological purists or to forge the common ground required for legislative accomplishments. Perhaps rather than run for reelection in 2018, he might snag a federal court nomination. The prospect of bidding him farewell might induce a large majority of senators to confirm him.

The new GOP health-care bill isn’t better or worse. It’s just more incoherent.,"The Post reports: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) released a new proposal to overhaul the Affordable Care Act on Thursday after spending three weeks reworking it to win over wavering lawmakers on the right and in the center. But within hours, it was clear that Senate leaders still didn’t have the votes to fulfill their long-standing quest to replace former president Barack Obama’s 2010 health-care law. The new draft would lift many of the ACA’s regulatory requirements, allowing insurers to offer bare-bones policies without coverage for services such as preventive or mental-health care. It would also direct billions of dollars to help lower- and middle-income Americans buy plans on the private market. However, the draft leaves in place deep proposed cuts to Medicaid — and at least three Republicans quickly signaled opposition to the bill, casting doubt on McConnell’s plans to pass the bill next week. Several important aspects of the last, final gasp of  “repeal and replace” fever on the right deserve attention — most particularly the intellectual collapse and political impotence of the GOP’s right wing. Conservative senators who inveighed against weak-kneed “establishment” leaders now favor government subsidies for health care and the requirement that insurers offer exactly the same regulated health care that Obamacare required (in addition to other options). This is the party that condemned Obamacare as a government takeover of one-sixth of the economy. So what was the GOP’s complaint about Obamacare again? Republicans now put their stamp of approval on a bill that leaves in place a system they said was a failure, not to mention an infringement on free-market principles. Likewise, the right now refuses to eliminate all Obamacare taxes, a blow to the anti-tax activists who have dominated the party for 30-plus years and a nod to progressives who for years have disparaged “reverse Robin Hood” schemes to shift wealth from the less-well-off to the rich. Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) was terse and obviously disappointed. “All Obamacare taxes should be repealed. The Trump tax reform plan, the House health bill, and the original Senate health bill abolished the Obamacare 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax,” he said in a written statement. “Given the most recent language leaves some of the taxes in place, it is important for Senate Leadership to make it clear that those taxes will be abolished in tax reform this year.” If the most zealous tax-cutters now accept a bill that leaves hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes in place, what exactly does the GOP stand for when it comes to taxes? Since Republicans have acknowledged the unseemliness of big tax cuts for the rich, one wonders how they plan on justifying even bigger cuts as part of a tax reform plan. At its core, the GOP’s bastardized system — keeping Obamacare-style plans in place but adding cheaper plans with higher deductibles — defies logic and solves no particular problem. Voters said Obamacare deductibles were too high. This latest proposal continues those plans (minus the individual mandate, a move that will increase adverse selection) and adds in even higher-deductible plans. It does not halt the adverse selection/death-spiral problem in the exchanges; it accelerates it. (“Critics, including insurers, say that providing the option of skimpier plans would draw younger, healthier consumers into a separate risk pool. That development would drive up rates for the Americans buying more-comprehensive coverage on the individual market, which could in turn destabilize the entire market.”) This “solution” solves nothing, but rather underscores and accentuates the affordability problem, about which Republicans cried buckets of crocodile tears for more than seven years. The entire health-care escapade confirms what many figured out long ago — Republicans’ interest in and affinity for health-care policy is minimal. The Cato Institute’s Michael Cannon sneers at the pseudo-choice amendment embraced by some conservatives: This draft imposes ObamaCare’s “single risk pool” price controls on “freedom option” plans. Long story short, that means there is no “freedom option” in this bill. Insurers probably would not even offer non-compliant plans. If they did, ObamaCare’s “single risk pool” price controls would make secure, guaranteed-renewable health insurance impossible by taxing such plans to death. . . . The “single risk pool” price controls would require insurers to increase premiums for both both ObamaCare-compliant plans and non-compliant plans by the same percentage. If claims in the complaint market necessitate a 10 [percent] increase, while claims in the non-compliant market necessitate only a 6 percent increase, the insurer would have to increase premiums in the former market by too little and/or increase premiums in the latter market by too much. As a political matter, the latest version of Trumpcare cannot draw enough support from moderates, who still object to massive cuts in Medicaid and a plan that forces older, sicker Americans to pay more. The bill leaves supposedly staunch conservatives, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), in the position of advocating for a pseudo-Obamacare plan — and right-wing interest groups (e.g., ATR, Heritage Action) trying to justify concessions (or else criticizing the handiwork of its pets, such as Cruz). The effort makes House Republicans who voted for a prior, crueler and more regressive version of the bill look especially foolish and craven. The biggest loser in all this may be House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), who forced members to walk the plank for horrid legislation that would never pass the Senate. The common thread running through all of this is utter, acute intellectual incoherence. The bill leaves in place enough of the Affordable Care Act to make hypocrites of many prominent leaders and to disgrace chest-thumping conservatives. The bill suggests Republicans have no real policy objective here, other than wanting to eviscerate the handiwork of the eponymous author. They are reduced to pure posturing and blame-shifting. Instead of replacing Obamacare with something better, the GOP is now dedicated to replacing it with anything, no matter how bad, because it said it promised to get rid of President Barack Obama’s signature achievement. This vividly captures the split between, on one hand, Republicans who care about solving problems (Sens. Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski, Shelley Moore Capito, Susan Collins) and, on the other, Republicans who are slaves to sloganeering and who are convinced that rural, less-educated voters are unsophisticated rubes who can be bamboozled by talk radio, Fox News hosts and White House lies. The few on the far right, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who have actual principles– albeit ones we don’t agree with — are revealed to be far fewer in number than their rhetorical volume suggests. The good news for the country and the center right may be that the Portman/Murkowski/Collins/Capito wing of the party may be the only part of the GOP to survive with its moral and intellectual credibility intact. The bad news is that it is still badly outnumbered by the intellectually vacant, crass operators who have demonstrated no capacity for governance. Perhaps in finding common ground with Democrats to fix Obamacare, the moderate/problem-solving wing can redeem the party and reshuffle the political landscape; if not, its members at least sleep at night knowing that they were not responsible for the demise of a once-serious party.

Does Trinity Lutheran mark the “end of originalism”?,"What is it about originalism that makes smart living constitutionalist law professors write silly things? Duquesne law professor Bruce Ledewitz is a smart guy. But he’s written a snarky op-ed about about the Trinity Lutheran case and originalism entitled, ‘Trinity’ case marks end of originalism.  Let’s review it, shall we? It was probably always a mistake to take originalism seriously as a theory of constitutional interpretation. Originalism, or textualism as its great proponent, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, termed it, is the theory that constitutional provisions should be interpreted in accordance with their original public meaning. The theory never made any sense either as a matter of language or political theory and was premised on a nihilistic skepticism about the possibility of truth in political affairs. To claim that originalism as a theory of constitutional interpretation is wrong is commonplace among law professors. But Professor Ledewitz is not content to make such a claim. No, he needs to claim that it “was probably always a mistake to take originalism seriously.” And one need not take it seriously because the “theory never made any sense either as a matter of language or political theory and was premised on a nihilistic skepticism about the possibility of truth in political affairs.” Of course, he fails to explain, much less substantiate, any of this. True, this is only a newspaper op-ed. But format is no excuse for a legal academic to affirmatively make a wild claim about a major position in constitutional law held by many thoughtful and respected academics–who have defended their views at length from critics like Professor Ledewitz. Professor Ledewitz is trading here on his title as a law professor as well as on the unfamiliarity of his newspaper audience with a literature he purports to be familiar with as a scholar. Nevertheless, originalism has achieved a real rhetorical dominance. But, with the Trinity Lutheran Church decision on June 26, originalism as a theory can confidently be relegated to the historical ash heap. This is pure anti-intellectualism. According to this law professor, there is no need for him or anyone else even to address originalists anymore–much less have one on your faculty–because their views can merely be summarily and “confidently” dismissed without further argument. He then continues: In Trinity Lutheran, Missouri excluded a church playground from a state reimbursement grant program toward the purchase of safe playground surfacing material. Missouri has a state constitutional provision forbidding the disbursement of public money to any church. Except for church ownership, the playground would have qualified for participation in the program. The church sued over the exclusion on the ground that its right to free exercise of religion had been infringed. The church won, 7-2. Given the safety issue and the nonreligious nature of the playground, the decision was certainly a sensible outcome. But, from the point of view of originalism, the decision was ridiculous. If there was a single principle that united most of the framers and supporters of the original Establishment Clause, it was the prohibition against the payment of public money to churches. Because he does not specify what he means by “makes no sense as a matter of language,” I cannot be certain what he is claiming. But if he means to claim that an original public meaning of the text cannot be discovered “as a matter of language,” he then immediately contradicts that claim by asserting an original meaning of the Establishment Clause so definitive that a finding for Trinity Lutheran was “ridiculous” “from the point of view of originalism.” I am not an expert on the Religion Clauses, so I am not as confident about their original meaning as Professor Ledewitz. But every originalist–indeed every living constitutionist–understands that neither the Free Exercise Clause nor the Establishment Clause originally applied to the states at all. Instead, it applied to Congress. What exactly an “establishment of religion” was in 1791 is a matter of good faith academic dispute. But some thoughtful originalists have maintained that, whatever constituted an “establishment of religion,” the First Amendment’s wording “make no law with respect to” forbade Congress both from establishing a national religion (at minimum) and also from disestablishing a state religion. On this account, the Establishment Clause operated–perhaps exclusively–as a federalism provision, expressly acknowledging that Congress had “no power” in this area, with all powers pertaining to religion reserved to the states. So if we are speaking of a state law, then we must be talking about the meaning of the 14th Amendment–a constitutional provision that makes no appearance in Professor Ledewitz’s op-ed. And if we are talking about original meaning, then it is the original meaning of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment that is at issue. Professor Ledewitz offers us nothing on this either. Many originalists believe that the “incorporation doctrine” by which what came in the 20th Century to be known as “the Bill of Rights” was somehow incorporated into the 14th Amendment is an anachronism. These originalists maintain that the Privileges or Immunities Clause was a free standing provision, the substance of which included both the “Corfield v. Coryell” rights associate with the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV together with additional fundamental “privileges” of citizens to which the first ten amendments referred. Others would limit the Privileges or Immunities Clause to the latter category. But for both of these originalist camps, conceiving of the 14th Amendment as literally “incorporating” “the Bill of Rights”–as advocated by Justice Black in the 1940s is modern invention. In addition, some originalists maintain that, because the original meaning of the Establishment Clause was a federalism provision barring Congress from disestablishing state religions, it did not enunciate an individual right that could be considered a Privileges or Immunity of citizens of U.S. citizens. Others, like Kurt Lash, disagree on the ground that, by 1868, the meaning of the Establishment Clause had evolved so its public meaning at the time of the 14th Amendment did include an individual privilege or immunity. But if Lash and others are wrong about this, then the original meaning of the 14th Amendment protected only free exercise rights from state infringement; it did not bar states from making laws that could constitute an establishment of religion.  (This would be what Sandy Levinson calls an “unhappy ending” for an originalist who believes today in a strong separation of church and state.) So when Professor Ledewitz in the next sentence says that “even if a decision by Missouri to pay the church might somehow be thought not to violate the Establishment Clause,” he is asserting what he claims to be an originalist position so obvious that to deny it is to be ridiculous. But, to the contrary, the Establishment Clause did not originally apply to a state like Missouri, and it is not clear either that any and all payments to a church would have constituted “an establishment of religion,” or that an antiestablishment principle even applied to the states via the original meaning of the 14th Amendment!  But let us proceed. And, even if a decision by Missouri to pay the church might somehow be thought not to violate the Establishment Clause [check!], it could not possibly be argued that the original Free Exercise Clause required a payment from Missouri. You could have asked any member of the founding generation whether the Free Exercise Clause ever required the payment of public money to a church and the answer would have been a unanimous no. Neither the Court, nor Trinity Lutheran, maintained that “the Free Exercise Clause . . . required the payment of public money to a church.” Instead, for the challengers, the issue was whether the 14th Amendment prohibited a state from discriminating against some of its citizens who were applying for a government benefit on the ground that they were organized as a church to exercise their religion. A majority of the Court agreed this was unconstitutional. Indeed, the state constitutional provision in the case–a so-called Blaine Amendment–was rooted in anti-Catholic bigotry. When protestants controlled the public schools, they did not want to see Catholics setting up their own school system. So Catholics would be made to pay twice: once for the protestant “public” school they would not utilize and again for a Catholic school they would.  (Oh and if you want an example of just how protestants controlled the government schools, consider that as a second grader in Calumet City, Illinois, I–a Jew–played a shepherd kneeling at the manger of baby Jesus at our public school’s annual Christmas pageant. Later, in the seventh grade, I portrayed “Scrooge” in my junior high school’s annual Christmas play. All quite voluntarily.) Whether and how the 14th Amendment might bar state discrimination in the dispensation of benefits on the basis of the religion of its citizens is a matter of both original meaning, as well as the need to develop implementing rules to apply that meaning to particular cases. And those implementing rules might well take into account the discriminatory origins of an otherwise facially-neutral provision like a Blaine Amendment, as the Court did for Chinese Americans in Yick Wo v. Hopkins. All this is complicated, for originalist and nonoriginalist constitutional scholars alike. But it’s all very easy for Professor Ledewitz. According to him, “how the living constitution works” is that “[w]e apply constitutional principles in ways that make sense today.” Easy peasy. He then proceeds to impugn the good faith and academic integrity of originalists scholars: The Trinity Lutheran decision does not mean that the cottage industry of originalism will shut down. The reason for its continuation is that originalism as a political matter never had anything to do with interpretive theory. The real purpose of originalism is to overturn the expansion of federal government power associated with the New Deal. This is clear in the pronouncements of leading originalists like Randy Barnett of Georgetown Law School, the mastermind of the Obamacare judicial challenge, and a supporter of what is called the pre-New Deal court. Since powerful economic interests in this country could never convince the American people to surrender the power of the federal government to deal with national problems, originalism must be relied on to do this in the courts, under the misleading rubric that judges enforcing history are doing so in a value neutral way. So “the purpose” of originalist scholars like me “never had anything to do with interpretive theory.” “The real purpose” is purely political. Of course, modern originalists hold a variety of political views–from libertarians (like me) to conservatives to political progressives–and not just Jack Balkin. Yet, we are all somehow engaged in deliberately misleading “the American people” on behalf of “powerful economic interests in this country.”  This is the message Professor Ledewitz chose to convey to the readers of the Philadelphia Inquirer. (For the record, while I support some pre-New Deal Supreme Court doctrines, I strongly oppose others, but this seems not to matter to Professor Ledewitz.)  He then concludes: Even the Republican majority in Congress does not understand the bill of goods it is being sold under the name of originalism. Included in the healthcare reform proposals being debated in the Senate are proposed national caps on pain and suffering in medical malpractice cases. Whatever one thinks of these proposals, they concern a problem national in scope that Congress should have the power to deal with. Certainly the framers of the Constitution, who were practical men intending to create a federal government with the necessary powers to deal with national issues, would agree with that if they were alive today. Such are the clairvoyant powers of living constitutionalists, at least according to Professor Ledewitz. The framers were practical men, Professor Ledewitz is a practical man, so the framers would have agreed with Professor Ledewitz. It’s simple logic. But, from the perspective of the 18th century, any such legislation would be unconstitutional as invasive of the reserved powers of the states. Professor Ledewitz–along with many Republicans in Congress–would have Congress regulate state tort law systems because of their effect on interstate commerce. The question posed by a written Constitution is not whether “this makes sense today” but whether this overruling of one government by another government is authorized in the Constitution. Speaking on behalf of living constitutionalism, Professor Ledewitz would not be bothered with such questions. As the Trinity Lutheran case shows, we need not be ruled from the grave. All of our law, but especially constitutional law, should be interpreted from our own perspective. But does it “make sense today” that liberal judges vote for what “makes sense to them today” and conservative justices vote on “what makes sense to them today”? I mean, what could possibly go wrong? "
Job growth surged in June,"The U.S. labor market rebounded in June, new government data showed Friday, as employers surpassed the expectations of most economists by adding 222,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 percent, from 4.3 percent in May, but it did so for a good reason — more people joined the labor force to look for work. The Labor Department also revised its estimates for job gains in April and May, raising the combined figure by 47,000 jobs. June's job growth was among the strongest seen since President Trump took office in January with promises to boost economic growth and bring back jobs that had moved offshore. However, economists say that Trump has probably not been in office long enough to have had much of an influence on the economy and that current job gains are the product of much longer-term trends. “We’re been creating close to 200,000 jobs a month now for more than seven years. That’s just an incredible achievement. And that machine is still humming,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said Friday.  U.S. stock markets closed slightly higher Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.44 percent, after retreating from near-record highs on Monday. In June, the largest gains were seen in the health-care sector, which added 37,000 jobs as an aging U.S. population continued to drive the industry. The ranks of day-care providers, financial analysts and miners also swelled last month. Yet the numbers were disappointing on workers' wages, which stayed flat despite the job increases. Average hourly earnings were up by 2.5 percent from a year ago to $26.25, continuing a streak of relatively weak wage growth. That may seem somewhat contradictory, since employers have been trading anecdotes of the trouble they've had finding qualified employees, said Cathy Barrera, chief economic adviser for ZipRecruiter, a jobs site. “There’s a lot of anecdotes about job shortages in certain geographic areas or for certain types of skills,” Barrera said. “That’s another mystery as to why exactly the wage growth isn’t accelerating if we’re seeing these sorts of gaps or shortages.”  Barrera said the reason may have to do with America’s large pool of younger workers — who have struggled to gain much job experience through the recession. Employers may be recruiting less experienced workers and training them in-house, rather than offering pay increases. For other economists, though, the tepid wage growth is a sign that the economy still has room to run before most people who want a job are able to get one. “If employers indeed really needed those workers and they couldn’t find them, then they would take all the steps they could take to get them,” said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. “And the first, very clearly, is to increase wages.” As the economy continues to heat up, job hunters facing obstacles because of lower education levels, prison records or racial discrimination should now have an easier time finding employment. Gould points to an encouraging sign in the drop in the African American unemployment rate, to 7.1 percent in June from 8.8 percent a year ago. Though the rate is still much higher than for whites, it has fallen three times as quickly as the overall unemployment rate has during the last year. Eight years into the current economic expansion, the pace of hiring remains strong. But it's still much slower than what would be required to meet Trump’s ambitious promise to create 25 million jobs in the next decade. The president took to Twitter earlier in the week to tout economic gains. “Really great numbers on jobs & the economy!” he tweeted. “Things are starting to kick in now, and we have just begun!” Trump’s election fueled hopes of tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other policies that would support business. But while the administration has moved quickly to on deregulation, efforts to cut taxes and shift spending have proved far more difficult, with congressional Republicans bogged down over health-care reform. In a statement Friday morning, Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) celebrated the jobs numbers and the growth in the labor force, but said House Republicans had a lot more work to do on tax reform. Working with President Trump and the Senate"
Why drafting in a vacuum is so dangerous,"Republicans have refused to hold substantive hearings on their health-care bill and to solicit input from relevant groups. In other words, their ideas haven’t been publicly vetted. That leads to some pretty silly proposals. Lacking an individual mandate, the Senate Republicans today added a proposal to impose a six-month waiting period for anyone who allows their health-care coverage to lapse for 63 days or more in the prior year and later decides they need insurance/care. This may not make it through the reconciliation rules, allowing the bill to pass with just 50 votes with a tie-breaking vote by the vice president. The Hill reported, “The addition of the six-month waiting period could make it more difficult to pass the legislation if the Senate parliamentarian rules the provision violates the complex budget reconciliation rules. Republican leadership was working over the weekend to make sure the provision complies with the rules and can be included.” Even if it does make it through the parliamentarian’s scrutiny, the idea is a non-solution. The individual mandate was intended to coerce young, healthy people into buying insurance, thereby helping to pay for older, sicker people in the exchanges. Younger people might avoid buying insurance because they foolishly think they won’t get sick. But if they think they won’t get sick, why would they be persuaded by a penalty that goes into effect when they, um, get sick? Actually, one significant problem with the exchanges is that the mandate was not tough enough. People could move in and out of a plan too easily, thereby avoiding paying into the system and helping to subsidize those older, sicker people. In June 2014 the Congressional Budget Office found that 87 percent of those without insurance could avoid the penalty. “The decrease in the number of people who are projected to pay the penalty largely stems from an increase in CBO and [Joint Tax Committee’s] projection of the number of people who will be exempt from the penalty. That increase is attributable in part to regulations issued since September 2012 by the Departments of Health and Human Services and the Treasury and in part to technical updates and changes in the economic outlook.” In other words, it was too easy to slip in and out of the system. The regulations or “hardship exemptions” seemed reasonable on the surface: The hardship exemption rules, for example, let anyone who “experienced domestic violence” avoid the mandate, without providing any documentation of abuse. Getting a shut-off notice from a utility is also sufficient to claim a hardship exemption. In addition, the law forbids the IRS from using its normal enforcement tools to collect unpaid penalties. Tax experts say the best it can do is withhold the penalty amount from any tax refund due. The incredibly broad exemption from the insurance mandate also threatens to undermine ObamaCare’s market regulations. The law included the mandate as a way to force most people into buying coverage, which would in turn keep premiums down for everyone else. If you can get out of paying or understand you cannot really be forced to pay up, there is much more incentive to game the system. So if you really wanted to prevent the “death spirals” and keep young people in the exchanges to spread the cost from older, sicker people, you would tighten the mandate, not do away with it and come up with a flimsy substitute.

"Trump ‘simply does not care’ about HIV/AIDS, say 6 experts who just quit his advisory council","The first hints of an uncertain future for the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS came last year, when Donald Trump's presidential campaign refused to meet with advocates for people living with HIV, said Scott Schoettes, a member of the council since 2014. That unease was magnified on Inauguration Day in January, when an official White House website for the Office of National AIDS Policy vanished, Schoettes said. “I started to think, was it going to be useful or wise or would it be possible to work with this administration?” Schoettes told The Washington Post. “Still, I made a decision to stick it out and see what we could do.” Less than six months later, Schoettes said those initial reservations had given way to full-blown frustration over a lack of dialogue with or caring from Trump administration officials about issues relating to HIV or AIDS. Last week, he and five others announced they were quitting the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS, also known as PACHA. According to Schoettes, the last straw — or “more like a two-by-four than a straw” — had come in May, after the Republican-dominated House passed the American Health Care Act, which he said would have “devastating” effects on those living with HIV. “The Trump Administration has no strategy to address the on-going HIV/AIDS epidemic, seeks zero input from experts to formulate HIV policy, and — most concerning — pushes legislation that will harm people living with HIV and halt or reverse important gains made in the fight against this disease,” Schoettes wrote in a blistering guest column for Newsweek announcing the resignations. The column also pointed out that Trump has still not appointed anyone to head the White House Office of National AIDS Policy, something President Barack Obama had done 36 days after his inauguration. [The graying of HIV: 1 in 6 new U.S. cases are people older than 50] “Within 18 months, that new director and his staff crafted the first comprehensive U.S. HIV/AIDS strategy. By contrast, President Trump appears to have no plan at all,” Schoettes wrote. “Public health is not a partisan issue. . . . If the President is not going to engage on the subject of HIV/AIDS, he should at least continue policies that support people living with and at higher risk for HIV and have begun to curtail the epidemic.” The column was co-signed by the five other members of the council who had resigned, including Lucy Bradley-Springer, Gina Brown, Ulysses W. Burley III, Grissel Granados and Michelle Ogle. As of Monday morning, some of their bios remained on PACHA's government website. At Monday's White House press briefing, press secretary Sean Spicer said he did not know if the council members who had resigned would be replaced but defended Trump against accusations that he didn't care about HIV or AIDS.

Pence’s lawyer is the godfather of Comey’s daughter. That’s ‘the swamp’ for you.,"Vice President Pence became the latest member of the Trump administration to lawyer up Thursday, announcing that he had hired an outside attorney, Richard Cullen, to deal with the ongoing probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. elections. News reports described the sterling reputation of Cullen, 69, a former Virginia attorney general and longtime Washington insider who played crucial roles in some of the most high-profile political investigations of the last several decades. But other parts of his resume attracted even more interest. For three years, Cullen worked at a Richmond law firm with a central figure of the Russia investigation: FBI Director James B. Comey, who was just fired by Pence’s boss, President Trump. And not only is Cullen his “close associate,” as news reports described, but he is also the godfather of one of Comey’s daughters. “So swampy,” one Twitter user said. “What a tangled web we weave …” tweeted another. [Pence hires outside counsel to deal with Russia probe inquiries] Outside of President Trump’s chosen personal attorney, a New York-based corporate lawyer, the legal minds affiliated with the Russia probe are indeed all part of the same web — or dwellers in the same swamp, if that’s how you see Washington. Though Trump spent his campaign pledging to “drain the swamp,” the phrase is not his invention. Elected officials on both sides have deployed it for decades. Think of the swamp as the ecosystem it is, inhabited by particular species that thrive on its food-chain, few so cooperatively as politicians and their lawyers. In such a place, it would be tough to assemble a team of people that hadn’t shared a cubicle at least once or twice, or passed one another going through revolving doors and revolving scandals. A relatively small group of people specialize in this type of work and their names come up, depending on their age, across some the biggest Washington controversies from Watergate on. Even in the earliest stages of the Russia investigation, as more and more members of the Trump administration lawyer up and the office of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, assembles its own team, the pattern is once again repeating itself. The origin of many of these connections is the investigation of the Watergate break in, 45 years ago this coming weekend. Cullen, fresh out of college in the 1970s, was involved with Watergate from the sidelines. He served on the campaign staff for Republican Rep. M. Caldwell Butler of Virginia, a member of the House Judiciary Committee. “And lo and behold, there’s the impeachment,” Cullen recalled in a 2007 profile in Richmond Law Magazine. As a swing vote, Butler played a crucial role in Nixon’s impeachment hearings, and Cullen often fielded questions from reporters covering it. Years later, he served as special counsel to then Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr. (R-Va.) in the Iran-contra investigations. As the Richmond Law magazine profile stated it, “Cullen has frequently crossed paths with the powerful, the famous and the infamous.” Comey and Cullen worked together at law firm McGuireWoods between 1993 and 1996. And although they did not overlap, both served in the U.S. attorney’s Office in Richmond. Cullen, who is now chairman of McGuireWoods, has often spoken highly of Comey in the press. When Comey was named FBI Director in 2013, Cullen told the Richmond Times Dispatch that his former colleague would “be a great director. There are many people in Richmond who remember him and his family fondly and are very pleased that the president has chosen him for such a vitally important position.” But two years later, Cullen and Comey’s ties became news. Cullen was hired to represent FIFA chief Sepp Blatter in the corruption investigation into soccer’s governing body, a probe led by the agency of his “close associate” — then FBI director Comey. Comey also has a long personal history with Mueller. Soon after Mueller was appointed special counsel, questions were raised about his close relationship with Comey during their time together working for the Department of Justice, Mueller as FBI director and Comey as deputy attorney general, where together they intervened to block President George W. Bush’s domestic surveillance program. Some Republicans have insisted that their friendship constitutes a conflict of interest, as Comey’s status as a likely star witness in Mueller’s probe becomes more clear. Some Trump supporters are using that, and the fact that some of Mueller’s hires have been Democratic contributors, in an effort to justify the firing of Mueller by Trump, a possibility considered by the president, according to his friend Christopher Ruddy. [Christopher Ruddy, the Trump whisperer: ‘I’m honest with him’] On Thursday, Trump tweeted: “You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history — led by some very bad and conflicted people!” You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history – led by some very bad and conflicted people! #MAGA — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017  Beyond his friendship with Comey, Mueller’s appointment drew skepticism from some when it was reported that the law firm he left for the special prosecutor role, WilmerHale, was representing other key players in the investigation: former Trump aide Paul Manafort and the president’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. The Department of Justice ultimately ruled that Mueller’s past connection to WilmerHale would not impede his judgment since he was not connected to the other three clients. Mueller resigned and took with him at least three others from the firm to join his “dream team” of lawyers for the probe. Manafort, whose dealings with a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party are at the center of the probe, is being represented by WilmerHale partner Reginald Brown. Brown worked in the Bush White House and runs the firm’s financial institutions group and congressional investigations practice. Brown’s WilmerHale partner, Jamie Gorelick, a staunch liberal who served as deputy attorney general during the Clinton years and was a favorite for attorney general had Hillary Clinton won the presidency, is being lambasted by a few as a turncoat for taking on as clients Ivanka Trump and Kushner. [When a liberal power lawyer represents the Trump family, things can get ugly] She told Politico she was still recovering from the loss of the Clinton campaign, which she worked on, when she was approached about working for the Trumps. Like Cullen, she has ties to Watergate. Her first case as a lawyer was helping represent former president Nixon before the Supreme Court protecting his papers. As a member of the commission tasked with investigating the 9/11 attacks, Gorelick frequently met with then-FBI Director Mueller, according to a 2004 article in the Chicago Tribune, which reported the FBI was “intensely lobbying commission members in an effort to convince them it’s up to the task of protecting the nation.” “I’ve had lunch with him, I’m sure everybody has had lunch with him,” Gorelick said of Mueller at the time, the Chicago Tribune reported. The only lawyer who seems to have few, if any, ties to the Washington establishment is Marc Kasowitz, who has long defended the business mogul but brings to the table little experience in matters of criminal justice. It’s a disconnect that bids an oh-so-DC question — does an outsider thrive in the swamp or drown in it?

The Daily 202: Leftward lurch in Democratic gubernatorial primary reflects the transformation of Virginia,"With Breanne Deppisch and Joanie Greve THE BIG IDEA: Today’s Democratic primary for Virginia governor between Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam and former congressman Tom Perriello can be viewed through many lenses: establishment vs. insurgent, outsider vs. insider, radical vs. incremental, patrician vs. progressive, neo-populist vs. practiced pragmatist. Some pundits frame the race as some sort of proxy rematch of Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders. Others say it’s more like Clinton versus Barack Obama circa 2008. With polls showing Northam and Perriello running neck-and-neck, what’s been most striking in the homestretch is how far left both have come. While some of the posturing is certainly about trying to ride the wave of resistance to Donald Trump and appeal to base voters in a low-turnout primary, the journeys both have taken over the past decade tell a larger story about how much the state of Virginia has transformed, from red to purple to maybe even slightly blue. Northam acknowledges that he voted for George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. Republicans aggressively wooed him as a freshman state senator in 2009 to defect from the Democratic Party. He ran for LG four years ago as a fiscal conservative and moderate. Perriello was a one-term wonder in the U.S. House. In 2008, he toppled a longtime incumbent in a ruby-red congressional district around Charlottesville that included the University of Virginia. When students came out in droves to vote for the hope and change offered by Obama, Perriello rode his coattails. Two years later, he got swept out by the tea party wave. If you watch TV in the D.C. media market, you’ve heard he lost his seat because he voted for Obamacare.  That’s true. But he voted for an amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have prevented any federal subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion. Perriello won the National Rifle Association’s endorsement when he ran for Congress after praising the group as “the epitome of people-powered politics.” Now he blasts the NRA as “a nut-job extremist organization.” Perriello also signed on with a group of Republican lawmakers to support oil and gas drilling off Virginia’s coast as a congressman. Now he’s “very skeptical” about offshore drilling. -- Virginia was the only Southern state Clinton won last November. In 2008, Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to carry the commonwealth since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The state was hard fought until the end in 2012, and Mitt Romney finished with 47 percent – apropos for that cycle. But Trump garnered just 44 percent in 2016 – the lowest vote share for any GOP nominee since Tom Dewey in 1948. -- The center of political gravity continues shifting more towards Northern Virginia as the D.C. suburbs grow. This region has become more Democratic with an influx of immigrants, federal employees and highly-educated technology workers. Democrats used to do very well in coal country, meanwhile, but the southwestern region of the state has drifted out of reach and Trump ran up huge margins there. Check out this visualization of how rural parts of the state have become redder over the past few decades, even as the state became bluer because of dense pockets of Democratic support: -- What a difference a decade makes: To atone for his apostasies, one of Perriello’s very first campaign stops after launching his campaign was at a Falls Church abortion clinic. Though NARAL backed his opponent, he has a 100 percent score based on his answers to the group’s questionnaire. Perriello also now promises free community college, paid family leave and universal pre-kindergarten. Northam promises a ban on assault weapons, a free associate’s degree in exchange for a year of public service and to make preschool more affordable for low-income families. On almost every policy issue, the candidates are simpatico. Both support a $15-an-hour minimum wage and came out for marijuana  decriminalization. They’ve often wound up trying to out-do one another on who can be the most rhetorically anti-Trump. Northam, for instance, calls Trump a “narcissistic maniac” in his stump speech and his TV ads. Each has also emphasized stylistic and biographic differences. Northam, 57, was a pediatric neurologist who spent eight years in the Army – treating casualties in Desert Storm. Perriello, 42, earned his undergrad and law degrees from Yale and helped prosecute war crimes in Sierra Leone before going to Congress. After he lost, he led the advocacy arm of the liberal Center for American Progress. Then Obama appointed him as a State Department envoy. -- Perriello, perceived by insiders as the underdog, won the backing of the professional left: Sanders and Elizabeth Warren endorsed him, George Soros gave half a million bucks and out-of-state environmentalists got on board when he opposed two gas pipelines. -- Northam, who speaks with a rural Southern drawl, scored every establishment endorsement that would traditionally matter in a statewide primary: the governor, both senators, every Democrat in the state legislature and three of the four Democratic congressmen in the delegation. (The fourth is neutral.) He’s also got the pro-choice groups and the teachers unions. -- Politicians are going to pander. That’s what politicians do. But even if Perriello and Northam are putting their fingers in the wind, all these explicit expressions of liberalism show which way they think the wind is blowing in Virginia. Until very recently, serious Democrats who wanted to win statewide – even ones looking to get a leg up in competitive primaries – were hyper-cautious when answering questions about hot-buttons like guns, abortion, gay rights and drugs. They certainly didn’t bring those issues up – unless it was to break with the Democratic Party as a way of signaling cultural conservatism. In 2013, Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) foreshadowed the dynamic in this year’s primary by talking up his support for reproductive rights  and gun control. He didn’t even have a challenger from his left, but he was trying to gin up the base and mobilize unmarried women who don’t typically vote in off-year elections. It worked. This was a sea change from 2001, when Mark Warner won the governorship by focusing on red corners of the state as much as the D.C. ‘burbs. He ran as a “radical centrist,” sponsored a NASCAR team, used bluegrass music for his campaign theme song and expressed support for Bush in commercials that ran after Sept. 11. (Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will be back in the spotlight again today as he questions Attorney General Jeff Sessions.) -- The winner of today’s Democratic primary will enter the general election as the frontrunner against likely Republican nominee Ed Gillespie. The former Washington lobbyist and RNC chairman, who came within a few thousand votes of toppling Warner in 2014, is the heavy favorite against Corey Stewart, who chaired Trump’s campaign in Virginia last year, and state Sen. Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach. (Read my March Big Idea about the GOP primary here.) -- Turnout is expected to be low in both primaries, which works in Northam’s favor since he’s the favorite of party regulars. -- Canvassers for both Democrats lament that the electorate seems largely tuned out, even people who have worked themselves up into an anti-Trump lather. A Washington Post poll last month found that just two in 10 Democratic and Republican-leaning voters were paying “very close” attention to this race. (Laura Vozzella and Fenit Nirappil explored this dynamic in Sunday’s paper.) -- African Americans could make up as much as a quarter of the Democratic electorate today. Perriello has been running an ad with a clip of Obama offering support for his 2010 reelection, but despite his best efforts he couldn’t get the former president to endorse him. To ensure Obama didn’t come off the sidelines, Jonathan Martin reported in the Times last week, Northam telephoned Eric Holder to assure the former Attorney General that he’d been an early supporter and to request that he pass along the message. While about 30 former Obama aides have publicly offered support for Perriello, endorsements from staffers don’t move votes. WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING: -- The Golden State Warriors found redemption, beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 129-120 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals and winning their second championship in three years. Tim Bontemps reports: “Last July, five NBA all-stars met in a room in The Hamptons on Long Island. Four of them — Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala — sat on one side of the table, fresh off an epic collapse from a 3-1 lead against the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. On the other side sat Kevin Durant … So it was fitting Monday night, when the Warriors found themselves in the exact same position — holding a 3-1 lead over these same Cavaliers, trying to close out the NBA Finals on their home court here at Oracle Arena — that Warriors Coach Steve Kerr went repeatedly to the lineup he is often reluctant to use, no matter how unstoppable it is — the five all-stars playing together.” -- The Senate reached a bipartisan compromise to bring a Russian sanctions bill to the floor for a vote. Karoun Demirjian reports: “The measure, which will be attached to a bill to stiffen Iran sanctions that is under consideration, incorporates proposals to codify existing Russia sanctions, introduce punitive measures against Moscow in light of Russia’s aggressive activities in Ukraine, introduce measures addressing Syria and the realm of cyberhacking, and give Congress the power to review efforts by the administration to scale back sanctions against Russia before they can go through ... The measure filed Monday night directs sanctions toward Russia’s intelligence and defense apparatus, as well as parts of its energy, mining, railways and shipping economy. It also includes provisions to punish those engaged in corruption and human rights abuses.” GET SMART FAST:​​ THERE’S A BEAR IN THE WOODS: -- Hackers allied with the Russian government have developed a cyberweapon that U.S. researchers say has the potential to be the “most disruptive yet” against essential American electrical systems. Ellen Nakashima reports: “The malware, which researchers have dubbed CrashOverride, is known to have disrupted only one energy system — in Ukraine in December. In that incident, the hackers briefly shut down one-fifth of the electric power generated in Kiev. But with modifications, it could be deployed against U.S. electric transmission and distribution systems to devastating effect, said Sergio Caltagirone, director of threat intelligence for Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that studied the malware … And Russian government hackers have already shown their interest in targeting U.S. energy and other utility systems. ‘It’s the culmination of over a decade of theory and attack scenarios,’ Caltagirone warned. ‘It’s a game changer.’” -- Russian attempts to hack state voting systems ran far deeper than previously reported and could continue to affect future elections. Bloomberg’s Michael Riley and Jordan Robertson report: “In Illinois, investigators found evidence that cyber intruders tried to delete or alter voter data. The hackers accessed software designed to be used by poll workers on Election Day, and in at least one state accessed a campaign finance database … In all, the Russian hackers hit systems in a total of 39 states ... The new details … show the scope of alleged hacking that federal investigators are scrutinizing as they look into whether Trump campaign officials may have colluded in the efforts. But they also paint a worrisome picture for future elections: The newest portrayal of potentially deep vulnerabilities in the U.S.’s patchwork of voting technologies comes less than a week after former FBI Director James Comey warned Congress that Moscow isn’t done meddling.” -- British authorities may be covering up the Russian political assassination of Alexander Perepilichnyy. From a Buzzfeed News investigation with five bylines: “The British government is suppressing explosive intelligence that Alexander Perepilichnyy, a financier who exposed a vast financial crime by Russian government officials, was likely assassinated on the direct orders of Vladimir Putin. Perepilichnyy, who faced repeated threats after fleeing to Britain, was found dead outside his home in Surrey after returning from a mysterious trip to Paris in 2012. Despite an expert detecting signs of a fatal plant poison in his stomach, the British police have insisted there was no evidence of foul play. WOULD TRUMP FIRE MUELLER? -- A close friend of Trump's raised the politically explosive possibility last night that the president could move to fire Robert Mueller"
"The Health 202: Amid Comey drama, a health-care skirmish is unfolding",THE PROGNOSIS The drama over James B. Comey's testimony Thursday before the Senate Intelligence Committee isn't the only excitement playing out on Capitol Hill today. A lower-profile fight involving the House health-care bill and whether it can go over to the Senate is not exactly Comey vs. Trump on charges of Russian election interference. But it is critical to how -- and whether -- the Affordable Care Act gets a makeover anytime soon. It also shows just how ridiculously hard it is to replace big parts of the health-care law even with one-party Republican control of Washington. The skirmish pits Democrats against Republicans -- of course -- and involves private emails to Hill staffers that each side interprets as favorable to its cause. It centers on $2 billion in savings required in the House-passed health-care bill known as the American Health Care Act (which the Senate wants to use as a vehicle for its own measure) and who ultimately decides that its savings are sufficient. Under complex budget rules known as reconciliation
"At last, some honesty: The GOP is going nowhere on health care","After the broken campaign promises (We’re going to cover everybody!), the distortions (Obamacare is in a death spiral), legislative shenanigans (Vote first, score the bill later) and the out-and-out falsehoods (The GOP bill protects those with preexisting conditions), a Republican leader on Wednesday finally said something refreshingly candid about health care. Reuters reported on its interview with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): Asked about behind-the-scenes work among Senate Republicans on hammering out the provisions of a healthcare bill, McConnell said, “I don’t know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment. But that’s the goal. And exactly what the composition of that (bill) is I’m not going to speculate about because it serves no purpose,” McConnell said. Republicans hold a 52-48 Senate majority. In the event of a 50-50 tie, Republican Vice President Mike Pence would be called upon to cast a tie-breaking vote. McConnell opened the interview by saying, “There’s not a whole lot of news to be made on healthcare.” He declined to discuss what provisions he might want to see in the bill or provide a timetable for producing even a draft to show to rank-and-file Republican senators and gauge their support. Of course, he is right. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who on Wednesday put out yet another statement excoriating the House bill, are not going to agree on much of anything. (In a written statement, Collins declared, “Unfortunately, the [Congressional Budget Office] estimates that 23 million Americans would lose insurance coverage over the next decade, and the impact would disproportionately affect older, low-income Americans. In addition, for a 64-year old with an income of $26,500, the out-of-pocket premium cost could soar from $1,700 to as high as $16,100, an 850 percent increase.”) Along with Collins, there are several Republicans, including conservatives from states that expanded Medicaid, who won’t go for a rollback in Medicaid benefits. Moderates will not stand for an opt-out from a protection for those with preexisting conditions that would leave people with no access to affordable coverage. No one in the Senate has yet come up with a formula for keeping the same number of people covered while lowering out-of-pocket costs and repealing all the Obamacare taxes.  (“Now that Republicans are in a position to do so with control of both Congress and the White House, they have struggled to come up with a consensus plan. The Republican leader compared the effort to solving a Rubik’s Cube.”) Left to their own devices, could Collins, other Senate GOP moderates and Senate Democrats come up with a compromise health-care reform plan of some type? Perhaps, but then Republicans in the House would never, ever accept it and the remainder of the GOP caucus in the Senate would filibuster anything that smacked of extending instead of repealing Obamacare. By insisting on pursuing their ideological dogma — repealing Obamacare in its entirety — in a fact-free and public-opinion-free environment, Republicans irreparably damaged their ability to achieve much this year. If the House insists on the same all-or-nothing approach on taxes (a huge cut for the rich, no realistic means of plugging the flood of red ink it will create), it will be caught in another endless loop of internal fights, bad PR, false promises, rotten CBO scoring and bad polling. Unless and until they decide to pursue revenue-neutral corporate tax reform that has bipartisan support (and does not include a big break for wealthy taxpayers who set up pass-through companies), tax reform will likely join the GOP health-care bill in the legislative morgue. Whether it is the health care bill, tax reform or the budget, the Trump White House and the GOP-led Congress have done a bang-up job of convincing voters that they are fiscally irresponsible and dishonest (both in their accounting and their representations as to what is in their legislation). Moreover, they have cemented the perception that Republicans are willing to wreak havoc on the most vulnerable in order to give big tax cuts to the rich. Instead of keeping funding stable and reforming safety-net programs, the White House has pursued a slash-and-burn approach that not even Republicans can support. The likelihood of reaching no deal and operating on continuing resolutions increases when Republicans start out with an absurd opening bid that its hard-liners fall in love with. Aside from this presidency’s errors, gaffes, missteps and moral failings, voters have every reason to be infuriated by the opportunity cost. The chance for sensible corporate tax reform, innovation in our safety-net programs, adequate funding of the military, a foreign policy course correction (which would include robust support for human rights), investment in infrastructure and human capital and new trade and immigration laws that promote growth goes out the window as Congress spends an entire year on Trump’s scandals and unworkable, failed legislative gambles. Next time perhaps voters will elect experienced people adept at governing. That would be novel.

"GOP agenda was already stalled, markets only found out this week","Sometimes the markets are ahead of the political indicators and sometimes they trail. In the last week, however, financial markets seem to have adjusted to the new political reality of a president under siege much quicker than have the political players, who remain in a state of denial about President Trump’s and the GOP’s ability to push forward with their agenda. The Post reports: “It took the almost daily revelations of potentially impeachable offenses for Wall Street to completely come to terms with the fact that Trump may not be able to deliver all the tax cuts and infrastructure spending and deregulation—oh my!—that it had been counting on.” That realization shook the stock market, which suffered its biggest one-day decline since autumn on Wednesday. (From MarketWatch: “The S&P 500 and Dow industrials on Wednesday posted their largest one-day decline since September as fears over the fallout from turmoil in Washington prompted investors to unload risky assets such as equities. Investors grew increasingly concerned that political turmoil in Washington would delay or prevent President Donald Trump’s tax reforms and other fiscal stimulus measures.”) It also hit the dollar: Wall Street finally started to catch on in the last month, but it’s only now that Trump seems to be self-immolating with metronomic frequency that traders have given up all their dreams of a big, fat Trump stimulus. Which is to say that the dollar is back to where it was on election night. After all, it’s not like a lot of legislation passed during the Watergate hearings. If that’s where we’re headed, then we’re not just talking about tax reform being pushed off until 2018, which was already fraught because election years are where bills go to die, but for the future. That’s because the way things are going, there’s at least a decent chance that Democrats could take back the House in the midterms. Republicans, then, may only have eight or 10 more months to realistically get things done. While Trumpkins talked about “animal spirits” that Trump’s election unlocked, we saw irrational exuberance, a vast overestimation of the competency of the presidency and underappreciation for the divisions within the GOP that made multiple, enormous legislative projects unlikely to succeed. Let’s face it: We’ve seen for months how unable the House is to pass politically popular and substantively sound health-care policy. Congressional representatives have chewed up months on a bill which has no chance of moving in the Senate. In the Senate, it is far from clear that any bill is going to pass. “Sen. Susan Collins says the 13 Republican senators charged with drafting a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act are unlikely to succeed,” reports her home state’s Portland Press Herald. “The committee (that) Republican leadership has convened is going to produce a partisan bill,” Collins told the newspaper. “I disagreed when President Obama produced a partisan bill. That’s not the best way for Republicans to legislate now.” So much for that. The Senate, however slight the chance of success, is going to chew up many more months on health care. Before you know it, we will be into the budget fight with a Sept. 30 deadline. Meanwhile the House is agonizing over tax reform, with no clear path forward. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s testimony in front of the Senate Banking Committee should scare the living daylights out of anyone concerned about the debt. He was clear on the major tax cuts and utterly unforthcoming on how to make up lost revenue. He also suggested that the Treasury would come up with its own estimate on the effects of the plan. Oh, swell. Treasury will sprinkle fairy dust on a budget-buster, pronounce it revenue-neutral and try to con the markets and Congress into accepting a plan that will add trillions more in debt. The odds of getting tax reform completed this year are slim to none. So yes, a complete strike out on major legislative initiatives this year is not only possible but likely. Will anyone be smart enough to come up with a Plan B? Considering how impossible the agenda was to begin with, how paralyzed the White House will be and how divided the GOP is, you would think someone would come up with some ideas to hit singles and doubles, rather than strike out aiming for the fences. What would that look like? A realistic option would include corporate tax reform (not cut) that lowers the rates and broadens the base with no significant revenue loss and no big break for so-called pass-through companies. Another doable endeavor would be an infrastructure and job-training bill. A third would be a targeted health-care bill to address a discrete problem, such as the unavailability of health-care providers in rural areas. In other words, rather than nothing, Congress could recognize reality and produce some modest but important bipartisan legislation. But that would take sober leadership from the White House and competent congressional leadership. If we had that I suppose we wouldn’t be in this fix in the first place. So, yes, the markets have finally figured out this will be an unproductive year. The good news is that with 4.4 percent unemployment and some upward movement on wages, the economy will plod on — so long as Trump doesn’t blunder into a government shutdown, a trade war or a disastrous international incident.

Trump undercuts the latest Trumpcare effort," On Sunday, President Trump told John Dickerson on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that any health-care bill he would support would “guarantee” protection for people with preexisting conditions. “Preexisting conditions are in the bill,” he declared. “And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be.’ ” Politico, like a number of outlets, pointed out that this is a “shift from language in the Republican replacement bill circulating in the House.” That will surprise Republicans whipping the vote. (CNN noted, “The amendment would allow states to seek waivers to weaken several key Obamacare insurance reforms that protect those with pre-existing conditions, including the benefits insurers must cover in their policies and the ban on allowing carriers to charge more based on a person’s health background.”) Moreover, Trump suggested that the bill is still changing. This, too, should come as a shock to House Republicans, who thought they reached a final deal last week that gives states the right to opt out of several of the Obamacare protections. It is not clear if Trump is confused about what is in the bill or thinks the negotiations should continue until his “mandate” (which is the Obamacare mandate, to be clear) is secured. If what he is referring to is the provision that says states can opt out of equal treatment for those with preexisting conditions (so-called community ratings), then the amendment authored by Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.) fails. Their amendment says that states can opt out of the protection for preexisting coverage if they have a so-called high-risk pool. But there is no limit on what those pools can charge, nor is there a federal guarantee of funding. (The bill provides $15 billion but does not say what happens if that money runs out.) Trump also insists that premiums will go down. (In Trumpcare, many of Trump’s own voters — older and rural Americans — will pay more.) Perhaps if aides put a map in front of him, as they did with the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), showing how many of his supporters would be adversely affected, he would change his mind. To be fair, Trump is not the only Republican confused about high-risk pools. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) often asserts that high-risk pools are the solution to coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions. Nothing in the experience of these pools suggests that this is the case, however. Kaiser Health News reported last November: More than half of state high-risk insurance pools have closed in the past few years, according to data from the National Association of State Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans (NASCHIP). In other state-run high-risk pools, new enrollment has stopped and overall participation has dropped, the data showed. Premiums ranged from 125% to 200% of the average individual market rate in a given state, according to NASCHIP. … “High-risk pools segregate sick people into plans that are more expensive to both the government and the individual,” said Anthony Wright of Health Access, a coalition of consumer advocates. Wright said the high-risk pools were among the “failures” in the health care system that led to Obamacare. The experience in California was illustrative. Not only did costs soar, but also gigantic waiting lists formed and the coverage included many limitations that Obamacare currently prohibits (e.g. annual and lifetime limits). Now if you mandated that the pools could not charge more than the average rate in the state and provided a funding stream to guarantee coverage, that would be a different matter. But it would also be ferociously expensive, and in the language of Obamacare critics, set up a “new entitlement.” House Republicans and the president do not appear to be on the same page. If Trump “mandates” protection for preexisting conditions and says his bill must lower premiums, the latest bill does not do it. Someone should tell the president — or tell House Republicans to keep negotiating.
