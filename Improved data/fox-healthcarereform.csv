Romney for President? What's a Tea Party Voter to Do in 2012?,"Having spent the last several days in the Granite State I am even more puzzled now than I was late last week when I began pondering this new reality: ""The Tea Party is dead.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I don't know what happened between November of 2010 and January of 2012. Does anyone?                
                

            
                How else do you explain it?                
                

            
                Rewind to November of 2010, race after race, congressional seat after congressional seat, governorship after governorship.                 
                

            
                Only a little more than eighteen months after President Obama had packed the mall in Washington for his historic inaugural, The Tea Party held it's historic event in which nearly the same size audience--according to maps supplied by the USA Today--had attended. That event catapulted a state by state tsunami-like momentum where grassroots, low tax, small government, pro-founding principles, pro-life, pro-national security, and pro-God forces aligned and an election victory of historic equivalence shook America in 2010.                
                

            
                The driving force of that agitation then as it is still today was the effect of a poor economy, government intervention, federal overreach, bureaucratic mandates, and punitive taxes on the nation's beleaguered small business community. Entitlements, bail-outs, and criminally reckless spending ensued.                
                

            
                The Tea Party believed that the buffoons authoring the mess should be dealt a blow. And in 2010 they leveled power in the Congress.                
                

            
                The single biggest example of this overreach was for Washington politicians, behind closed doors, with no transparency, to take a health care reform law--deem it as passed--and force upon the American people the worst piece of legislation to be passed since World War II.                
                

            
                ""ObamaCare"", as it would soon be called, was and is at this very moment--in this election cycle--the singular most visible sign that this nation must take a different course.                
                

            
                Some very good people got elected in 2010 to attempt to help lay the groundwork for the complete repeal of ObamaCare. Rising star Governor Nikki Haley in South Carolina, and Senator-soon-to-be-the-next-Vice-President Marco Rubio rode the shoulders of these Tea Party votes, and pledged with their victories to return power to the voice of ""We the People."" The failed candidacies of Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell were also propped up almost entirely by the support of these first amendment patriots who simply wished to keep government in check.                
                

            
                Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin rallied these troops, showed up and helped them raise cash, enthusiasm, and enlistments.'                
                

            
                 The numbers of the Tea Party were tens of thousands of times bigger than the largest Occupy Wall Street gatherings--combined!                
                

            
                Yet only a little over a year later and the goal of the Tea Party to complete it's work and overturn ObamaCare is all but dead.                
                

            
                In 2010 Ann Coulter was making speeches at CPAC warning that if we chose the candidate who had authored ObamaCare to become the nominee, then President Obama would be easily re-elected. She was right of course.                
                

            
                But somewhere along the line instead of being bold, defiant, grassroots, and in control, someone started feeding voters the meme that the man who saw to it that $50 state-subsidized abortions were included in his vision of mandated government health care, was the best of the available choices.                
                

            
                Even Ann Coulter 2.0 drank the Kool-Aid.                
                

            
                Worse yet the choices that are left in the race are establishment folks who feasted on earmarks for a living in Pennsylvania, embraced government involvement in the biggest hoax of our time--man-made global warming, or finally the man that as governor of Massachusetts raised taxes on everything from gasoline to ""certificates of blindness."" (No it's real... Look it up.)                
                

            
                Your humble correspondant has predicted an easy path that Obama's forces will take to pummel him the candidacy of Mitt Romney into tapioca.                
                

            
                My sources, campaign strategists who consult for the Obama team, confirm that the White House is getting the GOP candidate it wants most.                
                

            
                I need to remind you that the win in Iowa meant strategically nothing. Those delegates will go to whoever the likely nominee is, and won't even be assigned until the convention.                 
                

            
                New Hampshire has a puny amount of delegate votes--but at least they will be genuine delegates.                 
                

            
                This year South Carolina is where the battle truly begins. South Carolina has more delegates than Iowa and New Hampshire combined and Tea Party strongholds from Virginia all the way around the coast to Texas are delegate rich battlegrounds.                
                

            
                The two biggest priorities for primary voters are to decide which candidate can make Washington as inconsequential to the life of the average American as possible, and who can challenge President Obama directly on the worst legislation of our time--ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney has no track record that would point to being able to accomplish either of these. Even a small whiff of a challenge on ObamaCare by Romney will be followed up with an Obama ""thank you"" note for writing the health care law for him.                
                

            
                It is almost impossible to believe and downright sickening to accept that in light of the clear mandate of the Tea Party that the GOP stands on the cusp of returning to ""establishmentarianism."" But it appears that for all the big talk, tens of thousands of local rallies, and the single largest non-inaugural event to ever occur on our nation's mall, the Tea Party has died.                
                

            
                Which is sad. And it's sad for me personally as a supporter, because I believed in the movement and I even addressed those patriots, on that mall, that cloudy Washington day.                
                

            
                That first tea party in Washington took place exactly three days after President Obama's address to a Joint Session of Congress, where he had instructed his supporters on ObamaCare to go ""get in people's faces"" if they disagreed with the policy. He told his critics that he was calling them out.                
                

            
                I remember bringing that little point to the attention of the close to 1.2 million gathered on the mall that afternoon. The chants of ""Here we are, Here we are, Here we are"" rang in my ears for days.                
                

            
                Sadly now I wonder, ""Where'd we go?""

                Change is finally coming to America. Despite warnings from opponents of comprehensive immigration reform, President Obama is on the verge of using his executive power to do what Congress has failed to do: address some of the most egregious injustices in our immigration system. Not only is the president well within his constitutional rights to act, but also in doing so he is defending some of America’s most important values.

                For advocates of comprehensive immigration reform, these last six years have been difficult. The White House and Congress have each insisted that they understand the importance of reforming our immigration system only to have anti-immigrant voices or some other issue (the financial crisis, health care reform, etc.) undercut it. With just two years remaining in his presidency, President Obama, in particular, risks failing to deliver on the promise of one of his most important policy objectives. Time is short and we expect the president to act boldly and decisively.                
                

            
                It would certainly be better if the solution to our current immigration problems were the product of bipartisan collaboration and consensus. But the truth is that President Obama confronts one of the most deeply divided congresses in American history. For years, many Republicans in Congress and some Democrats too, have either dragged their feet on immigration reform or flat out refused to negotiate in good faith with the White House. The result of this political impasse has been a dramatic increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants and a series of other enforcement measures that have inflicted great harm and pain to immigrant families and communities. In the lead-up to the midterm elections, President Obama said that while he hoped that he could work with the new Congress on immigration reform, he was prepared to use executive actions to accomplish what Congress would not. The results of the elections suggest that the president will have few partners to work alongside him in a bipartisan fashion. Simply put, if the worst parts of our immigration system are to be addressed in the next two years, it will most likely be because of the actions of the president.                
                

            
                Opponents of executive action say the president lacks the legal authority to “go it alone.” They’re wrong. Historical precedent shows that presidents—from Harry Truman to Ronald Reagan to Bill Clinton—have used their executive authority to change immigration policy. What’s more, in many of these cases, presidential action has actually spurred Congress to produce meaningful legislation. We certainly hope that's the case, because as important as the president's planned actions on immigration are, they will only represent a temporary fix that address certain aspects of our broken immigration system.                
                

            
                The truth is also that both parties in Congress have had ample time to craft a comprehensive reform strategy that honors America’s values, protects communities, and keeps families together. In the absence of any leadership from Congress, the president has a moral obligation to use executive action to provide relief to millions of immigrant families in the United States.

                The president's executive order must take aim at the most unjust elements of the current system. This is not the time to tinker with the system but to act confidently, courageously, and unapologetically in favor of reform.                 
                

            
                Meaningful executive action would include, for instance, an immediate suspension of deportations for undocumented immigrants who pose no threat to our security, as well as broad administrative relief for the overwhelming majority of the nation’s eleven million undocumented residents to remain and work here legally.                 
                

            
                Moreover, the president’s plan should go beyond solely covering immediate relatives of citizens, legal permanent residents and DACA recipients and not be limited to those residing here for 10 years or more. Access to affordable health care should also be an integral part of this plan to improve the public health of all our families and communities.                
                

            
                There are eleven million undocumented immigrants in America. They are our neighbors, our co-workers, our friends, and our families. They can’t wait another day for justice and neither should the president. The time for change is now.

Saving Medicare By Killing It,"“Dire Forecast Sparks New Medicare Debate” was the headline… June 6, 1996. In fact, according to Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn, Medicare’s immediate extinction has been predicted no fewer than 18 times in the last 40 years. When it serves their political interests, the Chicken Littles from both parties squawk about how the nation’s insanely popular (albeit effectively socialized) medical system is going to go broke any moment.

The fact that none of these predictions has ever come true is not stopping Republicans today. They are using the latest Medicare trust fund forecasts to make a truly sick argument: Medicare might be in trouble eventually so, just to be safe, we’re going to destroy it now.

The facts are not in dispute. The Republican budget plan will double the out-of-pocket cost that seniors pay for health care by 2022. Meanwhile, instead of participating in a large government-backed group plan that brings with it economies of scale cost-wise, seniors will be left on their own to negotiate individually with private insurance companies. The “savings” from the Republican plan will partly go to the insurance industry in the form of vouchers and the rest will go to tax breaks for the richest of the rich.

In fact, the Republican budget which is being pushed under the guise that our nation’s deficit has reached a crisis point, will only reduce the deficit by 0.16% over the next 10 years. Over 70% of the “savings” from slashing Medicare and other public programs that help working families will go not to paying down our debt but, rather, giving more tax breaks to the rich. The same people who, according to several independent sources, are paying lower taxes than most ordinary Americans --- and paying the lowest overall tax rate in at least the last century.

It’s hard to now see Republicans, who have attacked Medicare since its very inception, now pretending to defend it. If Republicans had really wanted to strengthen Medicare, they might have supported at least one of the 60 pieces of legislation over the past 10 years to make the program better. Or they might have supported President Obama’s health care reform legislation, which will strengthen Medicare (and improve trust fund forecasts) but cutting excessive spending by 25%.

Frankly, the only thing that will be healthier under the Republican plan will be the bank accounts of insurance executives. Because their profits aren’t already high enough, they’ll now get government subsidies.

If Chicken Little had been a life-long anti-sky activist hell bent on destroying the atmosphere, even fictitious characters would have been nuts to believe her when she screamed about the sky falling, seeing right through her self-serving tricks.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Similarly, since Republicans have spent most of their political existence railing against government in general and Medicare in specific, we’d be crazy to trust them to honestly diagnose the situation --- let alone solve it. After all, the Republican leaders are as genuinely concerned about the long-term health of Medicare as profit-hungry insurance corporations are concerned about your health.

Olive Garden serves up better menu of health insurance options,"(AP)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Recently, Sears and Darden Restaurants (the parent company of Red Lobster and Olive Garden) revealed plans to change how they provide benefits to their workers. Instead of selecting a plan for the workers, the two companies will give them cash directly to purchase insurance from an online marketplace. Creating private insurance exchanges is a simple but potentially game-changing approach to health insurance coverage.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Private exchanges put choice back in the hands of employees. Those who want cheaper plans with lower coverage pay less; those who want more comprehensive coverage will pay more.                
                

            
                Employees will see exactly what their plan costs and the coverage they receive, allowing them to make smarter choices with their money. And existing federal rules (pre-ObamaCare) for group insurance ensure that employees won’t be charged higher prices if they become sick and can’t be denied coverage if they change jobs and shift to the individual insurance market, as long as they keep their coverage current.                
                

            
                Though similar in name, ObamaCare, aka the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) takes the basic idea of market-based health-insurance exchanges and buries it beneath a morass of new taxes and heavy-handed regulations                
                

            
                Supporters claim that PPACA applies market principles to help control health costs. The health-insurance exchanges the law establishes allow uninsured individuals to purchase insurance using a combination of their own money and federal premium subsidies (and in some cases cost-sharing subsidies) that scale with income (up to 400% of the federal poverty line). So nominally at least, PPACA does harness market forces. But there are some very important caveats.                
                

            
                For starters, the exchanges are loaded with regulations and taxes that will drive up the cost of insurance in the individual and small-group markets. PPACA’s minimum-coverage provisions (called “essential health benefits”) include coverage for mental-health and substance-abuse services, rehabilitative and habilitative services, medical devices, and pediatric dental and vision care. This is a significantly richer and more costly set of benefits than is commonly sold to individuals and small businesses today. The CBO estimates that premiums will rise by close to 30 percent because of this.                
                

            
                PPACA also limits insurers’ ability to offer lower prices to younger and healthier applicants or charge higher prices to sicker and older enrollees. This restriction will also drive insurance prices up, particularly for the young, healthy people that we should be encouraging to buy (and keep) insurance.                
                

            
                Finally, PPACA includes billions in taxes on insurers, drug companies, and medical-device companies that will be mostly passed on to consumers in the form of higher insurance premiums. Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the insurance tax alone will add close to $400 annually to family premiums in 2016. Because the taxes require aggregate amounts to be collected from insurance companies – $14 billion by 2018 – if one insurer’s payout declines, other insurers have to make up the difference. PPACA’s tax structure will likely motivate insurers to merge—reducing competition and further driving up costs for consumers.
 
 Even its supporters admit that PPACA will drive costs up. Although he previously said that PPACA would “for sure” will lower costs, former Obama administration health advisor Jonathan Gruber now admits that the law will drive up individual insurance premiums – by 40% in Maine and Minnesota, and by 20% in Colorado. Other analysts predict increases of as much as 85% in Ohio and 95% in Indiana. Rates for small businesses are expected to rise as well, although not as much.
 
 Creating private, employer-based insurance exchanges is a great start.  Private exchanges are much better positioned to offer high quality coverage without new taxes and expensive new regulations.  And new insurance reform proposals offered by the GOP’s Romney-Ryan ticket would improve them even further.
 
 Employer-based exchange plans remain group plans, and if employees lose their jobs they’d have to pay the full cost of coverage out of pocket, without the tax benefit that comes with employer-based coverage.  Individuals may also face higher prices in the individual market later if they become sick. The rules vary by state.                
                

            
                Here’s where sensible reforms suggested by Governor Romney and Paul Ryan would improve the market while avoiding PPACA’s high costs.                 
                

            
                First, insurance policies have to be truly portable. Romney-Ryan would level the playing field by giving individually-purchased health plans the same tax advantage that employer health plans receive, making insurance much more affordable.                 
                

            
                Second, they’d also reform insurance rules to ensure that as long as you kept your coverage, you wouldn’t have to worry about paying a higher price if you got sick.                
                

            
                This would encourage more companies to open insurance exchanges and help their employees navigate them to find the best value. States wouldn’t have to spend money to open their own exchanges – although they could opt to, if it made sense in their local markets. High-risk pools could be created with relatively modest funding from Washington for the small number of people with pre-existing conditions who can’t find affordable coverage.                
                

            
                By repealing PPACA’s expensive regulations and taxes, the Romney-Ryan plan would also help lower the cost of health insurance. And by creating rules permitting the purchase of insurance across state lines, the GOP plan would help individuals find more affordable plans that fit their families’ needs – without being told what they have to purchase by lobbyists and bureaucrats in Washington.                
                

            
                Private health-insurance exchanges can serve as a model for real health-care reform – especially if the insurance they sell is made truly portable while protecting individuals from future rate increases as long as they stayed insured. It’s a simple, elegant approach that would improve American health care at low cost.

"President Obama, if you'll take on insider trading will you also deal with crony capitalism?","FILE -- Jan. 24, 2013: President Obama delivers his State of the Union address on Capitol Hill, as Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker John Boehner, right, applaud.

                Dear President Obama,                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I watched your State of the Union address on Tuesday night and I want to welcome you aboard the reform train. You had some pointed things to say about congressional insider trading, which was a center point of my book ""Throw Them All Out"" which was published last November.                 
                

            
                I laid out how former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was getting rich off of stock IPOs and how her predecessor Dennis Hastert had a sweetheart land deal that included earmarks to build a highway near some land he bought.                 
                

            
                ""60 Minutes"" did a great story on the book in mid-November.                 
                

            
                Hastert wouldn’t talk to them.                 
                

            
                Pelosi probably wishes she hadn’t. She looked petrified as Steve Kroft was grilling her.                 
                

            
                My advice to politicians in Washington is this: if ""60 Minutes"" shows up at one of your press conferences, it's probably not a good idea to let them ask you a question.                
                

            
                I described the flurry of stock trades that people on both sides of the aisle were making while they were crafting and debating your health care reform legislation (ObamaCare) in 2009.                 
                

            
                And I disclosed how Congressman Spencer Bachus of Alabama actually bought stock options to short the market after he got a private briefing from the Fed Reserve chairman and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner during the financial crisis.                 
                

            
                From where you were standing, can you tell me if any of these people stood and applauded when you called for a ban on insider trading? I can’t tell from the video.                
                

            
                I imagine that you (or more accurately your staff) read at least some of the chapters. Your two proposed solutions to the problem came straight out of the last chapter in my book.                 
                

            
                For example, you called for making congressional insider trading illegal (which I mention on page 174) as well as preventing members of congress from trading stock in companies that fall under the purview of their committees.                 
                

            
                I also proposed that legislation on page 174. Glad to know you think these are good ideas.                
                

            
                I subscribe to Ronald Reagan’s philosophy, “It’s amazing what you can get accomplished so long as you don’t worry about who gets the credit.” So as long as real reforms get passed, I don’t care who gets the credit.                 
                

            
                Although I must say that some analysts are now trying to co-opt this issue.                 
                

            
                I did find it quite funny as I listened to MSNBC's Chris Matthews in his post-speech analysis say about this problem, “I have never heard any reference to it before in my life.”                 
                

            
                Is he living in a bubble?                 
                

            
                I guess he doesn’t watch ""60 Minutes,"" Fox News, or even programming on his own network! All of these media outlets did extensive coverage on the book. Or maybe he didn't read Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times, etc. all of these publications wrote about it.                
                

            
                My hope, Mr. President is that congressional leaders of both parties will get these reforms done as quickly as possible so that we can prevent members of congress from enriching themselves in this way.                
                

            
                I must say, however, I was disappointed that you called for reforming Congress, but not your administration.                 
                

            
                In my book I point out that crony capitalism is a problem in the executive branch, too. (Maybe you skimmed over this part of the book?) In the State of Union address you continued to push government programs for green energy.                 
                

            
                But in Chapter 5 of ""Throw Them All Out,"" I demonstrated in great detail how your Department of Energy sent most of this money to wealthy individuals who funded your campaign in 2008.                 
                

            
                I found at least 10 members of your national finance committee and at least a dozen bundlers who got sweetheart deals. (You can find the names in my book on pages 88, 100-1. I’m sure these names will be familiar to you. They are the same people who are currently raising money for your reelection.)                
                

            
                Yes, it’s good that you took on congressional insider trading. Thank you for doing so. But why not also deal with crony capitalism in your administration? I hope you are not going to use this push for reform just to score political points.

Sincerely,

              The Democratic Party is a mess. It has no effective national leader. It has no serious agenda. And Democrats have no idea how to win back the Rust Belt voters who propelled the ultimate political outsider, Donald J. Trump, to the presidency.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              During President Obama’s eight years in office the Democrats became primarily a coastal party that caters to out-of-touch wealthy elitists in liberal enclaves like Manhattan and Hollywood, while ignoring the hardworking Americans who are the backbone of our country.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats lost election after election during the Obama years, as voters strongly rejected the party’s bankrupt policies. In fact, according to a Fox News report, President Obama’s tenure was marked by an embarrassing “net loss of 1,042 state and federal Democratic posts, including congressional and state legislative seats, governorships and the presidency.”  
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Forgotten voters in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina – whose families had voted for Democrats since President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s time – have finally had enough. They feel like they’ve lost their country and that their leaders in Washington have lost faith in them.

              Then Donald Trump came into their communities, talking America First, American jobs, and American exceptionalism. Trump has backed those words up with an optimistic agenda anchored on the central promise to get Americans working again. The Make American Great Again effort is focused on reform: tax reform, trade reform, regulatory reform, domestic energy production reform, and health care reform.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Just a few days ago, nine months since being shell-shocked by the epic Trump victory, the Democrats rolled out a new, weak agenda. Washington Democrats clearly felt pressure to put forth something – anything – new because their allies in the mainstream media told them they needed to put new wrapping paper on their old and failed ideas.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that only 37 percent of the American people think that the Democratic Party stands for something. And 52 percent said all that the Democrats do is oppose President Trump. This polling data reflects reality. President Trump has been in office for six months and the Democrats up until now have done nothing more than run a permanent obstruction campaign against the president and his agenda.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The truth is that Americans hailing from states that President Trump carried have well-founded beliefs about what today’s Democrat Party stands for – and it’s not good. These folks think that the Democrats are the party of big government, bureaucratic decision-making, high taxes, open borders, abortion on demand, and weakness around the globe. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I will go a step further and offer what I hear from the liberals in Washington and in the mainstream media about what I would call the real Democrat agenda:

Democrats in freefall and destructive stupidity of GOP leadership is on full display,"Now Playing                            What could House passing immigration reform mean for GOP?                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                So. The Democrats are in freefall. Their ""landmark"" legislation -- ObamaCare, rammed through without a single Republican vote -- is in collapse. The president has been exposed as a liar (see: ""If you like your health plan, you can keep it. Period."").

                In other words, the Democrats are on the run, vulnerable, weak, and poised for a major defeat.

                So what are the Republicans doing? Are they going for the jugular, attacking nonstop until November and showing no mercy? (In other words, acting like Democrats...) Of course not. They're Republicans. They are stepping in to help the Dems out.                 
                

            
                Instead of pounding ObamaCare and the president and the Democrats with the facts of an atrocious stab at socialized medicine and the lies they've used to push it, the GOP appears ready to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by switching gears to the highly polarizing issue of immigration.                 
                

            
                Never mind that immigration doesn't even score more than 2 percent in polls asking what the most important issue is to the country. Rather than let this sleeping dog lie (at least through November), the Republican leadership is jumping to the assistance of the Democrats by supporting amnesty.                
                

            
                Remember this CRITICAL POINT: For Obama and the left, no issue is about the stated issue. It's ALWAYS about something bigger and more profound – namely, as Obama put it in 2008, ""the fundamental transformation of the nation.""                 
                

            
                So, for the left, health care ""reform"" was never about health care or health insurance. It was only and always about using the huge health care sector (1/6th of the U.S. economy) as a lever to transform the broader economy into a European-style socialist model. For one simple reason: if the government controls your health care, the government controls you.                
                

            
                ObamaCare was never about your health care. It was about government power and control.                
                

            
                And so it is with immigration ""reform."" For Obama and the Left, it's not about actually dealing forcefully and effectively with the immigration issue.                 
                

            
                If that were the case, the administration would be faithfully enforcing the laws we have on the books. It is not.                 
                

            
                They seek this ""reform"" for one simple reason: because immigration is the final missing piece of the ""fundamental transformation of the nation.""                 
                

            
                If they can get amnesty for 12 million (who knows what the real number is? 12 million? 18 million? 30 million?) illegals, they know they’ve got the country in a headlock. Most Hispanics are natural Democrat voters.                
                

            
                Not all, obviously. Many believe in hard work, individual liberty, economic liberty, and obeying the law.                
                

            
                But the majority vote Democrat, and the party has been working hard to lock them into government dependency.                 
                

            
                If amnesty goes through, the Democrats will flood the zone with millions of more Democrat voters, possibly flip Texas blue, and get their long-sought-after permanent Democrat voting majority.                 
                

            
                If that happens, you will never again see a Ronald Reagan or a George W. Bush. You may never again see a GOP majority in Congress. The Republicans will be relegated to permanent minority status. And a shrinking one at that.                
                

            
                This is the goal of the Democrats. Why on earth would Republicans want to help them achieve it?                
                

            
                Because they think they'll be ""rewarded"" by Hispanic voters?                 
                

            
                That didn't happen after the 1986 amnesty. In fact, the percentage of Hispanics voting GOP actually went DOWN after that amnesty.                 
                

            
                To take the issue off the table? Forget it. As soon as the path to amnesty is in place, Democrats will accelerate the process to get them voting as fast as possible, so the ""issue"" will never be off the table for Republicans.                
                

            
                Obama and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and Organizing for Action and George Soros and Eva Longoria and everyone else on the extreme left must be laughing out loud at the pure, destructive stupidity of the Republicans. They've got the Democrats on the ropes, and they're throwing them a lifeline.                
                

            
                While strangling themselves right out of existence.

                As the 115th Congress begins, I am honored to assume a new role as Interim Chair of the House Budget Committee.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is an exciting opportunity, particularly as the first woman to fill the position, but more than any title before my name, I’m still most proud of the two letters that follow: “R.N.”                
                

            
                I graduated from nursing school in 1971 and still keep my license today. Those years on the front lines of patient care, primarily in emergency room settings, inform much of the work I do in Congress – especially when it comes to ObamaCare.                
                

            
                It’s no secret that Congressional Republicans aren’t keen on former President Obama’s health care law (of course, recent polling shows that a majority of Americans still aren’t either) but, for me, the debate has never been about politics. It’s personal.                
                

            
                As a nurse, I saw the impact of health care decisions in Washington play out every day on my patients’ faces and in their billing statements.                
                

            
                I understand the need for healthcare reform as well as anyone, but ObamaCare wasn’t the way to do it – and nowhere is that more deeply felt than in my home state of Tennessee.                
                

            
                In 2013, 28,000 Tennesseans lost their insurance coverage in a single day when a state program called “CoverTN” lapsed after the Obama administration decreed that it ran afoul of the health care law’s top-down requirements.                
                

            
                Two years later, our state’s ObamaCare co-op would follow suit, leaving thousands in a scramble for coverage.                
                

            
                Today, Tennesseans are seeing an average 63 percent premium spike and 73 of our 95 counties have a single option to choose from on the Obamacare exchange.                
                

            
                Our state insurance commissioner didn’t mince words last year when she described the marketplace as “very near collapse” but even that characterization is generous. When three-fourths of your state lacks any choice among insurers, it’s no longer a marketplace at all – it’s a monopoly.                
                

            
                Sadly, Tennessee has seen this movie before, and we know exactly how it ends. A similar government-run program, called TennCare, failed in our state less than 15 years ago.                
                

            
                First enacted in 1994, this program dramatically expanded Medicaid eligibility to just about anyone that wanted it, including healthy, insurable adults who simply lacked employer-sponsored coverage.                
                

            
                Costs for TennCare quickly exploded, rising 146 percent over a ten-year window with little to show in the way of improved health outcomes.                
                

            
                In 2001, BlueCross Blue Shield, which covered half of all TennCare patients, threatened to pull out of the program because of massive losses and, by 2004, an independent audit revealed TennCare was on track to bankrupt Tennessee.                
                

            
                Like ObamaCare, TennCare couldn’t deliver on its promises. Both programs found themselves mired in court cases, unable to attract healthy adults, struggling to keep insurers, crippled by a lack of proper verification for eligibility, and ultimately failing to bend the health care cost curve.                
                

            
                It was ultimately a Democrat Governor, Phil Bredesen, who scaled back TennCare to a traditional Medicaid model, admitting “Our experience with trying to do universal coverage ended up being a disaster.""                
                

            
                Now, Tennesseans are experiencing a bad case of déjà vu.                
                

            
                Following the clear mandate from American voters last fall – and keeping the lessons of TennCare in mind – Congressional Republicans recently took the first steps towards the repeal of ObamaCare.                
                

            
                The debate on the House floor over the legislation was spirited, with Democrats claiming that supporters of repeal are pulling the rug out from millions of Americans, but their argument falls short.                
                

            
                For every person that ObamaCare loyalists claim has been helped by this law, another has opted out of the law altogether. Indeed, between the number of people who claimed an exemption from ObamaCare penalties and those who paid the fines – some 20 million Americans are rejecting ObamaCare outright.                
                

            
                Washington types fail to understand that by repealing and replacing ObamaCare, we are not disrupting a system that is working, we are offering a rescue plan to stop the bleeding and transition away from a law that already failed by every measure. That also means offering a stable transition period, so that no one falls through the cracks, and then offering a path to something better.                
                

            
                If President Obama’s infamous pledge that “If you like your plan, you can keep it” was the greatest lie surrounding ObamaCare, then a close second is the claim that Republicans have no alternative.                
                

            
                For example, Speaker Paul Ryan filed the Patients Choice Act during the same session of Congress ObamaCare was passed. Unsurprisingly, the Democratic majority wouldn’t give the bill consideration.                
                

            
                More recently, my Tennessee colleague, Congressman Phil Roe, a physician by trade, offered the American Health Care Reform Act and Congressman Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon, introduced the Empowering Patients First Act.                
                

            
                While the exact details of these bills vary, they all center on solutions that expand choice, force insurers to compete for patients’ business, protect our most vulnerable, and work to drive down the cost of care.                
                

            
                Last summer, House Republicans put many of these solutions together in a detailed, 37-page policy blueprint called “A Better Way” for health care reform.                
                

            
                The House will legislate on an ObamaCare replacement bill that meets the contours of that plan this year.                
                

            
                Nearly seven years after ObamaCare became law on a party line vote, we can say with certainty that we’ve tried health care reform the Washington way and it didn’t work.                
                

            
                Now, it’s time to try a better way – with solutions that trust patients over politicians and that offer Americans the care they want without forcing them to buy into a product they don’t need.

On MLK Day -- A look at race and the 2012 presidential campaign,"It is Martin Luther King Day, and a good time to look at how racial politics is being played this year when the first black president in U.S. history is seeking reelection.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The big news about racial politics in 2012 is that generational politics are now a critical factor in any analysis of America’s longstanding racial divide.                
                

            
                Young people, disproportionately minorities and immigrants, are growing in numbers. These people of color, younger than 18, are already a quarter of the population. And when you add in people under age 32, younger people make up half of the nation. They are big fans of Democrats and President Obama.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, those 65 and older constitute only about 15 percent of the population. But they are overwhelmingly white and much more politically active. They don’t like Obama. They are a boon to the GOP.                
                

            
                Those white seniors don’t like being branded as racists for their dislike of the first black president, but as Time magazine recently reported, the seniors’ disapproval of the black president is “dramatically higher” than among younger white people.                
                

            
                A Pew poll showed voters younger than 30 favored Obama over the probable GOP nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 61 percent to 37 percent. Seniors favored Romney over Obama, 54 percent to 41 percent.                
                

            
                That Grand Canyon-wide gap between more racially diverse younger Americans and solidly white older Americans is also evident in every analysis of public reaction to Obama’s signature legislation — health care reform. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found a stunning 50 percent of seniors opposed to the plan.                
                

            
                On the other side of the racial and political divide, there is little chance that black voters will support a 92 percent white Republican Party trying to oust the first black president. The GOP’s only hope among the ever-increasing number of young and minority voters is to win over the fastest growing racial group in the United States — Hispanics.                
                

            
                A Pew Hispanic Center survey showed Democrats currently hold a 47-point party-identification advantage with Hispanic voters, the biggest gap in more than a decade. The same survey also found Hispanics favoring Obama over Romney, 68 percent to 23 percent. And this was way before Romney announced he would veto the DREAM Act, which some polls show is supported by 91 percent of Hispanics.                
                

            
                Obama won 67 percent of the Hispanic vote and 95 percent of the black vote in 2008. It is very likely he will retain or even increase those shares in 2012.                
                

            
                The increasing presence of Hispanics, blacks and immigrants in the electorate means a constant infusion of likely Democratic voters in this election and beyond. The increasingly critical role of Hispanic voters explains the enthusiasm in the GOP for drafting Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a young Hispanic, as the party’s vice presidential candidate this year.                
                

            
                It also explains why the GOP is trying to depress Hispanic and black voter turnout. Racial politics has a long history in South Carolina — it is the state where Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was falsely accused of having fathered a black child out of wedlock. And who would have predicted that in the heat of the campaign, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) would be willing to appear on the same stage with the leading black Democrat in the state, Rep. James Clyburn.                
                

            
                Last year, South Carolina followed the lead of several other GOP-controlled states by enacting new laws to require voters to show government-issued photo identification to get into the polling booth. The new law has been blocked by the Justice Department under the 1965 Voting Rights Act, one of the most important victories of Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement.                
                

            
                It was aimed at the sad history of black voter disenfranchisement — from poll taxes to literacy tests — that made politics a whites-only game in states such as South Carolina for most of our nation’s history.                
                

            
                A study by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University found that the new voter identification laws disproportionately affect minorities and young people. In other words, they prevent likely Democratic voters from voting. The study estimated that all these new state laws, taken together, could disenfranchise more than 5 million voters — 25 percent of African Americans don’t have the kind of photo identification that states like South Carolina now require for voting.                
                

            
                South Carolina’s own statistics indicate that 82,000 registered minority voters lack state-issued identification.                
                

            
                Make no mistake about it. This concerted effort by Republicans to disenfranchise Democratic voters is their brazen reaction to the rise of black and Hispanic voters as the lifeblood of the Democratic Party and Obama’s chances for reelection.                
                

            
                I believe if Dr. King were alive he’d be marching against this politically motivated assault on minority voting rights.

		                                Pop star Taylor Swift has a tradition of buying her albums from Target. She kept that tradition alive upon the release of 'Redemption'. Take a look at some of the photos a few lucky shoppers captured.
	                        	
					 
				  
              
            
		 

    





								
								



 



       
       
      
          
              Marie Claire is a women’s magazine that covers health, beauty and fashion. That used to be enough, but, like everything else these days, it has gotten political.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In fact, just being political isn’t enough. Now everyone else has to be political, too.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Thus we get the Marie Claire article by Kayleigh Roberts titled “5 Things Taylor Swift Should Have Addressed on ‘Reputation’ but Didn’t.” (For you non-Swift fans, “Reputation” is her latest album.)
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              The first thing Swift should have addressed, according to the article: “Her Decision To Remain Apolitical During The 2016 Election.”
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            I’m a fan of old movies, but I never say to myself “I wonder if Fred Astaire supported Roosevelt?” or “I wonder if Audrey Hepburn favored economic reform?” 
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              Roberts goes on to explain:
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “Fall of 2016 saw a slew of celebrities get vocally and visibly involved in the political process, supporting candidates and encouraging their fans to get out and vote.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              “After a period of complete silence about the election, Taylor did post on Instagram about the fact she was voting [but not who she was voting for].
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “Whether she likes it or not, Taylor’s politics (or her perceived political apathy) are a part of her reputation, and a song addressing or at least acknowledging that (even if the song did not address her personal politics) would have been impactful.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s true, last year saw a bunch of celebrities did get vocally and visibly involved in politics, but, unlike Roberts, I didn’t think that was something to celebrate.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I’m a fan of old movies, but I never say to myself “I wonder if Fred Astaire supported Roosevelt?” or “I wonder if Audrey Hepburn favored economic reform?” I don’t know the answers to these questions, because back then stars generally kept their beliefs to themselves. But, more importantly, I don’t care what they thought about those issues.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              What I care about, and what most people care about when it comes to celebrities, is how well they entertain us. Having them lecture us on how to vote is not entertaining – in fact, it tends to get in the way of entertainment.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Yet, in recent times, it seems more and more big stars feel the need to share their wisdom with us.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Celebrities, like all of us, are free to believe what they want, but that doesn’t mean they have to let everyone know about it. I’m sure there are a lot of people I pass on the street who could teach me things, but I’d just as soon they don’t buttonhole me to let me know the latest on health-care reform.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Roberts admits Swift can play it how she wants: “Taylor is not required to be open about her politics, of course, but it’s also fair to question her decision to remain silent in what was a particularly contentious and consequential battle.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I have no trouble with – in fact I favor – any celebrity who chooses to remain silent. And this argument is only stronger when the issue is particularly contentious. It makes me wonder if Marie Claire would think it’s so wonderful if Swift was more explicit about her beliefs, but on the side Kayleigh Roberts doesn’t like.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s a politician’s job to take a stance. It’s not an entertainer’s job. (An exception can be made when their politics are part of their art, but even that can be tricky.)
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So sorry, Marie Claire. Maybe Taylor Swift should end her feud with Katy Perry, and maybe her relationship with Tom Hiddleston was a publicity stunt, but as far as her keeping her politics to herself, that’s fine with me.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              One of the glories of our democracy is the secret ballot. I wish more celebrities would take advantage of it.

Cain vs. Obama In 2012 -- It's Not Just a Fantasy,"As Herman Cain’s long shot campaign to become the GOP’s first black presidential nominee continues to gain in the polls he is writing a one-of a-kind Hollywood fantasy. What if both candidates for the White House in 2012, Republican and Democrat, are black?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                And what happens to American politics if a black Republican wins the White House by winning the black vote?                
                

            
                Until now this movie seemed far-fetched. It fit in the same make-believe movie fiction genre as Jimmy Stewart being saved by an angel in the classic make-believe film “It’s a Wonderful Life.”                
                

            
                But since Cain handily won the Florida Republican Party’s straw poll this movie is pushing toward reality.                
                

            
                The latest Fox News national poll puts Cain in a strong third place position in the GOP race. He is statistically tied with Texas Governor Rick Perry for second place. He turned in a great performance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on Friday night and has been all over cable news capitalizing on his surge. His new book, “This is Herman Cain! My Journey to the White House” hits stores this week.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney remains the frontrunner but his campaign seems stuck at about 25 percent of the vote.                 
                

            
                Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann hoped to become the conservative, Tea Party alternative to Romney but they have both faded in the last month.                
                

            
                Meanwhile Cain, the most dynamic speaker of all the candidates, continues to exceed expectations. He has been doing the hard work of organizing and meeting voters in the early states. He seems to be having some staff problems but if he can pull in some big money contributions to combine with his momentum he may be on his way to the nomination.                
                

            
                It is certainly a mistake to dismiss Cain -- as Sarah Palin did last week -- as just “the next flavor of the week.” To be completely fair Palin later said she did not mean to dismiss him as a fluke who will soon return to the bottom of the pack. She said her real target was mainstream media culture that fixates on one candidate only to immediately tear them down. She is right about that – but that’s another column for another day.                
                

            
                In fact, I have said that Cain’s victory in Florida owes a lot to conservative discontent with Perry and Romney. I think he is getting a lot of protest votes.                 
                

            
                But GOP voters I met in Florida last week scolded me and said they support him because he is a real conservative, an inspiring person with an economic plan they understand and experience as a businessman.                 
                

            
                It's safe to say that no matter where this movie goes from here Cain has already flipped the script on the standard racial dialogue in American politics. That happened with his very real and very powerful attacks on the liberal black establishment.                
                

            
                Cain said if he is the GOP’s presidential candidate in 2012 he will win a third of the black vote and end the liberal Democratic hold on black politics. And he said he will do that in a contest against a black Democrat – President Obama.                
                

            
                Cain stuck the knife into black liberals even deeper when he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN:                 
                

            
                “Many African-Americans have been brainwashed into not being open minded, not even considering a [black] conservative point of view. I have received some that same vitriol simply because I am running for the Republican nomination as a conservative. It is just brainwashing and people not being open minded, pure and simple.”                
                

            
                On Fox News Cain added that black voters in Atlanta, his hometown, constantly come up to him and begin whispering. They say they like him and his conservative positions. This happens so often he has started asking them why they are whispering. The answer is that black people fear being ostracized by other black people because they support a conservative – even if he is black.                
                

            
                Speaking on ""Fox News Sunday"" last week Cain said:                 
                

            
                “Anecdotally I run into people all the time and I share my 9-9-9 plan with them. Some black people that I run into – not all –… they won’t even take my little 9-9-9 brochure because [they hear that] I am that conservative, I’m that Republican. I call that being brainwashed. How can they make up their mind against something when they don’t know what it is?”                
                

            
                Cain’s bold comments drew heavy return fire from black leaders on the left. A clearly threatened Rev. Jesse Jackson called Cain’s words “demeaning and insulting” to black people. Jackson said black Americans can think for themselves and see Cain’s conservative positions on the minimum wage and health care reform are not in their political best interest.                
                

            
                Democratic Strategist Cornell Belcher called it a “racist, bigoted statement.” He said if a candidate said Jewish voters were “brainwashed” on the subject of Israel that candidate would be called a bigot and banned from TV.                
                

            
                Cain dismissed the backlash as the predictable retort from a crowd of black liberal Democrat politicians who fear losing their monopoly on black voters. And he issued more fighting words when he said his comments were “not as insensitive as the president of the United States standing in front of a major black audience, the Congressional Black Caucus, and scolding them because his policies have failed the country, his policies have failed black people.”                
                

            
                “That's more insensitive -- that's more insulting to me than me using a term brainwashed. It's their only weapon… to try to silence me because I'm a conservative. It's simply not going to work” he added.                
                

            
                Good for Herman Cain.                
                

            
                Whenever the mainstream media wants to know what the African American community is thinking, they invariably go to the usual liberal voices, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, as if they speak for all black people.                
                

            
                Brilliant black conservative voices are viewed as tokens and inauthentic. That ranges from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas to former transportation Secretary William Coleman, former Housing Secretary Al Jackson, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, author Thomas Sowell, Professor Walter E. Williams and businessman Herman Cain.                
                

            
                After a while, the idea that the GOP will never be able to win back the black vote has become a self fulfilling prophecy. For the last several decades even Republican candidates have given up and not put money into winning the black vote.                
                

            
                It didn’t always used to be that way. In 1956, Republican Dwight Eisenhower won almost 40% of the black vote. Four years later, Richard Nixon won 32% of the vote. The first African American Senator elected by popular vote was a Republican - Ed Brooke of Massachusetts                
                

            
                Cain is a self-made, successful businessman, a radio talk show host and a cancer survivor. But he is also a Baptist preacher and a graduate of Morehouse College, an elite and famous black college. Unlike Barack Obama, his ancestors are slaves who lived through Jim Crow segregation. Don’t forget that four years ago the majority of the Congressional Black Caucus was lined up to support Hillary Clinton.                
                

            
                I do not agree with Herman Cain on many policy issues. For instance, economists both conservatives and liberal agree his 9-9-9 plan will lead to higher tax bills for the middle class and the poor.                
                

            
                But how do you think older black people will vote if they are asked to pick between Cain and Obama. One is a black businessman, preacher and a Southerner and the other is a bi-racial, Ivy League graduate who rarely goes to church, has fewer blacks in his cabinet than George W. Bush and who supports gay rights.                
                

            
                After this week, it is no longer outside the realm of possibilities that the Party of Lincoln will choose a black Republican as their standard bearer to defeat the first black president. Now that’s a blockbuster!

Not Your Grandmother’s Debt Ceiling Debate,"This is not your grandmother’s debt-ceiling debate. While the lid on government borrowings has been raised dozens of times since 1917, when it was first put in place in order to sell war bonds, the current scuffle is different for several reasons. First, the country’s fiscal prospects have never been darker, mainly because Medicare and Social Security payments will rise to unsustainable levels unless the programs are changed. Second, an increasing amount of U.S. debt is being sold overseas, making us vulnerable in ways not yet entirely clear. Third, we have a political force in the country – the Tea Party - that is committed to restraining government spending. For these reasons, the debate is more raucous and more threatening than ever before.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Normally, raising the lid on the country’s borrowings has been accomplished with little fanfare, though some have used the measure as an opportunity to sound fiscal alarm bells, and to score political points. (Ironically, then-Senator Obama weighed in during the 2006 debate with the following remarks: “The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure…It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government’s reckless fiscal policies… This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on.”)                
                

            
                He was right then, and his comments resound today. The country cannot continue to spend at today’s level – at about 25% of GDP, a level last seen during World War II – without crippling our future. Why not? Because outlays at that level cannot be funded by traditional means – taxes and other fees – without undermining the productivity of the nation. Therefore, such a level of spending demands increased borrowings, which in turn leads to a dangerous and suffocating debt level. The rise in obligations means that in several years we will be spending more on interest costs than on Medicare or on defense. That projection was included in the President’s budget, which forecasts that interest rates rise only modestly – almost surely an overly optimistic assumption. This dire outlook has led the ratings agencies – Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s – to threatened a downgrade of our debt, an unprecedented warning.                
                

            
                As we have increased our borrowings, we have turned to foreign lenders. In 2010, 47% of our debt was held by foreigners, up from 19% in 1990 and 5% in 1970. As of the end of May, China held $1.1 trillion in U.S. bonds and notes. Not only does this obligation threaten our balance of power with Beijing, it also makes us vulnerable to a “buyers’ strike.” If, for political reasons, China steps out of the market for any period of time, interest rates would surely rise.                
                

            
                This unprecedented financial insecurity accounts for Republicans’ “intransigence”, as President Obama has described it. GOP legislators are sticking to their guns – demanding serious spending cuts, all the while risking the fury of President Obama and, conceivably, of voters back home. They know the stakes have risen, and they don’t trust Democrats to meaningfully alter the dangerous fiscal path the country is currently traveling. They are quite right to be skeptical. In 1990 President George H.W. Bush caved into raising the debt ceiling with the understanding that Democrats in Congress would cut spending by $2 for every $1 hike in taxes. Bush raised taxes by $137 billion; instead of slicing baseline spending by the agreed $274 billion, outlays actually increased $22 billion from the level estimated by the CBO before the deal was cut.                
                

            
                An urgent appeal went out today from TeaParty365, an outfit based in New York. They oppose House Speaker Boehner’s latest proposal to seal a deal, preferring instead the “cut, cap and balance” bill that earlier passed the House. They criticize the latest Boehner plan because it would allow our debt to expand, and relies on a “special committee” to come up with new spending cuts. They remind supporters that there have been “seventeen special committees since 1982 (that) have left us in the hole we’re in today…”                
                

            
                Most Americans are sick to death of Beltway bickering, and would like this debt ceiling crisis solved. Many have been convinced by President Obama that his is the voice of reason – that a “balanced” approach seems fair. However, the president is misleading the American public. His is not a balanced approach; so far, the president has not committed to any specific spending reductions nor any modifications of the long-term entitlements programs that threaten to ruin our country. Serious fiscal reform, which will invariably trim government largess for some, would not be good for his reelection campaign. It is, however, vital to the country’s future.

"Newt Gingrich: An important, first step towards a next generation health care system","Now Playing                            Will conservatives find compromise on GOP health care plan?                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The ObamaCare repeal bill Republicans presented this week is an important, first step toward achieving a next generation health care system in America.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                For Republicans to meet their commitment to repeal ObamaCare – and to do so in a way that is real, lasting, and substantive – the writers of the American Health Care Act had to closely follow the Senate’s narrow budget reconciliation rules, which strictly limit legislation passed under budget reconciliation.                
                

            
                The Congressional Budget Act – which is the overarching legislation that sets reconciliation rules for both houses of Congress – says reconciliation can only be used on legislation that alters federal spending, revenues or the national debt.                 
                

            
                ObamaCare certainly fits that bill, but rules in the Senate further limit reconciliation bills through a rule named after the late Democratic West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd.                
                

            
                Under the Byrd Rule, at any point during the reconciliation process, any senator can block any bill provision that doesn’t change the budget, spending or debt in specifically measurable ways. Other limitations under the Byrd rule include prohibitions against provisions that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the committees that recommend them, or provisions that in any way change Social Security programs such as disability.                
                

            
                If House lawmakers include provisions that the Senate Parliamentarian finds to be extraneous or unrelated to budgetary matters, Senate Democrats can block them and slow down the Republicans’ momentum. This is the bottleneck through which every provision of the American Health Care Act has to fit.                
                

            
                That’s why the American Healthcare Act is just the first of many steps to come.                
                

            
                Still, even with these limitations, this legislation is better for consumers than our current law.                 
                

            
                This bill will allow Congress and President Trump to eliminate ObamaCare taxes and its mandate that forces people to buy health insurance; strengthen and expand Health Care Savings Accounts to give families more control over their health care spending; reform Medicaid so states can use per-capita block grants to best serve their residents; provide tax credits to people who don’t get insurance through other avenues; and take health care decision-making power away from Washington and return it to patients and doctors.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price will implement dramatic regulatory reforms in the health care sector that will empower states to make health care decisions that are best for their residents while lowering costs.                
                

            
                These regulatory changes must be followed by a series of targeted health care reform bills, which should be much more visionary, more powerful, and have a positive impact on the entire health care system.                
                

            
                The health care system is enormously complex. It addresses many completely unique challenges – each with its own special set of intricacies – and health care accounts for one-fifth of our nation’s economy.                 
                

            
                More importantly, our health care system’s success means life or death for millions of Americans.                 
                

            
                So, a rolling series of focused bills is far better for the American people than one gigantic bill that no one reads or understands.                 
                

            
                Passing future targeted bills will be more difficult if we let President Trump lose this first major fight – we cannot allow that to happen.                
                

            
                The 21st Century Cures Act is an excellent model to follow. The Cures bill was targeted, specific and just under 1,000 pages long. By comparison, ObamaCare drastically changed many aspects of our health care system, was 2,700 pages long and produced more than 20,000 pages of related regulations, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.                
                

            
                The American Health Care Act is the start of a remarkable reinvention of American health care. By 2018, President Trump and the Congress will have made serious progress and we’ll have a dramatically better system for all Americans.

                Here are really big questions for the big presidential debate on domestic policy on October 3rd in Denver.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Let’s begin with three humongous questions for President Obama. That will be followed by three terrifyingly large questions for the challenger Gov. Mitt Romney. Here we go:                
                

            
                1. President Obama, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has given you an “F.” They say the failure is based on your “lack of leadership” the gun control issue.  In your first term, we have had three of the worst mass shootings in US History, (Tucson, Arizona, Aurora Colorado, and Oak Creek, Wisconsin) Could you have done more to stop the spread of assault weapons and gun violence over the last four years?
 
 Will you make gun control a priority in your second term? Are you paralyzed by the National Rifle Association’s political clout?
 
 2. President Obama during the debate over health care reform you said that a “Public Option” -- where the government can compete with private companies to offer low-cost health insurance “should be part of reform.”  A CBS/New York Times poll from earlier this year found that 27 percent of Americans feel your health care reform “did not go far enough.” We already have a form of the “Public Option” for seniors in Medicare. The Veterans’ Administration health program is also a government run option.
 
 Why didn’t you push harder for a “Public Option” for all Americans in your health care reform? Is this something you plan to revisit in your second term?                
                

            
                3. Here is one final question for you, Mr. President. In 2008, you campaigned on a promise to close the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Four years later, the facility is still open. Dozens of suspected terrorists are still being held there. And some intelligence reports suggest that an inmate released from Guantanamo in 2007 may be involved with the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya last month.                
                

            
                Are you prepared to now admit that the prison at Guantanamo Bay is too important a tool in the War on Terror to be closed?                   
                

            
                Now that President Obama has been left dazed by those big questions, here are three monumental inquiries for Romney.                
                

            
                1. Gov. Romney you have promised to reduce the deficit and cut the size of government. That’s great. But you refuse to say how you plan to do that without throwing the economy back into recession. Can you tell us tonight which federal programs you will eliminate right away; which tax deductions and subsidies you plan to eliminate?                
                

            
                2. Gov. Romney, if elected President under what circumstances will you keep US troops in Afghanistan after the end of this year? You are on record as agreeing with President Obama’s timetable for withdrawal by the end of 2014? So, how does your Afghanistan policy differ in any way from President Obama’s unless you secretly believe there might be good reasons for keeping American forces there?                
                

            
                3. Gov. Romney, Israel is America’s top ally in the Middle East. So, do you think American policy in the Middle East should always be based on Israeli concerns and demands? Or should U.S. interest in maintaining stable alliances throughout the region guide U.S. policy in the region?                
                

            
                Don’t leave yet.  Here are two bonus round question for you, governor.                
                

            
                You caused a lot of heartburn among conservatives this summer when you said there are parts of President Obama’s Health Care Reform law that you like and that you would keep in place.                
                

            
                You specifically pointed to two central tenets of the plan: First, requiring that insurance companies cover people with pre-existing conditions. And second allowing children to stay on their parent’s health plans until they are 26. Please tell us now what are the other parts of the president’s new health care law that you would keep in place?
 
 And one more for you, governor: You have repeatedly accused the People’s Republic of China from manipulating its currency and violating U.S. Copyright and Patent Law. You fault President Obama for not being aggressive in stopping China from practicing unfair trade. Realistically, how will you get China to change its policies? Would you be willing to risk damaging the U.S. economy with a trade war with China?
 
 Gentlemen, please pick your jaws up off the floor. We’ll let you know how you did with these questions on Election Day.

"Dear President Trump, please keep your promise -- A doctor's wish for health care","Now Playing                            Lawmakers propose middle ground in battle over ObamaCare                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Dear President Trump:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As a cardiologist, my top priority is the well-being of my patients. During the last eight years, out-of-touch politicians have imposed regulations that created more electronic paperwork and administrative tasks for health care providers, taking me away from what I do best — providing exceptional care for my patients.                
                

            
                Health care in the U.S. is broken. Smaller reimbursements, confusing Medicare filing requirements and adversarial relationships with insurers have limited my ability to connect with my patients. I now spend more time typing, doing clerical work, answering to hospital administrators and arguing with insurance company representatives about how to treat my patients than I do listening to my patients’ hearts.                
                

            
                The implementation of ObamaCare brought on “in-network” provider changes that dissolved many long-term doctor-patient relationships. Those relationships are sacred, and ObamaCare has poisoned them. There is no room for Washington in my exam room. There is no place for members of Congress or other regulators in my operating room. I implore you to make good on your promises and remove government from the health care equation.

                Throughout your campaign, you were a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act, and I am pleased that your first executive order, issued within hours of your inauguration, was aimed at dismantling ObamaCare. I am grateful that your order aggressively begins the process of repealing the ACA. I understand that your order itself cannot repeal the law, but it goes a long way toward eliminating key portions of President Obama’s signature legislation.                
                

            
                Change must come quickly. As a physician and as a patient advocate, I offer these suggestions.                
                

            
                1. Have an immediate replacement. We cannot repeal the ACA without replacing it immediately. Repeal-and-delay will destabilize the insurance market and likely result in even less access and choice for my patients.                
                

            
                2. Eliminate the individual mandate. Forcing Americans to purchase health insurance that is expensive and limited in scope is not freedom of choice. Every citizen should be allowed to choose.                
                

            
                3. Allow insurance plans to compete across state lines. Patients are far more likely to have more choices and be able to negotiate better premium prices in a competitive market. Competition will force insurance companies to provide better services for patients and doctors.                
                

            
                4. Cover pre-existing conditions. We cannot go back to the days when insurers could discriminate against or deny coverage to those with chronic medical conditions. People who have known medical conditions should be able to purchase insurance at the same rate as those who don’t.                
                

            
                5. Take on Big Pharma. We can no longer allow pharmaceutical and medical device companies to price-gouge, and we must hold their CEOs accountable for the pricing of new products. My patients want to get better, but excessive costs — the U.S. has the highest drug prices in the world — often prevent them from complying with their medication schedules. I encourage you to help drive prices down by allowing Americans to buy prescription drugs from reputable Canadian pharmacies.                
                

            
                6. Deregulate health care. Currently, doctors aren’t able to be doctors. We have become scribes. We spend hours in front of computer screens. A recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that on a typical clinic day, physicians spent only 25 percent of their patient interaction making eye contact and connecting with their patients. The remaining 75 percent of the patient interaction was spent filling out government-mandated electronic medical records.                
                

            
                7. Require patient responsibility. Preventive health practices should be a cornerstone of health insurance coverage. When patients actively participate in their health care and treatment plans, their outcomes improve. Offer lower premiums to those who exercise, diet and quit smoking. Health care reform must require patients to “buy in.”                
                

            
                8. Limit malpractice claims. Tort reform on the federal level is essential to lowering health care costs. Many physicians order unnecessary tests in order to avoid “missing something” that could result in a lawsuit. “Defensive medicine” drives up costs and puts patients at risk of unnecessary complications.                
                

            
                As you begin your first 100 days, I hope you can motivate Congress to follow your lead. Your executive order is a first step, but House Speaker Ryan and Senate Majority Leader McConnell must follow through with a quick repeal and replacement plan that puts #PatientsFirst and allows medicine to return to its roots — doctors and patients working together to improve health outcomes and ensure long and happy lives.                
                

            
                The United States has the finest health care professionals in the world. We need to make sure that doctors are free to practice medicine and that patients — no matter who they are, where they live and what their economic status is — have access to care now.                
                

            
                Remember … patients and physicians like me are counting on you and your administration to save health care.                
                

            
                Sincerely,

A second chance to get America's health care right: Give authority to our states,"Health care reform has dominated our nation’s political and social conversations for the past six years. After the implementation of ObamaCare, it is clear the law brought radical change and real pain to our nation’s families, economy, and health care system. The promised ""affordable health care fix"" made things worse.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The pending King v. Burwell case reveals another interesting legal problem with the policy and text of the Affordable Care Act. As written, the federally controlled subsidies and employer mandates are not allowed, unless a state chooses them. Now the Supreme Court debates, behind closed doors, the question of state responsibility and textual intent to determine the direction of health care in America. The resulting Supreme Court opinion could dismantle the structure of ObamaCare and give America a second chance to get health care reform right.                  
                

            
                Ironically, the issue of state responsibility could take ObamaCare down and lift individual citizens up.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            States are generally more effective regulators than the federal government. Allowing states to assume responsibility and maintain authority moves people from numbers on a spreadsheet to neighbors down the street. 
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                The Constitution gives states the power to regulate health care within their state and voluntarily compact with other states, but the federal government has attempted to preempt state action by assuming centralized control. What is needed is clear legislation that affirms the right of states to compact with one another to return authority for health care regulation to states that choose to participate.                
                

            
                Interstate compacts have been used on more than 200 occasions to establish agreements between and among states. Mentioned in Article 1, Section 10 of the Constitution, state compacts provide authority and flexibility to administer government programs without federal interference. In the Compact structure, federal health care tax money and responsibility is returned to a state when they expand their existing Healthcare Authority structure.  Congressional consent is extended when states enter into a legally binding compact. It is similar to a multitude of other grants made by the federal government to states and local entities.                
                

            
                Complexity empowers big government, simplicity empowers families and local leaders.  Giving health care authority to states is simple and beneficial because they are able to enact accountability, efficiencies and tailor their system to fit the exact needs of their population. One size does not fit all – ObamaCare proves that. The health challenges and population needs of Vermont or California are not the same as Texas or Oklahoma.                  
                

            
                Why should bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. manage all health care systems the same way?                
                

            
                Health care is large, complex, and challenging to manage at the federal level. With a federal system that impacts over 300 million people, $2.3 trillion spent annually and almost 3,000 pages of regulations for Medicare and Medicaid, federal management of our health care system is inefficient and virtually occluded from individualized input. The Medicare fraud rate has hovered around 10 percent for decades, with over $50 billion in annual lost tax money.  Big systems allow massive financial loss and make individual citizens small.                  
                

            
                States are generally more effective regulators than the federal government. Allowing states to assume responsibility and maintain authority moves people from numbers on a spreadsheet to neighbors down the street. Rural health care struggles to get the attention of federal agencies, but they would have the consistent ear of state agencies.                 
                

            
                Some people assume only people in Washington, D.C. care about the health needs of people across the nation, but we can assure you that state leaders and state agencies deeply care for their neighbors and want to find ways to help them. In fact, before the Affordable Care Act passed, our states had already initiated systems to care for those without health care. Unfortunately, the state solutions were forced out when ObamaCare took over.                
                

            
                The Compact is an option that ensures the people of each state will have a choice. States can opt in to the Compact – or not.  To date, the Health Care Compact has been formally requested by 9 states – Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah – and several other states are considering it.                  
                

            
                As Congress works towards solutions to the problems created by the top-down approach of ObamaCare, we want to let states innovate to serve their citizens’ health care needs.  When the Supreme Court rules on King v. Burwell in favor of state responsibility, we want to let states innovate ways to serve their citizens’ health care.

JUAN WILLIAMS: Will Herman Cain Be the Big Story of the 2012 Election?,"Raise your hand if you think Herman Cain won Fox News Channel’s debate last week among contenders for the GOP’s 2012 presidential nomination?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Frank Luntz, the bestselling author and GOP pollster, held an instant focus group after the debate which overwhelmingly declared the Cain the winner. ""In all the years I have been doing this, I have never seen a reaction like this to a debate.” Luntz exclaimed. “Something very special happened here tonight.”                
                

            
                Traffic and contributions to Cain’s website have increased sharply in the days since the debate. The conservative media, particularly the blogosphere, were praising the 65-year-old talk radio host from Georgia all weekend. On Friday, the date after the debate, he won a presidential straw poll at a Washington state GOP convention and drew a crowd of several hundred people in Las Vegas.                
                

            
                As one of the moderators for that debate, I am very surprised at the rave reviews for Cain – both in the media and in Greenville that night.                
                

            
                I first realized that Cain was the winner when my colleague Shannon Bream and I were discussing on stage the question of which candidate did best at the debate. She said her dad texted her at the end of the debate – while she was still on stage -- to tell her that Herman Cain won. That prompted me to conduct my own informal, post-debate survey of people in the auditorium and back at the hotel. When I asked them who won the debate, almost every one responded ‘Herman Cain.’                
                

            
                Herman Cain? When he was asked about what to do in Afghanistan he had no answer other than to set a priority, get good people around him to study the problem and act decisively. That was his answer to almost every tough question and to my mind it amounted to a non-answer.                
                

            
                But obviously I am missing something.                
                

            
                I have always been impressed by Cain as a man with a wonderful personal story of cancer survival and a black man who made his way in American business despite high levels of racial bias when he was in the middle of his career in the 1980s.                 
                

            
                He is best known as the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza where he is credited with saving the pizza chain from bankruptcy in the 1990s and making it profitable. Cain has extensive experience in the corporate world and even served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City.                
                

            
                He has recently mastered the one-liners and fiery talk of conservative talk radio but Cain also holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and a master’s degree in computer science.                
                

            
                Cain made his debut on the national political stage back in 1994 when he challenged President Clinton on his health care reform package during a televised town hall. The video of the exchange is readily available on YouTube. Cain claimed that Clinton’s health care proposal would cause businesses like his to fire their employees go in order to offset the cost of an insurance mandate for employers.                
                

            
                When Clinton defended his proposal, Cain confidentially responded ""Quite honestly, your calculation is inaccurate…In the competitive marketplace it simply doesn't work that way.” His schooling of the president made him a conservative celebrity.                
                

            
                While he has charisma and an impressive business resume, he has never held elected office before. When my pal, Chris Wallace, asked him about that at the debate, he had one of the evening’s most memorable answers:                
                

            
                “I’m proud of the fact that I haven’t held public office before. Most of the people that are in elected office in Washington DC, they have held public office before. How’s that workin’ for you? We have a mess. How about sending a problem-solver to the White House?”                
                

            
                Maybe I was too close to last week’s Republican presidential primary debate to offer an objective assessment. His one-liners were good but I did not feel that he demonstrated any facility with discussion of serious topics like foreign affairs.                
                

            
                Dave Funk, a prominent Republican Party official in Iowa, was quoted in a Wall Street Journal profile of Cain expressing a similar impression. ""Herman is a great speaker and makes a great first impression,"" he noted. ""But what I don't see yet is a great deal of depth on things like Afghanistan and national defense.""                
                

            
                But among conservative activists and Tea Party groups across the nation, the people who know him best, Cain is known and respected for his thinking as much for his fiery, impassioned speeches at rallies and conferences. So it is a mistake to underestimate Cain. He could be the story of this election cycle.                
                

            
                It is still a long way to the nomination. But Herman Cain is now a player. And this year’s GOP nomination is still being baked. The question now is will the former pizza mogul be able to deliver?

Terminating American gridlock,"The pressing issues of excess debt, high unemployment and anemic economic growth have generated pessimism throughout the Western World, dividing both our governmental leaders and the public at large into warring political camps.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Right- and left-wing ideologues – in America are talking past each other in a continual “Dialogue of the Deaf.” They have insulted our intelligence and created stifling policy gridlock in Washington.                
                

            
                Fortunately, all is not yet lost. In my new book, ""American Gridlock – Why the Left and Right are Both Wrong,"" I demonstrate how we can end this pointless dialogue and, at the same time, escape the current gridlock via new policies that work.                
                

            
                Specifically, I identify five key challenges the nation now faces and derive win-win strategies for meeting each — strategies that transcend the traditional left/right divide and render it irrelevant. These challenges are:                
                

            
                1) Avoiding a “lost decade” marked by permanently high unemployment;
2) Averting eventual national bankruptcy due to exploding health-care costs.
3) Preventing future “perfect financial storms” like the one that triggered the global depression in 2008.
4) Standing up to “thugocracies” that use currency manipulation and unfair trade policies to take advantage of us.
5) Confronting the increasingly heated debate over “fair shares” of wealth and income – or “Distributive Justice,” as the philosophers call it.                
                

            
                Without doubt, these are difficult issues – but it is possible to derive solutions to each, solutions that transcend stale left/right ideologies.                 
                

            
                The key is to apply deductive logic in identifying wholly new policy solutions – solutions based on new and unfamiliar types of logic such as game theory and the economics of uncertainty.                 
                

            
                This method stands in stark contrast to today’s more common approach, based on bastardized inductive logic in which data are cherry-picked to support pre-existing policy prejudices.

As an example, my analysis deduced that there is only one strategy that will prevent this decade from becoming a “lost” one defined by stagnation and high unemployment. This is to adopt a new Marshall Plan, investing in a variety of large-scale infrastructure projects – not mere “pothole filling” as is currently the fashion.                 
                

            
                The catch is that these projects must be fiscally worthwhile, being funded only if independent experts certify they will earn a positive return on capital invested.                
                

            
                This stipulation guarantees that these projects will more than return the funds borrowed to finance them. Any short-term deficits they give rise to are thus “good deficits.”                 
                

            
                Today’s heated debates over deficits consistently ignore this distinction between good and bad deficits. The former result from borrowing for productive investments that will pay for themselves rather than burdening our children with future debt. Bad deficits of the kind we have accumulated in recent years do not pay for themselves.                
                

            
                Another policy challenge lies in constraining mushrooming health care expenditures. Medical costs currently account for 18.3% of GDP and are projected to soar to 35% or more by mid-century.                 
                

            
                Happily, this crisis can also be averted by adopting a single over-arching policy that satisfies the following three goals of health care reform:                
                

            
                1) Greatly expanded access to health care (in accord with ObamaCare);
2) Major increases in the supply of health care services (not in accord with supply-lite ObamaCare). 
3) A significant and ongoing reduction in total health-care expenditure as a share of GDP over time (a goal never previously proposed as it would seem too much to hope for given the first two goals).                
                

            
                The policy required to satisfy all three goals is to shift outward the supply curve for health care services faster than the demand curve shifts outward – a process I detail in my book, proving its validity. In short, I show exactly how we can have our cake and eat it too on this all-important issue.                
                

            
                With respect to preventing future “perfect financial storms” from ravaging global economies, as happened during 2007-2009, there’s only one “control variable” that can be successfully manipulated: the degree of leverage permitted in the financial system.                 
                

            
                Drawing on a powerful new theory of market risk assessment developed at Stanford University, I demonstrate that the damage wreaked by “perfect storms” increases exponentially with greater leverage. Leverage must thus be cut much more than is proposed in current reform proposals.                
                

            
                The fourth challenge lies in more successfully confronting nations, such as China, that repeatedly take advantage of us in negotiations, especially over trade.                 
                

            
                This is a many-faceted issue, but one I believe can be resolved in favor of the U.S. through the use of important new bargaining techniques derived from the theories of John F. Nash Jr., whose story was told in the film ""A Beautiful Mind.""                
                

            
                The fifth challenge is to confront two issues raised by the “Occupy” movements that have sprouted across the globe:                
                

            
                1) The true status of “capitalism,” a creed increasingly under attack. What passes for capitalism today is far different from what Adam Smith and early academic economists meant by the term.                 
                

            
                In the book, I clarify these differences, showing how true capitalism can generate faster economic growth and higher living standards than any other possible system. Thus in reining in abuses in real-world capitalism, we must not throw the baby out with the bath water.                
                

            
                2) The concept of a “fair” distribution of wealth – a major dividing point between the left and the right. There are two fundamental norms of fair distribution – “To Each According to His Contribution,” and “To Each According to His Need” – with the capitalist right claiming contribution has primacy and the left traditionally arguing neediness has priority.                 
                

            
                At the end of the book, I sketch out a plan for achieving a new theory of justice that incorporates – and, indeed, integrates – the two concepts of relative need and relative contribution.                
                

            
                Only by applying rigorous deductive logic to these five different policy arenas can we transcend today’s Left/Right divide – and, in so doing, offer hope that American gridlock can indeed be broken.

"Yes, there is a Republican war on women voters","While it’s true that President Obama’s re-election campaign is gearing up a major push this week to win over female voters, the fact is that Republicans have been helping him out on this front for weeks.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                From the GOP primary to the conservative airwaves, in state legislatures and in Congress, Republicans are playing politics with women’s health and basic liberties, driving a wedge among conservatives and driving women voters toward the Democrats.                 
                

            
                It all started with Eve. Adam, whom I suspect was a Republican, was angry that after Eve got his rib, she wanted to vote and get a job and be fairly paid. That ungrateful woman! Adam argued back and then Eve registered as an independent, and eventually became a swing vote soccer mom. But anyway…                 
                

            
                Fast-forward to February 2011 when anti-choice Republicans pushed a rogue measure to cut off all federal funding from Planned Parenthood, even though less than 3% of services provided by Planned Parenthood are abortions, none of which are paid for using federal grant dollars.                 
                

            
                Still, Republicans saw an opportunity to fire up their fringe base while undermining a liberal-leaning advocacy organization. And if the five million American women who get affordable health care from Planned Parenthood every year had to be thrown under the bus, so be it. All’s fair in politics.                 
                

            
                Almost a year later, a Republican operative at the Susan G. Komen breast cancer foundation pushed for the organization to cut its support of Planned Parenthood. Uproar from women was swift and strong, prompting Komen to reverse the decision and fire the ideologically-driven instigator.                 
                

            
                But Republicans kept pushing their anti-choice, anti-women’s health agenda.                 
                

            
                Presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who has repeatedly reiterated his staunch opposition to contraception, began surging in the polls among conservative voters.                 
                

            
                Republicans in Virginia proposed a law that would require women seeking abortions, even those resulting from rape or incest, to first submit to mandatory trans-vaginal ultrasounds -- a further invasion of their bodies.                 
                

            
                And Republicans in Texas pushed through a law defunding Planned Parenthood clinics in the state, cutting off at least 60,000 low-income women from their health care providers.                 
                

            
                Thursday, the New York Times reports, ""Senate Democratic women plan to march to the Senate floor to demand quick action on the extension of the Violence Against Women Act."" The Times goes on to say that the act, ""once [a piece of ] broadly bipartisan legislation...now faces fierce opposition from conservatives."" The article also mentions this point from a female, Republican Senator: ""At a closed-door Senate Republican lunch on Tuesday, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska sternly warned her colleagues that the party was at risk of being successfully painted as anti-woman — with potentially grievous political consequences in the fall.""                
                

            
                Which is all to say that when President Obama’s Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius issued preliminary statements on how the contraception mandate would be applied to religiously-based institutions like hospitals and universities with a primarily public purpose, the Republican Party pounced on the situation with the hopes of exploiting it for political gain.                 
                

            
                Never mind that 28 states had already instituted similar regulations with no fanfare or uproar from religious conservatives. This was different.                 
                

            
                Republican strategists saw this as a slam dunk opportunity to criticize health care reform and paint President Obama as opposing religious liberty. If basic contraception access for women was the casualty, who cares? In fact, for some Republican politicians, like Rick Santorum, that was an added bonus!                 
                

            
                Whether or not you think this amounts to a Republican “war on women,” it’s definitely a “war on women voters.”                 
                

            
                Consider Mary Russell, a retired teacher from Iowa City, Iowa, who describes herself as an evangelical Christian and “old school” Republican of the moderate mold. Regarding the Republican presidential candidates, Ms. Russell says, “If they’re going to decide on women’s reproductive issues, I’m not going to vote for any of them. Women’s reproduction is our own business.” Now she reports she may vote for President Obama.                 
                

            
                In a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll while in an imagined face-to-face match up, President Obama currently trails Mitt Romney by six percentage points with male voters,but the president has an 18 point lead with women --- across political parties.                 
                

            
                It’s no wonder. As divisive as abortion rights still are as a political issue, women voters (and most men) are overwhelmingly supportive of basic contraception. That's no surprise considering that 99% of reproductive-age women have used birth control.                 
                

            
                While women voters might rather focus on jobs and the economy, watching Republicans jeopardize women’s health and reproductive freedom while slandering those who try and stand in their way is enough to make women demand not only good jobs and fair pay but political leaders who respect the liberty and rights of women in America.                 
                

            
                President Obama’s campaign may be paying for fliers and advertisements to attract women voters, but in this regard, Republicans are giving him the kind of help that money can’t buy.

Jose Calderon: Now We Need to Advance a Pro-Latino Agenda in Washington,"LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 05:  Voters go to the polls for Super Tuesday primaries in the predominantly Latino neighborhood of Boyle Heights on February 5, 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Latinos are an increasingly important factor in California where they are expected to account for 14 percent of the vote and tend to favor presidential hopeful Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) over rival Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL). At 44 million, Latinos make up15 percent of the US population, the nation's largest minority group according to the latest Census Bureau estimates.

                Election Day was a historic show of strength for the Latino community. As a friend of mine said, ""we got on the electoral bus and took a front seat.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Indeed, across the United States, Latinos made their way to the polls in droves on Election Day and made history. A record of roughly 12 million Latinos turned out to vote on Tuesday and for the first time made up 10 percent of the electorate.                
                

            
                Latino voters made the difference in deciding the Presidential Election with nearly three-quarters voting to reelect President Obama and were specifically key to the outcome in several swing states including Florida, Virginia, Colorado and Nevada. We also helped elect a record 31 Latinos to Congress and 276 state legislators across 36 states.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Our leaders must find a path to preserve and expand these essential programs that voters clearly stood up for
					
		   				- Jose Calderon
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                None of this would have been possible without Latino and community-led voter registration and mobilization efforts in many states in 2012. For instance, the organization I represent, the Hispanic Federation, made well over 100,000 calls and door knocks to get our community out to vote in this historic election. Many of our sister organizations have similar stories of voter impact that they can share. According to a pre-election ImpreMedia-Latino Decisions Poll, as many as 1 in 7 Latinos nationwide were contacted by a community organization in recent months to register or vote. That is almost on par with the major political party efforts targeting Latino voters.                
                

            
                So what does this mean for Latinos moving forward? Clearly there is much work to be done to advance a pro-Latino agenda in Washington and states across the country. For starters, as Washington debates the approaching ""fiscal cliff"", it is vital that voters hold the line on drastic cuts to education and social service programs that are intended to lift up our people and improve our economy. Our leaders must find a path to preserve and expand these essential programs that voters clearly stood up for.

                On health care, the voters - and the Supreme Court - have spoken and the debate is over on whether the President's Affordable Care Act is the right direction for this country. It's time for states to implement health care reform.                
                

            
                On the economy, too many of our neighbors and family members need a better paying job. It's beyond time for Congress to work with the President to invest in our workforce in the form of infrastructure repairs, green jobs and workforce development training. After Hurricane Sandy, it is also clear we need to invest in our transportation and power systems to better prepare for our changing climate.                
                

            
                On education, our communities are plagued with failing public schools. Our federal and state governments need to get serious about nation-building here at home by investing in a well-educated citizenry through a focus on smaller class sizes, college readiness, parental empowerment and a stronger, larger, more bilingual teacher core. We must also stand strong against proposed cuts to college Pell Grants that provide a path to the middle class for so many Latinos.                
                

            
                And we have waited far too long for just and humane national immigration reform. The President's Deferred Action for Youth Arrivals (DACA) Initiative, while important, is only a start and a temporary one at that. Congress must pass the DREAM Act and a broad legalization bill. And Congress needs to rethink the future of immigration when it comes to reuniting families and recruiting needed workers.                
                

            
                As resounding as our mobilization was on Election Day, our work is far from done. Each of us must engage in pushing our government officials to deliver these needed reforms and investments. Now it's time to make the calls and travel to our capitol to demand what we know is right and long overdue. In other words, now we must steer that 'electoral bus' to a destination that addresses our policy needs and aspirations.

              Democrats are desperate to derail long-overdue tax relief that is heading to the Senate floor for a vote this week – even if by doing so they take money from the pockets of their own constituents.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              There are no good arguments against allowing hardworking Americans to keep more of their money. But that hasn’t stopped Democrats, who are intent on denying President Trump a victory at any cost – including lying about the Senate tax bill’s impact in an attempt to block its passage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This deceit was on full display at a CNN Town Hall debate this week, where career politicians Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Maria Cantwell of Washington state leaned on shopworn Democratic talking points as the basis for the their opposition to the tax bill. These include the following five myths that have been making the rounds among Democrats and their media allies. 
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 1: The tax bill is a tax increase on the middle class.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Cantwell: “Raising taxes on the middle class is wrong, and that’s what this bill does.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Recognizing the popularity of a middle-class tax cut, Democrats are trying to use the Bizarro-world argument that the tax cut bill is actually a tax increase. They cite a Tax Policy Center report claiming the bill would raise taxes on 87 million middle-class families.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              What the Democrats don’t mention is that the Tax Policy Center is a project of the left-wing Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, funded by donors like George Soros who want to disrupt President Trump’s agenda by any means necessary.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Tax Policy Center can only arrive at this eyebrow-raising conclusion by making the unrealistic assumption that the tax cuts would expire after 10 years.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In reality, the tax bill would provide significant relief for the middle class by doing the following: doubling the income threshold under which families pay no taxes at all to $24,000; doubling the child tax credit to $2,000; and eliminating the 15 percent tax rate in favor of an expanded 12 percent rate, among other provisions.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The above changes would save ordinary families thousands of dollars a year. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 2: The majority of the tax bill’s benefits go to the top 1 percent of earners.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Sanders: “60 percent of the tax benefits in the Republican plan would go to the top 1 percent.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats are trying to distract from the bill’s middle-class tax relief by claiming most of the benefits go to the super-rich. But in reality, the bill is targeted at the middle class.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In addition to the middle-class provisions mentioned above, consider the bill’s relief for Main Street small businesses. The bill offers a 20 percent small business tax deduction for all small businesses earning less than $500,000 a year. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This 20 percent tax deduction would allow small business owners to keep more of their earnings, helping them to compete with their big business and international competitors – as well as hire more employees, raise wages and expand.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to the Tax Foundation, 97 percent of small businesses earn less than this $500,000 threshold, meaning the overwhelming majority of small businesses would see relief from this provision.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But who would see little-to-no relief from it? The top 1 percent, with annual incomes of roughly $500,000 and higher.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Given this clear middle-class relief, how do Democrats back up their 1 percent claim? By pointing to the tax bill’s provision to bring the corporate tax rate in line with international standards.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              However, survey and economic evidence demonstrates that corporate tax cuts benefit the middle class in the form of higher wages, better workplace benefits, new job opportunities and lower consumer prices.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Even higher dividend payouts benefit the middle class, because the majority of corporate stock is owned by retirement plans, including IRAs, 401ks and government pension plans that help ordinary Americans save.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 3: The tax bill will grow deficit by $1.4 trillion.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Sanders: “This legislation will grow the deficit by $1.4 trillion. Mark my words.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats are suddenly pretending to care about the nation’s fiscal state by pointing to the tax bill’s $1.4 trillion of lost revenues on a static basis over 10 years. What isn’t said is that this is only a 3 percent drop from the $43 trillion Congressional Budget Office (CBO) revenue projection over this timeframe.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But in the real world – outside of simplistic Excel spreadsheets – people respond to incentives. With more money in their pockets and in their communities, consumers, businesses and investors will spend more, creating economic growth that will more than pay for the $1.4 trillion in lost revenues.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to the CBO, every 0.1 percent increase in the gross domestic product adds over $250 billion in revenue over 10 years. This means that even returning to 2.5 percent economic growth – still well below the U.S. historical average – would more than pay for the tax cut.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 4: The tax bill won’t create economic growth.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Cantwell: “No, I don’t think (the tax bill) will grow (the economy).”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Given the dynamic effects on tax revenue from even minor economic growth, Democrats are at pains to deny the growth created by tax cuts. They cite left-wing economists to make their case – but historical evidence and commonsense undermine it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
               The tax cuts enacted under Presidents Coolidge, Kennedy and Reagan, among others, all generated several years of supercharged economic growth. The principle is simple: More money in the wealth-creating hands of the private economy – and less in the wealth-destroying hands of government – creates economic growth.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Some 100 economists wrote an open letter to Congress with the following message: “Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              MYTH 5: The tax bill will cause 13 million people to lose health insurance.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Sanders: “This bill… will result in 13 million people losing their health insurance.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Given this scare tactic worked so well to kill health-care reform, Democrats are trotting it out in an attempt to do the same to tax reform. But the facts are very different this time around.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Far from kicking people off health insurance as Democrats imply, the tax bill would simply eliminate the health-care tax on those who choose not to purchase health insurance. This tax is borne mostly by working- and middle-class Americans: Nearly 80 percent earn $50,000 a year or less. In fact, this provision would reduce the middle-class tax burden even further.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The tax-cut bill currently before the Senate offers ordinary Americans the best opportunity for tax relief in a generation. But Democrats are putting their narrow political interests ahead of what’s good for the country and lying to try to sink it.

Newt Gingrich: American greatness starts with tax reform,"(Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Repealing and replacing ObamaCare and implementing President Trump’s plan to build $1 trillion-worth of infrastructure are massively important for the president’s bold vision to make America great again, but the key to President Trump's success is tax reform.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Many congressional Republicans are eager to solve the ObamaCare crisis and have gone forward with what they can do under reconciliation to stop the bleeding.                
                

            
                President Trump acknowledged this to congressional leaders in a meeting yesterday.                
                

            
                But tax reform – as well as an infrastructure plan – will be the foundation for giving Republicans the momentum and moral authority to move ahead and fully reform the nation’s health care system.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            A stronger, more business-friendly economy will help ease tensions for both health care reform and infrastructure construction. Democrats will have a harder time opposing a Republican president who is overseeing a boost in job creation and economic growth during the long-term health care debate. 
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                The Republican repeal effort to reform health care will likely result in a bitter partisan fight. Probably no Democrat will vote to repeal ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Once the initial repeal is achieved by a purely partisan vote, we will need to rebuild ties with moderate Democrats to get things done.                
                

            
                We will need positive reforms in other areas that will bring some Democrats into a bipartisan coalition.                
                

            
                Momentum is exactly what Republicans need to fully liberate this country from the entitlement state system that has dominated American government for a half-century. It is critical that Republicans are strategic about fixing the health care system and that it be surrounded by other issues.                
                

            
                After the president’s address to the Joint Session of Congress last week, I predicted his massive infrastructure plan will win over about a third of the Democrats. However, it will face scrutiny from Republicans concerned about finding ways to pay for it – even though I’m confident President Trump will negotiate a much lower price tag, develop public private partnerships, and reduce costs by eliminating reams of burdensome rules from the Code of Federal Regulations.                
                

            
                A stronger, more business-friendly economy will help ease tensions for both health care reform and infrastructure construction. Democrats will have a harder time opposing a Republican president who is overseeing a boost in job creation and economic growth during the long-term health care debate. And increased revenues from business growth will make a large infrastructure plan easier for budget-conscious Republicans to accept – especially when a stronger economy is leading the nation toward a balanced budget.                
                

            
                The first major step Congress should take is to reform the tax system so companies are incentivized to invest and build factories in the United States and create good-paying jobs.                
                

            
                Speaker Paul Ryan has a plan that will do these things through a border adjustment tax, which is the right first step toward tax reform.                
                

            
                I recently spoke with a group of about 30 major American investors, and they expressed tremendous support for a border adjustment tax. Under our current tax system, it makes more sense for companies to move manufacturing jobs out of the United States, produce products in lower-wage countries, and then export their goods back to the U.S., because we do not impose corporate tax on imports.                
                

            
                Think about that. Our current tax system is essentially designed to drive production out of the United States. Companies who remain in the U.S. pay the highest business tax in the world and pay American workers American-level wages. Meanwhile, they are competing with companies who are paying foreign workers incredibly low wages – and paying no corporate taxes.                
                

            
                With a border adjustment tax, we would tax imports – just like more than 160 other countries that have either a value-added tax on imports, a border adjustment tax, or both.                 
                

            
                Right now, the United States is in the extreme minority of countries without a border adjustment tax – along with North Korea and South Sudan.                
                

            
                Reducing taxes on businesses and individuals, and reducing regulations, will cause more companies to invest in America again. The Tax Foundation reports that Speaker Ryan’s plan will create about 1.7 million jobs in America, and increase Gross Domestic Product by more than 9 percent.                
                

            
                Tax reform will provide the boost in jobs and production President Trump and Republicans in Congress need to build legislative momentum and implement the president’s infrastructure plan. Republicans will then be able to move from a clear position of strength as they deliberately and methodically rebuild our health care system.

              Just to be clear: if an emissary of Borut Pahor, President of Slovenia, had emailed Hillary campaign apparatchik John Podesta last summer, offering scandalous dirt on Melania Trump, he would have turned down the meeting? Give me a break.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Politics is a dirty game, and the Clinton campaign engaged in numerous underhanded tricks to defeat not only Bernie Sanders, but also rival Donald Trump. Weeks before the election, videos surfaced showing Clinton campaign workers strategizing on how to infiltrate and disrupt Trump rallies. As the New York Times headline put it: “Videos Put Democrats on Defensive About Dirty Tricks.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              What Donald Trump Jr. did in accepting a meeting with someone supposedly linked to the Russian government was dirty, and stupid, but it is not evidence that his father’s campaign “colluded” with Russia to defeat Hillary Clinton. It is evidence, instead, that many involved with the election of Donald Trump were political neophytes, and that the campaign was operating on a shoestring. In a normal campaign, lawyers might have been contacted, red flags would have been issued, and underlings would have taken the meeting. That didn’t happen, in part because there was almost no infrastructure to the Trump campaign.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              That said, having a Russia-linked source offer up “dirt” on Hillary Clinton would have been irresistible. Let us remember what was going on at the time. Russia was indeed a big story during the 2016 election, thanks to Peter Schweizer’s book ""Clinton Cash."" In it, the prize-winning author detailed any number of scandalous situations in which Hillary and Bill Clinton appear to have done favors for political or business allies in exchange for substantial gifts to the Clinton Foundation. Spurred by that best-seller, The Wall Street Journal and others conducted their own investigations into the foundation. The Journal reckoned “…that at least 60 companies that lobbied the State Department during [Clinton’s] tenure donated a total of more than $26 million to the Clinton Foundation.”
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Outrage over the Clinton Foundation and about Hillary’s evident “pay to play” proclivities was political fodder for Republicans throughout last year, and rightly so. Money actually changed hands between Russian entities and the Clintons, and favors were done. 
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              Among the most shocking of Schweizer’s charges was that Hillary helped win approval for Russia’s state nuclear agency (in other words, a government entity – directed by President Vladimir Putin) to buy a controlling interest in Uranium One, one of America’s largest uranium mines, in exchange for $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. The payments were not made public on the Clinton Foundation website, as was required by an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama administration. Instead, the funds flowed through a Canadian offshoot, the Clinton Giustra Sustainable Growth Initiative, and therefore escaped notice.  (Donations to the Canadian affiliate were included in the White House pact, but ignored by Clinton.)
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Mrs. Clinton also “forgot” to mention the donations to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              At roughly the same time, a Russian investment bank staffed with numerous ex-KGB types paid Bill Clinton a $500,000 speaking fee, causing a New Yorker writer to ask, “Why was Bill Clinton taking any money from a bank linked to the Kremlin while his wife was secretary of state?”  Does this resonate? Will Special Counsel Robert Mueller ask the same question? He certainly should.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The uranium deal was important, in that it concerned a large stock of a U.S. strategic asset. Also, the Kremlin had made expanding its access to uranium globally a high priority because it was hard at work building nuclear power plants such as the Bushehr facilities in Iran and similar projects in North Korea and Venezuela. In other words, the Uranium One purchase significantly boosted Russia’s business and diplomatic prospects. As a result, the deal raised national security concerns; numerous Congressmen had petitioned to block the purchase, which nonetheless took place.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Outrage over the Clinton Foundation and about Hillary’s evident “pay to play” proclivities was political fodder for Republicans throughout last year, and rightly so. Money actually changed hands between Russian entities and the Clintons, and favors were done. In that context, Donald Trump Jr. was approached by a Russian source who promised incriminating evidence about Hillary. Who wouldn’t jump at the chance?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              There are important challenges facing our country. You wouldn’t know it from following the mainstream media, caught up as they are in faux scandals and the ever-lasting “Russia” story. Democrats and their allies in the press cannot and will not move on from the investigations into Trump’s presumed ties to the Kremlin, even if it hurts the country. To do so would legitimatize the Trump presidency, and focus voters’ attentions on the popular White House agenda – health care reform, lower taxes, infrastructure spending, protected borders, a stronger military and a roll-back of decades of suffocating red tape. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats cannot afford that. They especially cannot afford to have Americans looking for their answers to our challenges – they don’t have any. Which is why Donald Trump, and not Hillary Clinton, is president.

ObamaCare and the 2012 Campaign,"There's no question that Thursday's ruling by the Supreme Court upholding the individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance starting in 2014 is a short term victory for President Obama. That's simply undeniable.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The court's decision to uphold the individual mandate and almost all of the health care law is a much better outcome for the Administration politically than invalidation of all -- or even part -- of the law. Indeed, it comes at the end of an especially bad month for Obama and stems the bloodletting that has been going on for most of June.                
                

            
                But there's a downside in today's news for the White House and the president's 2012 reelection campaign.                
                

            
                Put simply, in the court of public opinion, polling has consistently shown that ObamaCare is a loser. ObamaCare was unpopular in 2010, remains unpopular now, and almost certainly be unpopular come November.                
                

            
                A new Associated Press-GfK poll found that the Affordable Care Act remains unpopular across-the-board -- and particularly among independent swing voters. Indeed, Just a third of Americans overall -- and only 21 percent of independents approve of the law, a new low in AP-GfK polling.                
                

            
                And today's Supreme Court ruling --, which established in no uncertain terms that ObamaCare is a TAX -- will not make the law more popular in the long term.                
                

            
                Indeed, it will mean that the legislation will now be explicitly seen in the context of higher taxes for hardworking Americans at a time of weakened economic conditions.                
                

            
                This means that going forward in the election campaign, it will be increasingly difficult for President Obama to defend an unpopular law at an unpopular time -- thus working to Republican challenger Mitt Romney's advantage.                
                

            
                What the President needs to do is something that he has been reluctant to do -- take on the issue of entitlement policy in the context of overall fiscal and budgetary reform.                
                

            
                He must position ObamaCare as the centerpiece of an overarching plan to address the issue of costs in a serious and sustained way, while simultaneously  facilitating economic growth and private sector job creation.                
                

            
                Moreover, he must put forth a comprehensive set of policy prescriptions to address the issues that the American people regard as fundamental, and a long-term economic agenda that emphasizes tax reform, fiscal prudence, and economic growth -- as well as the need to rein in entitlements, balance the budget, and reduce the debt and deficit.                
                

            
                To that end, he can talk about ObamaCare in a manner that emphasizes cost containment and innovation, within the context of fiscal discipline and budgetary restraint -- specifically referencing the work of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform -- a bipartisan commission chaired by former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and former chief of staff in the Clinton White House, Erskine Bowles.                
                

            
                For his part, Mitt Romney will almost certainly say that his first act if elected President will be repealing ObamaCare, and continue to attack the higher taxes and the impact on health care costs that will surely result.                
                

            
                And in the short-term this makes sense.                
                

            
                But with Mitt Romney's own favorability  ratings remaining low and a new round of polling showing Obama holding a consistent advantage in key swing states -- it is a strategy with limited upsides.                
                

            
                Governor Romney, too, has to articulate a vision for comprehensive health care reform.                
                

            
                Put simply, in the absence of a clear set of core principles, and a plan to balance the budget, create jobs and a smart, reasonable, and rational discussion about health care and a health care policy that takes steps to rein in excesses in the system, his hopes for winning the White House come November -- a goal that is well within reach -- could be dashed."

                Is there any way Democrats can win the 17 seats they need to capture the House majority this November?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In one word: Yes.                
                

            
                Democrats picked up 8 seats two years ago despite widespread predictions of losses. They lost 12 seats in 2012 by less than five percentage points and another 18 seats by less than 10 percentage points.                
                

            
                Also keep in mind that every poll shows the public agrees with Democrats on the big issues – gay marriage, pay equity for women, immigration, gun control and budget cuts.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, the GOP brand remains unpopular. The biggest advantage for House Democrats is that they are running against Republicans. That party’s good name suffered from last fall’s government shutdown, a strategy of obstruction that has paralyzed the Congress, and the recent vote in support of a budget that privatizes Medicare.                
                

            
                Another plus for Democrats is that the GOP’s misguided message to voters for the fall elections – “ObamaCare is a Failure.” That claim is out of date with the success of 7 million people enrolling and 3 million more gaining insurance through Medicaid expansion. The ‘kill health care reform’ message, with endless GOP votes in the House for repeal, also irritates swing voters. Polling shows Independents want to fix ObamaCare, not kill it.                
                

            
                But even with all those advantages the odds remain against Democrats getting enough wins to make Nancy Pelosi the Speaker of the House. Top political analysts, from Charlie Cook to Larry Sabato, currently predict Republicans adding two or three seats to easily retain their majority.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                Even the chair of the Democratic Congressional Committee, New York’s Rep. Steve Israel, told the National Press Club in early April: “It’s a tough climate for us right now.”                
                

            
                In the 2012 House races, Democrats won 50.6 percent of America’s votes with a popular President Obama at the top of the ballot. Although they won the majority of votes they picked up only 8 seats, leaving them 17 shy of majority control. The Democrats’ voters are concentrated in blue states and even high turnout has minimal impact on Republican districts.                
                

            
                Another problem for Democrats this year is the absence of President Obama’s name on the ballot. His star power has a history of driving up voter turnout among core Democrats, young people, women and minorities. But his name is not on this year’s ballot. And after the bungling of the start of computer enrollment for health care the president’s support among Democrats slipped. It has slipped even more among Independent voters. That has caused the president’s popularity to drop into the mid-40 percent range. History is pretty clear here. Second-term incumbents almost always see their party lose seats, an average of 29.                
                

            
                Also bedeviling to Democrats are the results from polls asking voters if they prefer having Democrats or Republicans in charge of the House. Voters are about even, with Democrats holding only a slight, 41-39 percent edge, according to Real Clear Politics. That translates to political strategists as Democrats not having a strong political wind at their back as they sail into the election.                
                

            
                But let me offer the contrarian argument: There is still hope for Democrats to win the House majority!                
                

            
                First, the Democrats are lucky to be running against the House Republicans. Polls show the GOP has a measly 30 percent approval rating. House Republicans are even less popular with about an 18 percent approval rating, according to the most recent polls.                
                

            
                Democrats in the House have nearly twice the approval rating, at 30 percent in the same Quinnipiac poll.                
                

            
                Infighting between so-called ‘establishment Republicans’ and ‘Tea Party Republicans’ compounds the Republicans’ low favorability.  The party’s image is captive to incumbent Republican fears of not being sufficiently conservative to stave off a challenge from a Tea Party challenger in primary races. That’s why House Republicans just passed a budget with cuts to education and savings from making Medicare a private plan. Basically the House GOP, in their preoccupation with the far right, just handed Democrats a great weapon for beating up House Republicans in the fall races.                
                

            
                “The Republican budget [is going to] define the next seven months,” said DCCC chair Israel. “With this budget the Republicans are turning their back on the middle class.”                
                

            
                Another reason for the Democrats to have some optimism about House races is the retirement of several popular Republican incumbents and changing demographics. Here are two races that illustrate how holding the House majority may be more difficult for Republicans than the experts would have you believe.                
                

            
                When moderate Republican Jon Runyan, R-N.J., retired, he set off a chaotic fight between Tea Party and establishment Republicans in the district. The local Republican establishment candidate, Tom MacArthur, is battling for the nomination against Tea Party insurgent Steve Lonegan. Not only are they tearing each other up before the general election, but also both are vulnerable to charges of being carpetbaggers. Each man served as mayor of a New Jersey town outside the district. Aimee Belgard, a Democrat, is now positioned as an even pick to win a seat that previously looked safe for Republicans.                
                

            
                Then there is the demographic problem for Republicans. In Colorado’s 6th District, Republican Rep. Mike Coffman has seen a sharp increase among his Hispanic constituents. That rising tide led Coffman to back a bill to give legal status to children of illegal immigrants who are in school or join the military. But he is facing a formidable challenge from the former Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives, Andrew Romanoff, who is telling voters about the GOP’s refusal to act on immigration reform.                
                

            
                Those races explain why no one should be surprised if Democrats find a way to chalk up some House wins this fall.

                Last September, Nancy Pelosi warned Americans that a Republican Senate majority would mean that ""civilization as we know it would be in jeopardy."" We can only hope the Congresswoman is putting the finishing touches on her doomsday bunker, because it’s official -- the Republican Party holds the keys to the Senate for the first time since 2007.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The question now becomes, what are they going to do with them? A dual majority gives the Republican Party a tremendous opportunity to lead, but also a responsibility to regain America’s faith in the legislative process by passing good policy and functioning properly.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                But despite the long road of work that lies ahead, there are some things worth celebrating immediately:                 
                

            
                -  Harry Reid can no longer block fiscally responsible policy reforms from reaching the Senate floor.                 
                

            
                - Barack Obama can no longer legislate from the White House while the Senate sits idly by, rubber stamping his unilateral political agenda.                
                

            
                But after the confetti settles, it’s time for the GOP to get to work. Unfortunately, their hand-picked candidates failed to articulate their policy priorities from the campaign trail, and instead relied on a campaign platform that can be best summed up as “I’m not Barack Obama.”                 
                

            
                But “I’m not Barack Obama” is most certainly not the compelling legislative agenda that Republicans so desperately need.  And it’s no secret at this point that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are not the leaders who will lead Republicans towards a positive pro-reform platform with real policy solutions.                  
                

            
                The real policy solutions are going to come from the “Ideas Wing” of the GOP in the next House and Senate, the new generation of principled and energetic leadership that came in with the classes of ’10, ’12 and ’14.                
                

            
                Watch for newly-elected Ben Sasse to spearhead health care reform legislation that puts patients first and lowers costs. Senator Mike Lee will become a guiding think-tank for the GOP from his new leadership position on the Senate Steering Committee. Members of the Liberty Caucus like Justin Amash and Thomas Massie will continue to drive issues like Internet freedom and civil liberties in the House.                
                

            
                Republican leadership has the opportunity to put failed programs on the table for elimination, return to regular order, put these ideas on the president’s desk and force him to explain why he opposes good policy.                
                

            
                If a Republican-led House and Senate can work together to send real reforms to the White House, they will set the stage for a successful 2016 presidential battle. The American people will finally have a good idea of what the GOP stands for, and see who has really been creating gridlock in Washington when Obama sends them back.                
                

            
                Simply opposing the president without alternative policy solutions is not going to cut it anymore. If the GOP can unite around an inclusive liberty agenda in 2016 and engage -- rather than alienate -- their grassroots base, they’ll win big just like they should have in 2012.                
                

            
                I believe in the new generation of leadership in the GOP, and the growing coalition of small-l libertarians who will join them in the next Congress. Enjoy the victory, finish your drinks, but on Wednesday morning, it’s time to lead.

Obama Rolls Dice With Supreme Court,"President Obama is rolling the dice. By pushing the Supreme Court to decide on the legality of his controversial Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare), the president risks having his “legacy” legislation declared unconstitutional. That would be a sizeable body blow for Mr. Obama, who has long expected that voters would cheer on not only the health care overhaul, but also his reelection bid.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                At the least, the high court review will catapult ObamaCare into the 2012 campaign. Since the bill continues to poll poorly (Rasmussen recently found that 56% of registered voters favor repeal), arguing its merits anew cannot bolster the president’s prospects.                 
                

            
                Most important, the debate will remind voters that Mr. Obama spent a year and a half pushing health care “reform” instead of focusing on job creation.                 
                

            
                Also, the imminent imposition of the bill’s unpopular fees and mandates – which include a new Medicare payroll tax on investment income starting in 2012 and a whopping 40% levy on high-end insurance plans which will surely be passed onto consumers -- will loom large.                 
                

            
                The program’s estimated cost continues to soar while insurance fees are skyrocketing, as insurers offset the bill’s requirements that they cover dependent children and persons with “preexisting conditions.”                 
                

            
                In 2014 the outlook will worsen as the waivers granted to 1,472 businesses and unions expire, forcing them to provide expensive coverage or pay fees.                 
                

            
                In 2014, as well, Medicaid rolls will swell, driving up the costs of healthcare across the board. All in all, it is not a pretty picture, and it will not help the president. This was anticipated; the legislation was carefully crafted so that its darker aspects would emerge only after Mr. Obama’s presumed reelection.                
                

            
                Surely this is a decision made in desperation. A win at the Supreme Court could be touted as a victory; but what a hollow one it would be. Unless the economy surges ahead, shortening unemployment lines, the nation will not celebrate ObamaCare, viewed now as the Great Sidetrack.                 
                

            
                How could this politically canny administration have gone so wrong?                 
                

            
                Perhaps it was an acute case of grandiosity. Even before the inauguration balloons had fizzled, Obama’s supporters talked of his legacy. He seemed destined for great things – this young president who had already made history. Time magazine and The New Yorker both ran cover photos of Obama in FDR-pose, complete with iconic cigarette-holder. The American Spectator reported that the president’s staff encouraged writers to “find parallels to FDR and his first hundred days.”                 
                

            
                Sadly, the parallels exist.                 
                

            
                Like FDR, Mr. Obama used the financial crisis to push through the monstrous stimulus bill, to wage war on business leaders and to spread the wings of the federal government.                 
                

            
                ObamaCare is surely the worst manifestation of this power-grab. One lawyer arguing against ObamaCare before the court describes it as “a massive collection of sweeping changes that impose substantial new federal obligations on every corner of society and compel financial action from nearly every citizen of the United States.” That sounds about right.                
                

            
                Politically, and economically, ramming through ObamaCare was a colossal error. It ripped the barely-mended tears in our nation’s political and social fabric and created massive uncertainty among business owners and managers.                 
                

            
                Most important, Mr. Obama spent his political capital, of which each president has but a limited supply. What could he have accomplished instead?                 
                

            
                He might have actually shepherded through Congress the three trade agreements that Obama has repeatedly endorsed, and which without a doubt would have created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have proposed a public/private infrastructure works campaign that would have required only modest funding from the government and yet created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have worked with the business community, fast-tracking applications for new plant construction and providing investment tax credits that could offset the uncertainties posed by the foundering economy, and created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have embraced an all-out development of our energy resources – not investing in solar companies that go bankrupt -- but opening new territories to oil and gas drilling, and created jobs.                 
                

            
                He might have sponsored serious tax reform.                
                

            
                Paul Krugman denies that the administration’s insouciant meddling with industries – autos, banks, insurers, oil companies, drug producers, mining, aerospace, credit card outfits, homebuilders and so on – the list lengthens every week- has anything to do with the failed recovery. He is wrong.                 
                

            
                Krugman insists that the lack of investment from the business community is all about inadequate demand. How then to explain the $17.7 billion that U.S. firms invested in Ireland in the first half of this year? Those companies sought lower tax rates, a well educated English-speaking workforce and, according to the Financial Times, an “ease of doing business.” All three items increasingly hard to find in the United States.                
                

            
                Once viewed as the savviest apparatchiks on the planet, the president and his team now seem clueless, consistently misjudging the moment and the message.                 
                

            
                The president’s current “divide and conquer” political approach is grating and is sapping Mr. Obama’s personal appeal. His efforts to portray high-income Americans as the problem, as opposed to the solution, are foolish.                 
                

            
                Unhappily for the country, President Obama has indeed channeled FDR, whose policies subdued our economy for the better part of a decade. Let us hope voters today are smarter than those of the 1930s, and that they judge Mr. Obama on his accomplishments, not on his promises.

Why Santorum Appeals to Women and Evangelicals,"I don’t want to brag — well, maybe I do — but as I predicted, Iowans rallied their support around Senator Rick Santorum.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Coming in second to Mitt Romney by only eight votes, Sen. Santorum made a remarkable leap out of last place and into second in Iowa in little over a week.                 
                

            
                In a year of surges, Santorum seems to have timed his perfectly. But what’s behind this new support for someone who had to fight for air time during each and every debate?                
                

            
                The picture didn’t look good. Yes, Santorum recently became popular, but he was slapped as a “big spender” by Bachmann and Perry. And a Des Moines Register poll released just three days prior to the caucus showed that 41 percent of Iowans were undecided or could be persuaded to change their minds.                 
                

            
                What were they lacking? Confidence. It’s something we already lack under the current administration and thus a quality we crave from our next candidate.                
                

            
                In conservative circles, it’s common to hear embarrassed explanations for our various candidates of choice. Common statements include, “I know he’s boring and believes in nothing, but we have to connect with independents,” or “Yes, he says dumb stuff and has a woman problem, but we need a businessman.” And, frankly, people get sick of candidates speaking of themselves in the third person, forgetting their own plans, and comparing themselves to football players. It’s cringe-inducing.                
                

            
                After playing the field for weeks, women in Iowa finally settled down with their man. In fact, CNN entrance polls showed that the majority of women were supporting Santorum at twenty-seven percent (despite the sweater vest). It wasn’t a woman candidate this time, but I’m convinced that it will happen.                 
                

            
                Michele Bachmann was a serious candidate, a fierce competitor, and an excellent communicator. She made everyone in the race better, because she made them define their conservative credentials. This wasn’t her year, but mark my words, her day will come.                
                

            
                Santorum’s appeal to women and evangelicals centers on a desire for authenticity. Rick’s been consistent in behavior and record. His stance on the sanctity of life and traditional marriage gained the voters’ attention.                 
                

            
                His personal story of a strong marriage and eight children, including baby Gabriel, who died, and beautiful Bella, who is severely handicapped and the apple of her father’s eye is beyond reproach. His record in the U.S. Senate is one of unwavering support of conservative principles. His foreign policy acumen is equal to anyone on the debate stage.                
                

            
                He did finish well, but he didn’t finish first. As my father always joked, second place is the first loser. Mitt Romney was the winner last night.                 
                

            
                The man many are calling “most electable” came out on top in Iowa.                
                

            
                Many of my Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee (CWALAC) members respect Mitt’s savvy business skills, but they are having a hard time wrapping their minds around him as a whole package.                 
                

            
                They can’t ignore that it was the former Massachusetts governor who championed health care reform that cost the state $4.3 billion and 18,000 jobs. Nor can they ignore his past support for so-called “domestic partnerships” or the fact that after the Massachusetts Supreme Court’s paper tiger ruling on “gay marriage,” he ordered Justices of the Peace in the state to issue marriage licenses to homosexual couples or be fired.                
                

            
                With evangelical Christians being one of the largest voting blocs in America, “the Mormon thing” may be an issue, but I am not convinced this is what has held him back. However, some of my CWALAC ladies would love to understand the whole “eternal pregnancy in heaven thing,” which, admittedly, to me sounds more like damnation than heaven.                
                

            
                No one is perfect, but explaining the Santorum surge is easy when you see how every other candidate comes with more baggage than Louis Vuitton.                
                

            
                Newt Gingrich has, rightly, been forgiven for his previous marital failures, but can conservatives truly forget? Of the remaining candidates, however, I actually believe Newt has the best chance of resurgence.                
                

            
                Ron Paul’s “new isolationism” is scaring security moms, and he has made us all blanch over his views on the legalization of drugs and prostitution. What may ultimately be his downfall is his misplaced view of the 10th Amendment versus the federal government’s correct role in protecting individual liberty as exemplified by forced integration. While he did come in third, it seems like the only “President Paul” America will vote into office someday might be Rand, not Ron.                
                

            
                All Republican candidates would do well to remember who they’re trying to beat — ultimately an incumbent president — and maintain decorum on the campaign trail. After all, it was Ronald Reagan who maintained the 11th Commandment, “Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.”                
                

            
                Apparently, some media pundits have decided to go in another direction on the issue of civility. Most recently, Alan Colmes was forced to apologize for stating that in 1996 Santorum brought his dead baby boy home to “play with it.”                
                

            
                Colmes’ cold, heartless comment couldn’t be further from the truth. In fact, when a voter asked why the Santorum family made the decision to bring their deceased newborn home, Santorum’s wife Karen, broke down in tears, and Santorum courageously responded that he made the (no doubt) difficult decision because it was important that his six other children understand that they had a brother, and allow Rick and his wife a brief time of emotional healing.                
                

            
                Hopefully, Colmes now realizes that parents’ recovery after the loss of a child isn’t for him to judge. I plan to “have a word with him” on this point the next time I see him in the Fox News green room.                
                

            
                I predicted last night’s results, which truly surprised some of the mainstream media, because I had confidence in the people of Iowa.                
                

            
                I also have great confidence in our democratic process. Only eight people decided the winner and loser in Iowa. Isn’t that awesome?                
                

            
                Let us all remember that every vote counts and that regardless of which candidate we each choose, we do have a responsibility to choose. Alexis de Tocqueville said, “In democracy we get the government we deserve.” Let us pray we deserve better leadership than we have had these past three years. May God bless America.

              Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Resurgent.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Mitch McConnell, in public, says he wants to pass a health care reform plan that repeals ObamaCare. Remember, McConnell says he wants to scrap ObamaCare “root and branch.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But behind the scenes, McConnell has been working over liberal senators to assure them his plan will not actually scrap the Medicaid expansion and that he will undermine Senator Ted Cruz’s amendment to provide individual freedom in health care choices.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              McConnell, again and again, stacks the deck against conservatives, setting them up to be the fall guy for his own failures.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The president’s various nominees are on the slow walk through McConnell’s Senate, where the filibuster no longer applies.

              ObamaCare repeal is just about dead, even though it cannot be filibustered either.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              Tax reform is dead on arrival.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The entirety of the GOP agenda is stuck in the Senate where Mitch McConnell seems intent to let it all die on the vine while blaming conservatives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It is time for the Senate GOP to replace Mitch McConnell so that President Trump can actually get some of his legislative policies advanced. It is not conservatives who are the obstacle, but the Senate leader himself.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Mr. President, instead of considering a challenge to Jeff Flake, it might be time to send McConnell to the pasture.

Recessions and the presidents who inherited them,"Jan. 20, 2009: President Obama escorts former President Bush to a waiting helicopter behind the U.S. Capitol after Obama's inauguration ceremony in Washington.
	                        
	                        	 (Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Three of the last six U.S. presidents have inherited a recessionary economy: Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Let’s define “inheriting a recession” as meaning that on the date a president is sworn into office, the economy is technically still in recession or enters one within a few months.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Most economists would agree that presidents have little short-term control over the economy, but that their fiscal policies can be implemented quickly and affect macroeconomic performance after the first year.                 
                

            
                Reagan, inaugurated in January 1981, actually endured a double-dip recession—one that had been raging since early 1980 and a second that hit in July 1981—but the economy experienced a strong and sustained recovery that began in November 1982 during his second year in the White House.                 
                

            
                Bush was inaugurated in January 2001, and the economy entered recession just weeks later.                
                

            
                Obama entered office in January 2009, like Reagan, after the United States had been in recession for a full year.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                All three men could fairly claim they “inherited” a recession as well as fundamental economic problems. Reagan took over a nation experiencing double digit inflation and double digit interest rates. Bush took over an economy with a manufacturing sector in freefall and a crashed dot-com financial bubble. Months later, the nation was attacked on 9/11 and Wall Street was literally smoldering for months. Obama faced a financial crisis stemming from a burst real estate bubble.                
                

            
                However, the policy responses of the three presidents and economic results were markedly different. Reagan faced a divided Congress, whereas Bush and Obama enjoyed unified partisan control over Congress during their first 24 months in office.                
                

            
                Ronald Reagan worked with Democratic majorities in Congress to reform the US tax code and bring down the top marginal rate from 70 to 50 percent in 1981, then further to 28.5 percent in 1986.                 
                

            
                George Bush oversaw tax reforms that cut rates across the board in 2001, which were accelerated in 2003.                 
                

            
                Barack Obama maintained the income tax structure in place by default, but has worked tirelessly to raise top marginal rates. His signature domestic policy achievements were a near-trillion dollar stimulus (debt financed federal government expenditures) and major health care reform (which includes significant tax increases).                
                

            
                The Jobs Impact                
                

            
                The labor market is a coincident variable that moves up and down in tandem with the business cycle. When the economy is in recession, the labor market moves in lock step. Companies are reluctant to hire, jobless claims spike, and workers are often discouraged enough to leave the labor force.                 
                

            
                The unemployment rate is a demographically neutral measure of labor strength, unlike the count of payroll jobs which is sensitive to immigration and the age of the workforce. However, unemployment does not capture the effect of severe workforce discouragement.                 
                

            
                For a truly neutral metric, economists look at the ratio of total employment to total population, known as ""E-Pop.""                
                

            
                A historical look at the E-Pop is shown in Figure 1. Since 1990, E-Pop never fell below the 61 percent level until March of 2009. It hovered around 63 percent for two decades until the 2008 shock. The E-pop ratio dropped 4.5 percentage points during the recession, and has not recovered at all in the years since. During the Obama administration, the E-Pop ratio has been stuck between 58 and 59 percent.                
                

            
                To put the time series in context, Figure 2 shows the E-Pop’s movement before and after a common zero reference point for the six major recessions since 1970.                 
                

            
                The typical E-Pop pattern in previous recessionary cycles is actually remarkably steady compared to the random movements often observed in most other economic data. Specifically, the E-pop cycle has normally been a 1.5 to 3 percentage point decline over the first 24-months that recovers to normal at the 48-month point.                 
                

            
                There has been literally no recovery during the Obama administration, now 54 months after the recession began. The net decline of 4.5 percentage points is indeed unprecedented, but the fact that E-pop remains 4.0 points below its recent high is astounding. Each percentage point equals roughly 3 million U.S. jobs, meaning the economy is over 12 million jobs below potential.                
                

            
                The historical record shows that recessions are often inherited. All presidents face different challenges with unique headwinds and tailwinds.                 
                

            
                The severity of the 2007-2009 recession was uniquely large. On the other hand, no president enjoyed the tailwind of loose monetary policy during the same period on the scale provided by Bernanke’s Federal Reserve, nor the massive debt-financed government stimulus that continues to this day.                 
                

            
                As for unique challenges, no presidents aside from Franklin Roosevelt and George Bush suffered attacks on American soil like Pearl Harbor and 9/11.                 
                

            
                Certainly the current Federal Reserve’s supportive policies are a sharp contrast with the high interest rates Reagan faced.                 
                

            
                As for policy actions, no other president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 responded to a recession by raising taxes as aggressively as Obama.                 
                

            
                The results to date confirm that the high-tax, high-spend policy approach is failing to generate a real recovery, and worse, has created a new normal that is 12 million jobs below the old normal.

                The Affordable Care Act (ACA) is being described as one of the biggest threats small business faces today. However, entrepreneurs are not against health care reform; they are simply asking for a tune-up or common sense fixes, not a complete overhaul.

                For many years, I have served in both the public and private sector. As former head of the Small Business Administration, I learned about the challenges and desires of aspiring entrepreneurs and established employers regarding the tools necessary to start or grow an existing enterprise. But the biggest concern for these small business owners was health care and their options.                
                

            
                They were worried about escalating premiums, limited choices and inflation of costs due to frivolous lawsuits. In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that of the 45 million uninsured Americans, 22.3 million are self-employed or work for small businesses without benefits.                
                

            
                Initially, Obamacare was sold as a new and less expensive option for insurance provided through health exchanges. But the reality is that from small startup companies to large corporations, employers have more rules that keep changing and confusing requirements to keep track of. For most, costs are increasing and options are decreasing.                
                

            
                The Affordable Care Act is supposed to provide more plan options and rein in health care costs with competitive prices. Yet, small businesses are now being forced to comply with burdensome regulations and pay more taxes and fees. Companies employing 50 or more workers, who work more than 30 hours per week, are forced to provide them with mandated health insurance. And to make matters worse, the tax credit they were promised for up to 50 percent of their health care premium costs is only available if you have 10 or fewer full-time workers with a salary of less than $25,000 a year.                
                

            
                In essence, Obamacare is increasing small business costs, contributing to more of a part-time employee workforce and is causing hiring freezes in the sector of the economy that contributes to this nations overall financial prosperity.                
                

            
                Today, small business isn’t buying the promise of the Affordable Care Act.                 
                

            
                A recent Public Opinion Strategies survey of more than 400 business owners with 40 to 500 employees states that 64 percent of small business franchise owners believe the law will have a “negative impact” on their business. And more that one in four businesses (28 percent) say that in 2015, when the employer mandate is scheduled to take full effect, it is ""likely"" they will drop their insurance coverage and pay the penalty per employee.                
                

            
                This widespread anxiety is causing small businesses to be stymied because of over-regulation and economic uncertainty. And unfortunately, like bad fuel in an engine, if the rollout for the employer mandate is anywhere as grim as the individual mandate rollout, small businesses will continue feeling angst, uncertainty and the stagnation they have been experiencing for years.                
                

            
                This is not what American entrepreneurs hoped for, or expected.                
                

            
                We are looking for a real solution that will control spiraling health care costs and effective options, which have long been a worry and a source of anxiety for small business. We are asking for more health plan options and a real cost curve reduction in premiums that continue to spike up.                
                

            
                In short, we need and demand options, not mandates or a government takeover for millions of small businesses in the U.S. Small businesses deserve for their voices to be heard. Small business not only will lead our nation out of this economic morass; they will be pivotal in the expansion and growth of our economy for generations to come.                
                

            
                Is anyone listening?

              While there is far more to be done, President Trump has the right idea on health care reform.  The low hanging fruit is strategic deregulation, specifically rolling back the ACA-imposed requirements on health insurance that not only directly raised insurance premiums but furthered the inappropriate construct that insurance should minimize out-of-pocket payment for all medical care.  When insurance covers nearly everything, patients have little incentive to consider price of care, so doctors and hospitals don’t need to compete on price. The consequences are the overuse of health care and unrestrained costs.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The president’s directive will allow more insurance choices for millions of people who don’t want to buy bloated coverage filled with mandates for care they do not value and will not use. Part of this is the opportunity to buy insurance from other states and without the burden of ObamaCare’s “essential benefits” that increased premiums by almost 10 percent, and many of the 2,270 state coverage mandates for everything from acupuncture to marriage therapy. This will generate cheaper insurance.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Even more importantly, less comprehensive coverage and more widespread availability of high deductible plans will expose patients to paying directly for care. By doing so, patients will incorporate price into health care decisions, a lever critical to reducing the price of medical care itself. And the price of medical care is the major determinant of insurance premiums, the major factor in government health expenditures, and the major obstacle to health care.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Could people consider price for medical care? Yes - almost 60 percent of all expenditures by privately insured adults under age 65 is for elective outpatient care, and these are amenable to price-conscious purchasing.  Even for the top one percent of spenders who spend for more than 25 percent of all health spending, a full 45 percent is for outpatient care. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Additionally, the president noted the goal of expanding and deregulating tax-sheltered accounts. Employer provided HRAs (Health Reimbursement Arrangement) and independent HSAs (Health Saings Account) motivate patients to consider price, because account holders keep the money they don’t spend. These accounts are better than tax deductions, because they incentivize saving. Spending of patients with high deductible health plans paired with HSAs decreased at least 15 percent annually in a March 2015 study. When people have savings to protect in HSAs, the cost of care comes down without harmful impact on health. To maximize downward pressure on prices, HSAs should be also be available to seniors on Medicare, the most frequent users of health care. Raising maximum contributions, permitting tax-sheltered rollovers to surviving family members, and allowing HSA payments for the expenses of the holder’s elderly parents would also be significant deregulatory steps.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For patients to effectively seek out the best value for their money, more reforms must also occur.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              First, the visibility of information that patients require for assessing value must be radically improved.  We know that price transparency encourages price comparisons by patients for outpatient care like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and outpatient surgery.  Doctors and hospitals would certainly post prices and qualifications once they are competing for price-conscious patients empowered with control of the money.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Second, the supply of medical care must also be strategically increased.  We need to remove anti-competitive scope-of-practice limits on nurse practitioners and physician assistants, because they provide effective primary care that is 30 to 40 percent cheaper than that provided by doctors.  Additionally, about two-thirds of the 2025 projected doctor shortage of 124,000 will be in specialists, yet medical societies have maintained protectionist training program limits that restrict competition. Meanwhile, medical schools have prevented any increase in graduation numbers for almost 40 years. These longstanding anti-consumer practices should at least be opened to public scrutiny.  Simultaneously, archaic obstacles to competition among medical care providers must be eliminated, like state certificate-of-need requirements for installing competitive medical technology.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Third, introduce the right incentives into the tax code and eliminate the harmful, counterproductive incentives of  the current tax code. Today’s unlimited income exclusion from taxes for employer-provided health benefits encouraged higher demand for care, regardless of cost, while distorting insurance into covering almost all services. Likewise, artificially propping up high insurance premiums for bloated coverage that minimizes out-of-pocket payment via subsidies or tax credits prevents patients from caring about price. This reduces incentives for doctors to compete on price.  Any new tax reform should cap health care deductions and limit eligibility to catastrophic premiums and HSA contributions to incentivize patients to consider prices.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We know that focusing on increasing the number of people with health insurance by expanding government programs and subsidizing premiums is an ill-conceived approach that caused skyrocketing insurance premiums, fewer insurance options, and markedly fewer doctors accepting the insurance.  We also know that countries with single payer health care hold down costs by limiting the use of health care, with the expected long waits and worse medical outcomes, particularly for the poor and middle class who cannot circumvent those systems. Instead, America’s reforms should focus on reducing the price of medical care itself without restricting its use or creating obstacles to new drugs and technology.  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The key is to incentivize and equip consumers to consider price; strategically increase the supply of medical care to stimulate competition; and introduce the right incentives into the tax code. This is the best pathway to broaden access to high quality care for all Americans.

JUAN WILLIAMS: What You Need to Know About the First GOP Debate -- And What I Need From You,"What a week for politics. Usama bin Laden is dead. Even the president’s boldest Republican critics – read that as former Vice President Cheney – have expressed admiration for the Obama administration’s ability to locate and kill America’s number one enemy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But the 2012 presidential campaign is already underway with a field of Republican candidates taking shape. And that is where your faithful Fox News political analyst needs your help. I want you to send me questions for the candidates who will be on stage for the first debate of the GOP primary season.                
                

            
                The debate will be on the Fox News Channel this Thursday night, May 5 at 9 p.m. E.T.                
                

            
                I, along with my colleagues Bret Bair, Chris Wallace and Shannon Bream, will be quizzing the GOP candidates on a wide range of foreign and domestic policy issues. As the first round in the fight for the nomination this meeting will set the tone for the rest of the campaign. The primary field is having a hard time taking shape despite the fact that 80 percent of Republicans disapprove of President Obama’s performance in office.                
                

            
                So, I am asking for you to come up with the sharpest questions. Please send them to: foxforum@foxnews.com.
As you think about those questions, as a public service from your Fox News political analyst, here is all you need to know – your official scorecard.                
                

            
                Number one, don’t be fooled by the line-up. All the players will not be on the field Thursday. First here’s a list of the candidates who will be suiting up and appearing on the field: Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and Gary Johnson.                 
                

            
                One unique aspect of this debate is that for millions of Americans, even the most ardent Republicans, it will be the first time they have seen or heard these candidates.                
                

            
                Pawlenty will be the most plausible candidate for the nomination on stage Thrusday night. The former Minnesota governor’s calm and reasoned demeanor will set him apart from the far-right firebrands who will be on stage. His biggest challenge will be to resist the temptation to be pulled too far to the right.                 
                

            
                Santorum, Paul and Cain will undoubtedly be throwing rhetorical red meat to the South Carolina audience. Pawlenty has never shown the ability to compete with any of them as a performer and a showman. His strength is a good record of conservative policies from his tenure as governor of Minnesota. If he simply gives direct answers to the questions and does not get drawn into the contest for who can be the most outrageous conservative provocateur, it might be enough to make him a winner.                
                

            
                For the other four candidates on the stage the big debate is their best chance so far to make a winning impression on GOP voters. One of them could have a very big night and become the leader of the pack.                 
                

            
                GOP primary voters tend to be more conservative just as Democratic primary voters tend to be more liberal. Rick Santorum, Herman Cain, Ron Paul, Gary Johnson and Buddy Roemer are generally far to the right and wildcards. Their unabashed rhetoric might spark an Internet sensation and appeal to the voters who are want a GOP nominee who is the antithesis of politics as usual.                
                

            
                But will the lesser-known candidates know how to handle foreign policy questions? Can they demonstrate knowledge of economic issues? Send in those questions.                
                

            
                Now, here’s a list of candidates who will not be appearing on Thursday night: Michelle Bachmann, Mitch Daniels, Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin all will not be attending. Bachmann, Gingrich and Romney have been clear about their interest in pursuing the nomination. Daniels, Huckabee, Palin and Trump have been clearly hesitant to officially jump into the fray.                
                

            
                It’s my belief that Romney, the biggest star in the group, is not coming because he wants the Republican faithful, especially people with big money, to come to him out of frustration with a mediocre field and give him the nomination by acclamation.                
                

            
                But he knows that if he shows up he’ll be targeted by all the other candidates who want to bring down the biggest player. And he will have to endure question after question from the Fox team and his opponents about creating a universal health care plan in Massachusetts that closely mirrors the president’s controversial health care reform plan. So his strategy is to let the little guys fight it out before they get to challenge him.                
                

            
                If Gingrich showed up he will have to answer questions from all sides about his flip-flops on U.S. intervention in Libya.                 
                

            
                Daniels knows he’d be pressed to explain why ending funding for Planned Parenthood in Indiana last week was not just a crass effort to make up with social conservatives after saying that social issues should not be the focus of this year’s Republican primary.                 
                

            
                And Bachmann is worried about being buried under demands for her to explain incorrect statements such as the claim that the federal government controls more than half of the American economy and the American Revolution started in New Hampshire.                 
                

            
                And of course, Donald Trump would have to answer uncomfortable questions about having pursued the birther question to the detriment of the Republican Party.                
                

            
                In 2008, by the time of the first primary debate, all of the major candidates had declared their intentions and showed up for the first debate. John McCain, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Huckabee went into the debate with their campaigns in full swing. Even the lesser-known candidates -- Ron Paul, Duncan Hunter, Tom Tancredo, Tommy Thompson, and Jim Gilmore – had made several trips to the early primary states and were in campaign mode. Only former Senator Fred Thompson waited several months to get into the race and found himself unable to catch up to the other candidates.                
                

            
                The 2012 season is off to a late start but it will be a spirited one. The other potential candidates will be watching. With the death of Usama Bin Laden, one wonders if any of the Republican candidates will be less enthusiastic about the getting the opportunity to take on the commander-in-chief this time around.

                They’re practically the first words out of one’s mouth the second a Washington reporter hears about a new health reform proposal: ""How many people does your plan cover?""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The basic premise of the America Next health plan I’m endorsing today is simple: “I believe the problem is not that folks are trying to avoid getting health care. The problem is they can’t afford it.”                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                In short, I agree with Barack Obama.                
                

            
                Of course, Barack Obama circa January 2008—when he uttered those words in opposition to a health insurance mandate -- represents a far cry from the Barack Obama who signed ObamaCare into law in March 2010.

                The president backtracked on nearly every single promise he made: on an individual mandate, keeping your plan, cutting premiums by $2,500 per year, and even on taxing health benefits -- all in the name of achieving the left’s utopia of “universal coverage.” And in return, America has been left with shredded promises, cancelled insurance plans, and a major-league case of buyer’s remorse.                
                

            
                So no, I won’t endorse a plan that sees tens of millions of Americans forced to buy health insurance under pain of taxation.                 
                

            
                I won’t endorse a plan that sees millions of other Americans forced out of the insurance they like, simply because it doesn’t meet some Washington bureaucrat’s standards. And I won’t endorse a plan that sees Americans extended the promise of insurance, only to find out that the “coverage” provided doesn’t guarantee they’ll receive the care they need.                 
                

            
                We already have all that -- it’s called ObamaCare, and it needs to be fully repealed, because it’s the problem.                
                

            
                Here’s the solution.                
                

            
                First, we need to focus like a laser beam on the health care issue Americans care most about:rising costs.                 
                

            
                The plan I’m endorsing includes an innovative $100 billion grant program that incentivizes our “laboratories of democracy”—the states—to come up with insurance reforms and other solutions that can stem the rising tide of health costs. States’ eligibility for the grants would be tied to their ability to lower insurance premiums for their citizens.                
                

            
                We include other reforms in our plan too -- tax equity between employer and individually-purchased health plans, lawsuit reform, wellness incentives, and new incentives for Health Savings Accounts.                 
                

            
                These reforms have proven track records of success -- and analysis from top economists to back them up.                 
                

            
                In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, analyzing a similar state-based approach in 2009, concluded that the kinds of ideas included in our plan would lower premiums on the individual health insurance market by $5,000 per year when compared to current projections. That, and not ObamaCare “rate shock,” is true change America can believe in.                
                

            
                Second, we need to protect the safety net for the most vulnerable. As someone whose mother arrived on these shores pregnant with me, I’m well aware of the plight of Americans with pre-existing conditions. I was one -- from birth.                 
                

            
                My son Shaan’s desperate fight for survival from a childhood heart defect reinforced my belief in making sure those with major illnesses don’t get left out in the cold. But we didn’t need to give up all the good things in the system to fix the bad. Extending coverage to Americans with pre-existing conditions didn’t require throwing millions of Americans off their current plans, or turning the IRS into the health insurance police.                
                

            
                Here’s a better solution. Our plan’s state grant program requires states applying for grants to guarantee access for individuals with pre-existing conditions. A state could guarantee access through a high-risk pool, through reinsurance, or through some other mechanism. But our plan ensures that the most vulnerable won’t fall through the cracks, and provides $100 billion in resources that states can use to subsidize that coverage.                
                

            
                Third, we should make insurance more portable, to enhance personal choice. Rather than taking away choices by regulatory fiat, we should give Americans more insurance options, so they can purchase plans they will own, hold, and keep. But if people like their existing plan, they won’t have to worry about it getting taken away by some government bureaucrat saying it doesn’t comply with a new mandate.                
                

            
                As someone who studied public policy in college, and worked in health policy all my adult life, I know ObamaCare is bad policy.                 
                

            
                The law may have been sold as a solution to the problem of pre-existing conditions. But it solidifies government -- through taxes, mandates, regulations, and your friendly bureaucrats at the IRS -- as a pre-existing condition in our health care system, and in the lives of all Americans.                
                

            
                That’s not reform.                
                

            
                As a governor, I know states can do better. We need solutions, but not Washington-centric bureaucracy disguised as “reform”—we’ve done that already, and it hasn’t worked.                 
                

            
                By contrast, conservative governors throughout the country have implemented successful health reforms -- from the Hoosier State’s Healthy Indiana Plan, to Rhode Island’s innovative Medicaid waiver, to the Bayou Health program we’ve created right here in Louisiana. These reforms have lowered costs -- in some cases dramatically -- improved the quality of care, and received widespread public support.                
                

            
                But in many states, including Louisiana, we would go further with our reforms, if only Washington bureaucrats would get out of the way. At the risk of echoing Churchill, that’s the better way forward on health care -- give states the tools, and let them do the job.                
                

            

            
                
                    
                
                


 

	Republican Bobby Jindal is governor of Louisiana and a former Republican candidate for president of the United States."
ObamaCare is already a success,"Just in time for the two-year anniversary of the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments on the law’s constitutionality this week.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This is a political column. So let’s leave the litigation and questions of constitutionality to the lawyers.                
                

            
                In my world of people and politics there are two relevant issues. First, does the law provide better medical care for Americans? And is it reducing the cost of health care?                
                

            
                While the new law will not be fully implemented until 2014, the parts that have been enacted show that the indisputable, factual answer to both questions is “yes.” But at the moment, the facts do not seem to matter in the court of public opinion. Republican opposition remains as solid today as the day the act was signed into law.                
                

            
                Overall, a March 11 Bloomberg poll found that 37 percent of Americans say it should be repealed, 46 percent want to wait to see how it works and 11 percent think it should be left just the way it is.                
                

            
                The Wall Street Journal reported last week that 50.5 percent of all Americans oppose the law. That is almost exactly the same level of opposition as there was in 2010. One aspect of that opposition that needs to be highlighted is that more than 20 percent of Americans are opposed because they want the law to do more. Specifically, they want it to include a public option for insurance coverage to put more pressure on insurance companies to lower their rates and requirements for coverage.                
                

            
                Still, according to the Journal’s in-depth reporting, the act’s biggest failure so far concerns a temporary plan to offer coverage to uninsured people before the full law takes effect in 2014. Costly premiums and tight rules for enrollment have led to fewer people than expected signing up. And some states have run out of money for the plan where people have signed up.                
                

            
                Another problem cited by critics is that thousands of companies have found it difficult to get insurance, especially for part-time workers, under new rules limiting the ability of insurers to set ceilings for annual claims and payments.                
                

            
                That’s it. Those two small areas are identified as the law’s big problems. That is the heart of the criticism.                
                

            
                There are other valid criticisms out there, but all of it amounts to nothing compared to the law’s success.                
                

            
                Already, the Obama health care reform has succeeded in preventing insurance companies from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions and allowing young adults to stay on their parent’s health insurance until they turn 26. And many other parts of the law have begun to improve the lives of millions of Americans.                
                

            
                For example, it already requires insurance companies to provide coverage for preventive services such as immunization, screenings and counseling services. In 2011, almost 33 million Medicare beneficiaries and 54 million Americans with private insurance used these services for free. Starting this summer, millions of women will be able to have free mammograms and health counseling.                
                

            
                The Act also closed the costly prescription drug coverage gap in Medicare Part D, more commonly known as the “doughnut hole.” Four million seniors and disabled citizens have saved an estimated $3.2 billion on prescription drugs. More savings are ahead as the law becomes fully implemented.                
                

            
                Americans enrolled in Medicare Advantage — or “Medicare Part C” — have had their premiums lowered by 16 percent since 2010, giving seniors access to inexpensive, quality health care.                
                

            
                Also, due to new enforcement powers given to the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare claims were stopped in 2011. This constitutes the single largest sum ever recovered in a single year from individuals and companies attempting to defraud the American taxpayer.                
                

            
                The bottom line is the reforms are leading to higher-quality care and increasing consumer protection while bending the cost curve of health care.                
                

            
                Back in 2009, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Congress must pass health care reform so the American people can find out what is in it. This was an unfortunate statement. It led GOP critics to say Democrats want the public to buy the metaphorical “Pig in Poke.”                
                

            
                But based on what the nation has now seen of the law, the pig is looking like a blue-ribbon winner, a good deal for seniors and the middle class. The only question is whether a good idea can survive bad-mouthing from GOP politicians and hard-right politics on the Supreme Court.

JUAN WILLIAMS: ObamaCare vs. the GOP -- Score One for the White House,"When it comes to health care reform it is amazing how times change – how polls change – how politics stays the same.
A year ago today , when President Obama signed his national health care plan into law the polls showed most American opposed to it. The bitterness born of phony charges of “death panels,” angry seniors complaining about possible cuts in Medicare benefits and Tea Party marchers screaming at members of Congress had much of the nation in a tizzy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Now public opinion on the bill has taken on a sunny outlook. More Americans have a favorable view of the bill than have an unfavorable view. According to a Gallup poll earlier this month, 46% of Americans think it was a “good thing” while 40% think it was a “bad thing” with 10% undecided.                
                

            
                But as I mentioned, while the polling on Obama’s health care reform may have changed in the last year, the politics have not changed.                
                

            
                The lack of credible Republican alternatives for fixing a broken health care system that was driving big business and families into financial trouble has not changed. When asked what they do would instead, the GOP responds with the same tired, discredited talking points they used one year ago.                
                

            
                They still talk about the need for tort reform even though medical malpractice insurance premiums account for less than one percent of all health care costs. They still talk about the need for competition across state lines even though this would create a veritable race to the bottom as insurance companies are sure to move to the states with the least regulation so they can provide the lowest quality of coverage at the cheapest price.                
                

            
                The GOP has also derided the law as unconstitutional because it effectively forces people to buy health insurance ignoring the fact that government makes everyone pay taxes, issues everyone a Social Security card, and has been forcing people to buy auto insurance for decades. Republican state Attornies General have their knickers in a knot over this and their lawsuits will likely end up in the Supreme Court. The only way the court rules against the new health care plan is if the vote is along purely partisan lines and that will be a bigger tragedy for the court than for the rest of the nation.                
                

            
                The bigger issue on the table at the moment is that House Republicans have not passed a single alternative health care reform bill since they have been in charge but they have passed bills to repeal and defund the law. All of these bills, however, are dead on arrival in the Senate making the whole exercise futile and symbolic.                
                

            
                At a meeting of the nation’s governors last month, President Obama called the GOP’s bluff on health care. He challenged GOP governors -- like South Carolina’s Nikki Haley and New Jersey’s Chris Christie who have echoed party line complaints against what they call “ObamaCare” -- to come up with their own health care plans that meet the goals of the Affordable Care Act.                
                

            
                He challenged the governors, saying, ""I am not open to re-fighting the battles of the last two years, or undoing the progress that we’ve made. But I am willing to work with anyone — anybody in this room, Democrat or Republican, governors or member of Congress — to make this law even better; to make care even better; to make it more affordable and fix what needs fixing.""                
                

            
                That includes not driving up the deficit. So the president opened the door to the states, as what he called the laboratories of democracy, putting their own ideas on the table for reducing costs, increasing access and improving quality.                
                

            
                Since then, the silence has been deafening and the American people are beginning to see that the GOP really doesn’t have any alternative ideas on health care that fit the bill.                
                

            
                Keep in mind that many of the most consequential parts of the Obama health law will not take effect until 2012, 2013 and 2014. Keep in mind that several companies have had to request waivers to continue coverage for low-income workers. The health care bill is still a work in progress. The jury will be out until at least 2014 on the public reaction to the full implementation of the law. But a year ago the critics predicted the sky was about to fall and lack of public support for health care reform would doom President Obama. It didn’t. Obama’s latest approval numbers are about 50 percent and health care is nowhere near a dominant, doom issue.                
                

            
                For the sake of the Republican presidential nominee who will have to debate Obama on health care during the 2012 campaign next year, they had better come up with some. Oh, wait, Mitt Romney did just that when he was governor of Massachusetts. And now he is having to distance himself from his signature accomplishment because the official Republican stance remains to use that issue as a political truncheon to beat up the President.                
                

            
                Well, maybe now Obama can get some medical help.

                As lies go, this one should be setting off alarms. But except for a Washington Post rebuke, it only raised a few eyebrows. That could be a sign of how many Americans expect routine dishonesty from politicians, including President Obama.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The issue involves the medical care of his late mother, Stanley Ann Dunham. In arguing for health care reform, Obama said in a 2008 debate that, “For my mother to die of cancer at the age of 53 and have to spend the last months of her life in the hospital room arguing with insurance companies because they’re saying that this may be a pre-existing condition and they don’t have to pay her treatment, there’s something fundamentally wrong about that.”                
                

            
                It’s a touching story, and untrue.                 
                

            
                A biographer later revealed that the dispute was over disability insurance, not medical coverage or care. And Obama must have known that because he was his mother’s lawyer, and the White House didn’t dispute the biographer.                
                

            
                Yet the story, largely as Obama first told it, has reappeared in “The Road We’ve Traveled,” his campaign’s 17-minute infomercial. As the Post describes it, the video stitches together vague statements from narrator Tom Hanks and First Lady Michelle Obama to make it seem as if the president’s mother died arguing with insurance companies over coverage.                
                

            
                “The impression left by the film is very similar to Obama’s 2008 campaign rhetoric,” the paper’s Fact Checker column concludes. It calls the sequence “misleading” and awards the video three Pinocchios, out of a possible four.                
                

            
                That’s our president, folks, for whom the end always justifies the means.

                In recent weeks, the national media have been obsessed with highlighting divisions and disagreements among Republicans on Capitol Hill. It’s time for GOP lawmakers to remind the American people of what unites us.
 
 Republicans are united in our desire to dismantle President Obama’s health care law and replace it with patient-centered alternatives that reduce costs, expand quality insurance coverage, and improve access to care.                                             ADVERTISEMENT

                We’re united in our desire to simplify the U.S. tax code and encourage job creation by lowering marginal rates and broadening the base.

                To appoint constitutionalist judges who will faithfully uphold our founding document.
 
 In other words, what unites Republicans is far more significant than what divides Republicans.                
                

            
                The disagreements of the past month have mostly been about tactics rather than policy. But those disagreements are now behind us.                 
                

            
                Moving forward, if Republicans want to maximize our leverage and achieve conservative policy gains, we must remain united and focus on issues where President Obama and the Democrats are clearly vulnerable.
 
 For example: The administration spent more than $400 million to get the ObamaCare health exchanges up and running by October 1, but so far they’ve been a total disaster.                 
                

            
                Across the country, people have found it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to sign up. Indeed, only a tiny fraction of all visitors to the official Obamacare website have successfully enrolled.                 
                

            
                Polls have consistently shown that most Americans want to delay ObamaCare’s personal health insurance mandate.
 
 Republicans agree that, at the very least, Washington should delay the mandate for individuals and families, especially since President Obama has unilaterally delayed the corresponding mandate for employers.                 
                

            
                We also agree that health-care reform should not (1) impose a trillion-dollar tax hike, (2) discourage full-time hiring, (3) drive up insurance premiums, (4) cause large numbers of Americans to lose their existing coverage, (5) weaken Medicare and Medicaid, or (6) hamper medical innovation.                 
                

            
                ObamaCare does all of these things.                 
                

            
                In the months ahead, Republicans should continue making the case for alternative reforms that would expand quality insurance coverage while simultaneously lowering costs and improving patient access.
 
 In addition, we should continue pressing the Obama administration to approve the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. Amid the worst unemployment crisis since the 1930s -- at a time when millions of Americans have been jobless for more than six months and our labor-force participation rate has fallen to a 35-year low -- there is no good reason to oppose an energy project that would create thousands of well-paying middle-class jobs and reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern, Russian, and Venezuelan oil.
 
 Speaking of job creation, Republicans should keep up the drumbeat for pro-growth, revenue-neutral tax reform. Americans now spend roughly 6.1 billion hours each year complying with IRS filing requirements. That represents a massive waste of time, money, and energy for businesses and individuals alike.                 
                

            
                Republicans overwhelmingly support a simpler, more logical tax system with lower marginal rates and fewer loopholes. That’s a winning message, and it’s one we should aggressively promote.
 
 Finally, Republicans should remain united in blocking Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s attempt to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which is America’s second-most-influential judicial body.                 
                

            
                Senator Reid has made no secret of his intent: Over the summer, he told Nevada Public Radio that Democrats were hoping to “switch the majority” on the D.C. Circuit to make it a rubberstamp for big-government liberalism. Republicans have objected to this power grab, and we should continue to do so.                 
                

            
                Based on its caseload, the D.C. Circuit simply does not need more judges at the present time.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, there are plenty of appellate courts that are overburdened and do need more judges. Our priority should be to fill those vacancies, not to let Harry Reid stack a single court.
 
 Republicans will always have internal debates, but -- more importantly -- we share a determination to reverse the destructive policies of the past five years.                 
                

            
                The results of Obamanomics speak for themselves: Since June of 2009, we have experienced the weakest economic recovery and the longest stretch of high unemployment in postwar history.                
                

            
                The president claims to be deeply troubled by income inequality. And yet, as the New York Times reported in late August, the trend of rising income inequality “appears to have accelerated during the Obama administration” (my emphasis).                 
                

            
                Indeed, according to one measure of the income gap, inequality has increased about four times faster under President Obama than it did under President Bush.
 
 Republicans want to restore the economic and constitutional principles that made our country the envy of the world.                 
                

            
                Conservative health-care policies would help all Americans obtain quality insurance coverage and quality care.                 
                

            
                Conservative tax policies would make it easier to raise families, start businesses, and save for retirement.                 
                

            
                Conservative energy policies would create thousands of jobs and bolster national security.                 
                

            
                Conservative regulatory policies would end “too big to fail.”                
                

            
                With President Obama sitting in the White House and Democrats controlling the Senate, these policies face an uphill battle. No question about it.                 
                

            
                Yet by remaining united behind common values and common interests, Republicans have a chance to win substantial short-term victories -- and set the stage for much bigger victories in the future.

                With Senate Judiciary committee getting ready to vote on Senator Jeff Sessions’ confirmation today, the letter is being used as Exhibit A for many liberals arguing that experts view Sessions as unqualified and outside the mainstream.                
                

            
                But with 17,080 faculty members nationwide, perhaps the real question is why there were so few signers. Only 8.3 percent of faculty members signed the letter.                
                

            
                Given that 82 percent of law professors identified themselves as Democrats in 2010, one can infer that only about 10 percent of Democrat professors signed the letter.                
                

            
                From 1991 to 2002, over 23 percent of law professors at the top 20 law schools contributed at least $200 exclusively or mostly to Democrats. By contrast, just 4 percent of law professors were active Republican donors. Assuming that over 23 percent figure has held true today (and given the inordinate hatred for Trump, this might be an underestimate), just a third of active donors to Democrats signed the letter.                
                

            
                The letter itself is written vaguely to maximize signatures. There is a regurgitation of charges made in 1986 that Sessions was “prejudice[d] against African Americans.” It continues: “Some of us have concerns about … his consistent promotion of the myth of voter-impersonation fraud ... his support for building a wall along our country’s southern border … his robust support for regressive drug policies that have fueled mass incarceration … his repeated opposition to legislative efforts to promote the rights of women and the members of the LGBTQ community.”                
                

            
                The faculty members could disagree with all of these points and still be able to sign the letter. Indeed, it is hard to find any other letter signed by academics (and there are a lot of them) that offers so many escape clauses for signers. But the goal was to get signatures, not to provide a coherent argument against Sessions.                
                

            
                The charges themselves are absurd.                
                

            
                Take their first claim. Only liberal academics would believe that “voter-impersonation fraud” is a myth.                
                

            
                A recent study in the peer-reviewed journal Electoral Studies estimated that illegal aliens cast about 1.4 million votes in the 2008 and 2010 elections, and that their votes “likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.”                
                

            
                Here are some cases of suspected impersonation fraud discovered during just the month-and-a-half prior to the November election:                
                

            
                • San Pedro, Calif.: 83 absentee ballots were sent to different registered voters who all supposedly lived in the same small, two-bedroom apartment. If not for an observant neighbor, this case would never have been discovered.                
                

            
                • Pennsylvania: Democrat organization FieldWorks LLC was raided by Pennsylvania State Police on allegations that it fraudulently filled out registration forms for thousands of voters.                
                

            
                • Indiana: State police “believe there could be hundreds of fraudulent voter registration records with different combinations of made up names and addresses with people’s real information.“                
                

            
                • Chicago: An investigation by CBS-2 found that “119 dead people have voted a total of 229 times in Chicago in the last decade.”                
                

            
                • Virginia: After examining just eight of the state’s 133 counties, 1,046 illegal aliens were discovered to already be registered voters.                
                

            
                • New York City: In an undercover video, Democrats themselves were caught complaining about the amount of voter fraud created by Mayor Bill de Blasio’s decision to give out ID cards without checking recipients’ identities.                
                

            
                The law professors’ second claim doesn’t cite any specific concerns about the wall along the Mexican border. So there is nothing to respond to.                
                

            
                Their third claim blames drug crimes for mass incarceration. But in 2012, only 20 percent of inmates at state and federal prisons were incarcerated for possessing or trafficking any type of illegal drugs — and those sentences were primarily for trafficking hard drugs. Data from Arizona indicate that as few as 0.3 percent of inmates were incarcerated for marijuana possession, and these are rare individuals who have been arrested multiple times. In California, only 1 percent of state prisoners are incarcerated for any type of marijuana-related offense.                
                

            
                The fourth claim doesn’t mention any specific things that Sessions has done to harm women or others.  But presumably it focuses what was raised during the hearings, Sessions’ vote against the Violence Against Women Act.  But neither law professors nor his opponents during the hearings over the last two days have seriously addressed Sessions explanation for his vote.  Sessions had previously supported the Act, but opposed its renewal in 2012 over concerns that it was unconstitutional when changes were made expanding Indian tribes’ jurisdiction over non-tribal members.  Tribal courts also have a history of failing to provide adequate legal protections to defendants.  No evidence was ever provided that prosecuting non-tribal members in US courts posed any problems to protecting Indians.                
                

            
                Academics keep making fools of themselves with letters like this, which have everything to do with not wanting a Republican attorney general who supports policies they disagree with. Their letter has nothing to do with Sessions’ ability to uphold the law in good faith.

CBO vs. HHS: Guesswork vs. proven history on the harm ObamaCare has done,"As the media trumpeted news recently of the Congressional Budget Office score on the American Health Care Act, they largely ignored data released by the Department of Health and Human Services outlining the damage done by ObamaCare.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                In my home state of North Carolina, average premiums on the individual market have gone up by $422 per month, or more than $5,000 a year, since 2013.  Consider the impact on someone with a $50,000 salary.  Making matters worse, 95 out of 100 counties in North Carolina have only one carrier – Blue Cross & Blue Shield, and even BCBS seriously considered pulling out last year.  Aetna, Humana, and United Healthcare have also pulled out of ObamaCare markets nationwide. 
                
                


                
            
                The results in North Carolina are not anomalies.  Nationwide, average premiums have gone up by nearly $3,000 under ObamaCare.  Quite the opposite from what President Obama promised when he said a typical family’s premiums would go down by $2,500.
                
                


                
            
                As far as choices go, last year one third of all counties nationwide had only one insurer offering coverage through ObamaCare.  That is nearly 2 million Americans who were only able to pick from one health insurer.  And the situation is only getting worse.  Recently, Blue Cross announced it will pull out of 32 counties in Kansas and Missouri, potentially leaving 25 of those counties with no coverage in 2018.
                
                


                
            
                These are the facts of what we know has happened thanks to ObamaCare.
                
                


                
            
                Ironically, while the Health and Human Services report is based on facts, the Congressional Budget Office report only provides unsupported conclusions, as it is based on highly questionable predictions.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                With best efforts, the CBO report is elusive in its prediction of outcomes.  Just take the CBO’s word for it.  On page 32, the CBO report states:  “estimates are inherently uncertain because the ways in which federal agencies, states, insurers, employers, individuals, doctors, hospitals, and other affected parties would respond to the changes made by the legislation are all difficult to predict.”
                
                


                
            
                The report continues:  “predicting the overall effects of the myriad ways that states could implement those waivers is especially difficult.”
                
                


                
            
                Their caution is well-founded.  A review of the CBO’s ObamaCare projections reveals how flawed their prediction models on health care have been.  Discussions around these predictions include a lot of numbers, acronyms, and technical language, but anyone can see from the CBO’s record that their analysis is far from gold.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO estimated 23 million people would enroll in the ObamaCare exchanges by 2016.  The actual number was around 10 million.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO predicted 4 million people would enroll in an ObamaCare small business program.  The actual number is 233,000.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO claimed the ObamaCare risk corridor program would result in a profit of $8 billion for the government.  The program ended up with a multibillion dollar deficit because ObamaCare was never actuarially sound.  To ensure this didn’t result in a massive taxpayer bailout of big insurance companies, I wrote a letter to HHS last October, co-signed by 45 additional Members of Congress, emphasizing the full commitment of Congress to block any backdoor bailout of ObamaCare losses.
                
                


                
            
                · The CBO projected Medicaid expansion would cost $42 billion.  The actual cost was $68 billion.
                
                


                
            
                These facts speak for themselves and beg for a reality check.
                
                


                
            
                While the CBO score is of limited value, their report is clear that the American Health Care Act will reduce premiums and also reduce the deficit by $119 billion.
                
                


                
            
                But setting aside projection models, at the heart of the debate over ObamaCare is a fundamental question regarding the federal government’s role in health care.  Should the government require every individual to buy health insurance?  Of course not, and naturally, when you repeal a mandate to purchase something, fewer folks will ultimately buy it.
                
                


                
            
                The ObamaCare approach - top-down, one-size-fits-all health care for everyone - clearly has not worked.  The result has been higher premiums, higher deductibles and fewer choices.
                
                


                
            
                The American Health Care Act approach, on the other hand, gives states flexibility and puts patients back in control of their health care.  This will allow Americans to choose the coverage best for them and their family.
                
                


                
            
                The Senate will surely make its changes to the bill, and the House will certainly have our say on those changes, but Republicans are united in our fundamental principles for health care reform.  We need to rescue our health care system from the ObamaCare death spiral and establish patient-centered, market-driven solutions to lower costs while protecting those with pre-existing conditions.  The American Health Care Act will deliver on these principles.

                The most intriguing political race of 2012 is a congressional campaign hidden away in central Utah. Republicans are in full attack mode against the only Democrat in Utah’s congressional delegation.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                No surprise that the Republican candidate is a Mormon. The surprise is that she is a black woman.                
                

            
                As the Washington Post noted in a recent profile of 37-year-old Mia Love: “If she wins, not only would she help Republicans keep control of the House, but she would become the first black Republican woman to serve in Congress. Love, who is Mormon, also could go a long way toward helping presidential candidate Mitt Romney, putting a fresh face on his church and his Party as both try to appeal to an increasingly diverse nation.”                
                

            
                Those dynamics help to explain why a little congressional race in Utah is getting a lot of attention in Washington. Love has already been endorsed by GOP heavyweights like Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy and Ann Romney.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                Love is running against Jim Matheson, a six-term Democratic incumbent who serves on the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is the co-chairman of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of conservative and moderate Democrats in Congress known for bucking their party’s leadership.                
                

            
                The last remaining Democrat in the Utah delegation, Matheson won his 2010 re-election race by less than 5 points.                
                

            
                Because of population gains, Utah gained a fourth congressional seat after the 2010 census and the GOP-dominated state legislature has redistricted Matheson into the new district with even more registered Republicans.                
                

            
                Moderates in Congress are fast becoming an endangered species – on both sides of the aisle.                
                

            
                According to the 2010 National Journal Rankings, Matheson was more conservative than 51 percent of his colleagues in the House and more liberal than 49 percent. This makes him one of the most centrist members of Congress.                
                

            
                In 2008, there were 56 Blue Dogs – conservative Democrats -- in the House. After the 2010 elections, there were only 26.                
                

            
                To strengthen his conservative credentials, Matheson voted against President Obama’s health care reform law and voted in favor of holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress over Fast and Furious. It seems to be working for him.                
                

            
                A June poll from Desert News/KSL showed Matheson leading Love by 15 points. The incumbent also has a commanding lead in fundraising with more than $1 million dollars in his campaign war chest.                
                

            
                But keep in mind that Love only locked up the GOP nomination at the state convention in April. The amount of money she has collected since then has been roughly equal to what Matheson has raised.                
                

            
                Love is attracting national attention as the conservative mayor of Saratoga Springs and one of the few African-Americans in Utah. The state has a 1.3 percent black population compared to the nation’s 13 percent black population.                
                

            
                If Love wins, she will instantly become a conservative celebrity – a new face for conservatism and a lure for the GOP to use to recruit more candidates who are female and persons of color.                
                

            
                Like Marco Rubio, her parents are immigrants and she is uniquely qualified to reach out to the growing immigrant population who views the GOP as hostile.                
                

            
                If elected, Love will join Reps. Allen West of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina as black Republican members of the House. Love does not mouth West's fiery Tea Party rhetoric. But there is no doubt that she is a strong conservative.                
                

            
                She is pro-life, pro-gun and favors eliminating the Department of Education and the Department of Energy.                 
                

            
                She also says that she would like to join the Congressional Black Caucus so that she can ""try to take that thing apart from the inside out” because, according to her, ""They sit there and ignite emotions and ignite racism when there isn’t.

Health Care Law Is Major Achievement for Obama Administration,"With President Obama's landmark health care law, the Affordable Care Act, hitting its one year anniversary it’s time to reflect: was it good or bad for America?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Well, unless you like insurance companies denying treatment for pre-existing conditions or rescinding coverage after a person gets sick or lifetime caps that don’t begin to cover treatments for serious diseases, you would have to agree it has been a net benefit.                
                

            
                Or perhaps you miss the days when people were trapped in jobs because they had a medical issue that prevented them from leaving for fear of having their coverage denied under a new health care plan. According to research at MIT, 1.6 million small business workers suffer from “job lock.”                
                

            
                As David Kendall at the centrist think tank Third Way pointed out to me, if the Affordable Care Act is repealed, insurers will again be able to discriminate against our children because of a pre-existing condition. Last year, roughly 19 million children may have had a pre-existing condition, 540,000 of whom were uninsured.                
                

            
                But it’s a “government takeover of health care,” the detractors scream.                
                

            
                Far from it.                
                

            
                In fact, PolitiFact named this notion the “Lie of the Year.”                
                

            
                The truth is, President Obama’s health care plan was but one step in the direction of the kind of health care reform the U.S. really needs. There simply is nothing in the law that establishes government-run health care.                
                

            
                Instead, there are health care exchanges made up of private insurers. If this is what passes for socialism, it’s pretty weak tea.                
                

            
                Then there is the hue and cry about the individual mandate. What makes conservative criticism of this so strange is that it was once an idea championed by the right that fit nicely with the “individual responsibility” theme. In fact, a July 1990 Heritage Foundation proposal recommended that the “government [should] require by law every head of household to acquire at least a basic health plan for his or her family.”                
                

            
                Another criticism of Obama’s plan is that health insurance premiums are going up. But they have been going up for ten years. If Obama’s plan had never passed, they still would have gone up. Gary Claxton, a vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that for many plans federal reforms account for maybe ""1½ percent"" of the rise in premiums.                
                

            
                In Ohio, the Department of Insurance told the Plain Dealer that ""federal reforms are generally raising the rates less than 5 percent"" and ""the other part of it is medical inflation and the continuing trend of rising health care costs."" Where there are higher premiums they are also likely linked to better coverage.                
                

            
                There is still much to be done in the area of health care reform, especially regarding reigning in the out of control increase in health care spending in this country. First and foremost should be a measure that would change the fee-for-service structure that incentivizes doctors to do unnecessary tests or perform more expensive procedures that will get a higher reimbursement rate.                
                

            
                President Obama himself has indicated that the law is just a first step and is open to revisions and betterment. He demonstrated this with his openness to eliminating small employers’ need to file 1099 forms, something both parties can actually agree on.                
                

            
                The Affordable [Health] Care Act is far from perfect, but it is indisputably better than what we had before and counts as a major achievement for the Obama administration.

"Opinion: Obamacare should be a hand up, not a handout to those in need","In 2012, Nancy Pelosi ominously declared that Congress needed to pass the health care reform bill so the public could find out what was in it. Unfortunately, ever since that fateful day, Americans have been plagued with one bad health care surprise after another.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Millions of people have lost their coverage since the passage of the “Affordable” Care Act (despite President Obama’s promise to the contrary). In addition, it has recently become known that health care premiums are poised for a sharp rise in 2016—again, despite the promises that the President and Democrats made when Obamacare was signed into law. And let’s not forget that a Supreme Court decision in the pending King v. Burwell case might result in the dismantling of federally-run Obamacare exchanges.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            It should be obvious that attacking an effective, revenue-neutral program that helps patients in need receive vital medications is just not the best way to address the many issues facing American families when it comes to health care.

                It is clear that no matter the outcome of the Supreme Court case, Obamacare – as it was conceived – is unlikely to weather ongoing scrutiny. With that in mind, it’s time for a fact-based examination of the health care policies that work (versus those that have utterly failed).                
                

            
                It is strange, then, that out of all the challenges faced by the system, some Republican Members of Congress are turning their attention to a decades-old, cost-neutral health care program that directly benefits patients in need. The 340B drug-pricing program should be a shining example of the way the safety net is supposed to work, yet it is now coming under fire.                
                

            
                The program has been around for over 20 years; President George H.W. Bush signed it into law in 1992 in order to “stretch scarce federal resources” by easing costs for providers who are designated as “critical access.”  Currently, pharmaceutical companies that participate in Medicaid must sell medication to critical access hospitals at a discount. In return for their voluntary participation, companies gain access to millions of customers – and although those customers pay a discounted rate, companies still receive significant payments for their products. In 2012, sales of medications under the 340B program totaled $6.9 billion.

                At a time when hospitals (especially those in rural and inner-city areas serving working class patients) are closing their doors at an alarming rate, Republicans should be working to double down on effective health care policies. Savings under the 340B program enable critical access hospitals to serve low-income and underserved patients in need of vital medicines. These “safety net” hospitals are the first line of defense for communities struggling to provide basic health care to their citizens.                
                

            
                At the end of the day, the 340B program allows patients who might otherwise not be able to receive necessary medication to purchase those medications through critical access hospitals – and struggling hospitals that serve at-risk patients are able to keep their lights on and their books balanced. And for those who are concerned with the high cost of health care in America, it is worth stressing that the 340B program is one of the (very few) public health policies that does not cost taxpayers a dime.                 
                

            
                New limits on hospital eligibility to participate in the program will restrict patient access and directly harm at-risk patients. And all taxpayers stand to take a hit, as increased Medicare costs that would result from scaling back the 340B program would of course fall on their shoulders.                
                

            
                In addition, more critical access hospitals themselves would face financial burdens that magnify the pressures that have forced many to close their doors. With each hospital closure comes a new community crisis, and the lost jobs and patient access problems that naturally follow. The numbers are staggering: 16 rural hospitals closed in 2014 alone, while from 1970-2010, more than 300 urban hospitals closed in inner cities around the country.                
                

            
                Many of these hospital closures have occurred in areas with significant Hispanic, African American and other minority populations—constituencies with which the GOP should be working to improve, rather than degrade, its standing.                
                

            
                It should be obvious that attacking an effective, revenue-neutral program that helps patients in need receive vital medications is just not the best way to address the many issues facing American families when it comes to health care.                
                

            
                Now more than ever, the American people need effective leadership to help fix our broken healthcare system and the many problems that Obamacare has exacerbated. Republicans should be focused on solving the problems Obamacare created or worsened and ensuring that the safety net serves its intended purpose: as a hand up, not a handout, for those who need it most.

Rutgers rage against Rice -- why do liberals have so much hate for black conservatives?,"Now Playing                            Rutgers protests Condoleezza Rice as graduation speaker

                That crazy thinking comes from the New Brunswick Faculty Council of Rutgers University. They voted last week to ask university leadership to cancel Rice’s invitation to be this year’s Commencement Speaker and receive an honorary degree.

                Rice holds a Ph.D. in political science. She has taught college for decades. She was Provost of Stanford University. She worked her way up from a working-class family in the segregated South to the highest echelon of world power and politics.                
                

            
                But according to the Rutgers faculty council, all of that is negated by her service in President George W. Bush’s administration.                
                

            
                They cited her roles in pushing the false claim of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They also point to her support for using enhanced interrogation techniques to get information from terror suspects.                
                

            
                The facts are right. The conclusion is wrong.                
                

            
                I, too, disagreed with many of the policies Rice faithfully supported as a member of the Bush administration. But only partisan hatred can blind the faculty to her extraordinary level of accomplishment for herself and her country.                
                

            
                Rice is smart, disciplined, hard-working and the model of an inspiring modern American. She personifies the American Dream. She is living inspiration for a young person trying to accomplish great work no matter what the barriers. And in Rice’s generation there were some serious barriers starting with her race and gender.                
                

            
                That is why New Jersey Republican State Assemblywoman Mary Pat Angelini called the Rutgers faculty’s wrongheaded decision ""appalling and an embarrassment to our state.""                
                

            
                ""This is nothing more than a political firestorm fueled by their hatred of an opposing ideology, and President George W. Bush in particular. Dr. Rice and the people of New Jersey deserve better,"" Angelini said.                
                

            
                There is an added element at play here. There is a disgraceful double standard amongst liberals, particularly those in academia, in the hatred they direct at black conservatives.                
                

            
                We saw this last April when the conservative neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson was forced to step down as a Commencement Speaker for Johns Hopkins University (where he ably served as the head of pediatric neurosurgery).                
                

            
                Liberals on the Hopkins campus mobilized against Carson because he criticized President Obama’s health care reform law and said that he opposed gay marriage.                
                

            
                I am not a conservative but I have spoken out for years against the staggering amount blind hatred directed at black conservatives by liberals.                
                

            
                Liberals are shockingly quick to demean and dismiss brilliant black people like Rice, Carson, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Professor Walter E. Williams and economist Thomas Sowell because they don’t fit into the role they have carved out for a black person in America.                
                

            
                Black Americans must be obedient liberals on all things or risk being called a race traitor or an Uncle Tom.                
                

            
                I’ve experienced some of this vitriol firsthand when I have veered by liberal orthodoxy. I wrote about it in my book “Muzzled – the Assault on Honest Debate.”                
                

            
                This shunning of Rice is especially troubling coming from a great American university. This is the place where debate and dissenting views are to be valued as sacred.                
                

            
                Rutgers’s own university mission statement says that one of its goals is to produce students who perform “public service in support of the needs of the citizens of the state and its local, county, and state governments.”                
                

            
                How is the public served by muzzling one of the most thoughtful, accomplished and respected political voices of her time just because she happens to be a Republican?                
                

            
                Doe the Rutgers University faculty really have so little faith in the students they are about to graduate that they think are incapable of hearing opposing views and making up their own minds?                
                

            
                Before her commencement speech, I would like to see any of one of the members of faculty council debate Secretary Rice on foreign policy and then let their students see how well their professors’ critique holds up.                
                

            
                Hell, how about we invite the entire faculty council to take their best shot at Secretary Rice in a debate.                
                

            
                Rice is the most famous Republican woman politician in the country. She gave the best speech of the 2012 Republican National Convention and, despite her lack of interest in political office, still gets mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2016.                
                

            
                If she is truly on the fence about a White House run, I would suggest she go for it if for no other reason than to rub it in the faces of these pompous jackass professors.                
                

            
                Of course that is not the only reason she should run, but it sure would be a delightful bonus.

The tax reform flip-flop Trump desperately needs to make,"Now Playing                            Where the Trump administration stands on health care                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Trump and the Republican Congressional leadership are following the lead of their rank and file. They are making their first priority the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare. That is a mistake. Health care reform is complicated. Arriving at a replacement plan will not happen quickly or easily.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Meanwhile, the Trump administration is beginning at a time when fourth quarter 2016 GDP growth, despite predictions of a robust outcome, came in at a tepid 1.9 percent. If the economy over the next nine months weakens significantly, be assured replacing Obamacare with a new plan supported by 60 senators, including eight Democrats, will be even more difficult.                
                

            
                Under the current proposed legislative agenda, Congress will not be able to take up the issue of tax reform until members of Congress get a firm picture of a replacement health care plan. That plan, which cannot be passed under the 51-vote majority reconciliation vehicle, but instead will require 60 votes, could take longer than expected to develop. During the next several months, the Senate will also be tied up in debate over the President’s Supreme Court nominee. Usually that process takes several months of debate and backroom maneuvering before a candidate is confirmed. The Senate becomes bogged down.                
                

            
                The point here is that financial markets are assuming that Congress will easily enact a tax reform package, including the immediate expensing for tax purposes of all capital investment and some form of border adjustment tax, by late summer at the latest.                 
                

            
                The prospect for tax reform is one reason the U.S. stock market has surged since the election. The more that ObamaCare replacement and the Supreme Court debate drag on through the rest of this year, the greater the chance that markets conclude that despite the Republican majorities and a Republican White House, legislative stalemate will continue well into 2018 if not longer.                
                

            
                For the GOP, the smarter strategy would be to immediately push tax reform under the first budget reconciliation vehicle. No, tax reform won’t be easy either. But the Democrats have far more emotional attachment to ObamaCare and the chances of outright partisan warfare over tax reform are relatively small.                 
                

            
                True, there will be opposition to the border adjustment tax, particularly from retailers. And those who suggest that the tax reform package not include individual tax reform are misreading the situation. Today 80 percent of businesses are so-called “pass-through” entities that are exempt from the corporate tax system. Any tax reform would have to include these smaller “corporate” entities -- i.e. it would have to include reform of the individual tax code in addition to the corporate tax code.                
                

            
                Capitol Hill moves at a snail’s pace. In the successful 1986 tax reform effort, legislators spent several years prior to enactment ironing out difficulties over thorny issues. Today’s tax reform will entail the same process of negotiations, albeit compressed timewise. The chances, nevertheless, that Congressional Republicans, with some Senate Democratic help, come together with 51 votes by the August 2017 Congressional recess and enact a package are hardly certain. But they are a lot better than the chances that Obamacare is passed through the Senate easily with 60 votes by that time.                
                

            
                The stakes for financial markets are high. If there is a chance tax reform and expensing are not be enacted until some unspecified time in the future, how does a company make a decision on new capital investment? Hold off investing this year in anticipation of much more favorable tax treatment in the future? But such delay could come at a cost to the economy and equity market. Under a border adjustment tax, exports would not be taxed. Should a corporation hold up on its exports until some unspecified future date to achieve tax savings? But such a delay would increase the trade deficit and harm the economy.                
                

            
                For Trump and the Republicans, the money play is to build a more robust economy quickly. With the credibility of such an achievement, ObamaCare, by then hanging by a thread, will become the responsibility of both parties in Congress. The program, even before enactment of a replacement, will likely have died its own death.                 
                

            
                For the first time in decades, both parties in this crisis environment will have to come together in agreement on something they hate -- a bipartisan solution.

                Living as an undocumented immigrant in the United States can be very difficult. Struggling as a sick, injured, or chronically ill immigrant can mean days, weeks, or even months of discomfort, with a visit to the emergency room usually the most affordable remedy.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                By act of living here illegally, these immigrants have very limited options for health care. All human beings deserve at least a basic level of medical care —to prevent loss of life, deliver a baby, etc.— but does that mean that taxpayers should foot the bill for more extensive care for anyone who manages to cross our borders and establish illegal residence in the US without detection?                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            We should focus more on sending a strong message to potential immigrants that legal access to government-funded health care should not be an expectation upon arrival in the United States.

                In March 2013, the California Endowment, a private foundation that advocates for affordable healthcare, launched a TV ad in which several undocumented immigrants explain to the viewer:                
                

            
                “I’m undocumented…We work hard and we’re strong, but everyone gets sick sometimes. Yet many of us don’t have health care. We cannot get health insurance. Now our country has spoken, saying that everyone should have affordable health care. Does that mean ‘everyone’ everyone? I dream that ‘everyone’ includes all of us.”                
                

            
                It’s unfortunate that part of that ad is untrue. While undocumented immigrants have traditionally had few choices for obtaining health care in the U.S., they can get it legally by purchasing private health insurance, paying out-of-pocket to visit an urgent care or community clinic for routine care or non-life threatening illnesses, or visiting an emergency room.                
                

            
                Urgent care and community clinics have been a primary health care option for undocumented immigrants and many uninsured U.S. citizens for quite some time. While visits aren’t exactly cheap, they’re preferred for low-income families who are generally healthy and can set some money aside for illnesses that require prescription medications, casts for minor bone fractures, etc.                 
                

            
                Controversy already exists over the use of emergency rooms for medical care by undocumented immigrants because they know they’ll receive care regardless of their ability to pay for it —which they commonly don’t. Funding for those visits currently comes from federal, state and local taxes, and hospitals in certain cities with high immigrant populations have an expectation for the flow of these patients.                
                

            
                But now that the Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare) is set to go into effect in 2014, the public cry from immigrant advocacy groups is growing to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for health care coverage under the Act. Section 1312 (f)(3) of the law: “Access limited to lawful residents. If an individual is not…a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States, the individual shall not be treated as a qualified individual and may not be covered under a qualified health plan...”                 
                

            
                Under President Obama’s current health care reform plan, undocumented immigrants will have to wait eight years before becoming eligible for public health care benefits, and ten years under a Congressional plan.                
                

            
                We’re in a time when the need for immigration reform has never been more real and our country and government never more ready. However, we’re also in the time of sequestration cuts, shrinking budgets, smaller incomes and higher taxes. Have we created the expectation among undocumented immigrants that by virtue of simply living in the U.S. they should have access to the same government benefits as legal residents, despite the fact that many of them don’t pay the taxes that fund those programs?                
                

            
                Obamacare isn’t free, and undocumented immigrants meeting a certain income threshold would have to pay premiums for any part of the plan they’re eligible for. However, currently the law provides federal subsidies for low-income families applying for public health insurance. According to a 2012 study by the Washington-based Urban Institute, undocumented immigrants —many of whom would require a federal subsidy— will make up the nation’s second-largest population of uninsured, or about 25 percent. All those subsidies would come from U.S. taxpayer pockets.                
                

            
                This isn’t about being anti-immigrant; it’s about following the rules, and not being rewarded for breaking them. My family emigrated from Cuba to the U.S. 50 years ago with nothing but the clothes on their backs, and no expectations or demands of the U.S. government. They worked very hard, followed the rules, and eventually became U.S. citizens. It’s hard for them and other immigrant families like them to watch millions of people who knowingly broke the rules demand equal footing just because they didn’t get caught coming here.                
                

            
                There’s no question that the current health care situation in the U.S. isn’t ideal for undocumented immigrants, but it’s not supposed to be. It’s already difficult enough to make routine health care accessible and manageable for U.S. citizens and legal residents, who must take priority over those living here illegally.                 
                

            
                Instead of relying on immigration reform to find a way to pay for undocumented immigrants’ health care with tax dollars, we should focus more on sending a strong message to potential immigrants that legal access to government-funded health care should not be an expectation upon arrival in the United States.

Exposing the world's great lie about ObamaCare and socialized medicine,"Now Playing                            Health care overhaul becomes reality                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                In health care, 2013 was a year of great irony. In the United States, the Obama administration bullheadedly forged ahead in advancing the most controversial and expensive law in recent memory, the deceptively named Affordable Care Act.

                The law, opposed by a clear and consistent majority of citizens, immediately caused millions of Americans to lose their health insurance along with their choice of doctor and hospital, and millions more to pay far higher insurance premiums.                
                

            
                While the focus has been on the embarrassing roll-out that, at a minimum, demonstrated both the incompetence and the poor judgment of this administration, the true harm of this law is still to come as new government authority over U.S. health care dramatically increases.                
                

            
                Concurrently, Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), the paradigm of government-controlled health care, turned 65 years old in 2013 and officially entered senior citizenship.                
                

            
                The NHS received its review by the British press this past year on an almost daily basis.

                Headlines blared across the UK, endlessly documenting scandalous patient care, shameful waiting lists, catastrophic hospital practices, and financial debacle.                
                

            
                Directly undermining those who advocate for an even stronger role for government in U.S. health care, the British press has instead been documenting the disgraceful state of the NHS.                
                

            
                Despite what Americans are led to believe about nationalized health systems, including the claims that everyone is insured and care is free under such systems, the facts about what’s really important in health care --- actual medical care access and quality -- showed the harmful impact of government control on health care.                
                

            
                One critical distinction generally lost amid the naïve but passionate backers of nationalized insurance is the difference between being insured and having access to care.                
                

            
                Despite the chest-thumping that everyone is insured, U.K. citizens relying on the NHS experience unconscionable problems with access to care, problems not even remotely found in the U.S.                
                

            
                How poor is access to care in socialized systems like the NHS? Access problems are so widespread that the government was compelled to issue England’s 2010 “NHS Constitution” in which it was declared that no patient should wait beyond 18 weeks for treatment.                
                

            
                It is noteworthy enough that the UK government felt so much pressure from the systemic failures of its NHS that they were forced to issue “rights” to patients about receiving medical care.                
                

            
                But should it not bring chills that the government of free people, in the 21st century, had the authority to define those rights about seeking and receiving personal medical care? And even more Kafkaesque is the government’s boldness to define lengthy target times and then to claim that standards have been met. Indeed, designed to propagate the illusion of meeting quality standards, the government decreed that targets were met, even if patients waited a full four months after the diagnosis was made for treatment to begin.                
                

            
                What is the current status of access to care, now that the rights of NHS patients to medical care were enumerated?                
                

            
                At the end of June, the number of people waiting in England to start NHS treatment was 240,000 higher than the same time last year.                
                

            
                NHS England figures for July showed that 508,555 people in London alone were waiting for operations or other treatment to begin — the highest total for at least five years.                
                

            
                Almost 60,000 more patients were waiting for treatment at the capital’s 34 NHS hospitals than one year ago. According to NHS data released in August, hospital waiting lists soared to a five-year high, with almost 2.9 million patients with a known diagnosis in the queue for treatment.                
                

            
                In Wales, the number of patients waiting more than nine months for hospital treatment in November had more than doubled in six months. The Welsh government also reported their NHS is still failing to treat 8 to 13% of the most urgent cancer cases within 62 days – two full months after diagnosis.                
                

            
                Even given a laughably long leash of an 18 week standard, the number of patients not being treated within the target of 18 weeks soared to 39,145 — up 16 per cent on the previous month -- in London alone.                
                

            
                The BBC discovered even more scandalous news back in February --  many patients initially assessed as needing surgery were subsequently re-categorized by the hospital so that they could be removed from waiting lists to distort the already unconscionable delays.                
                

            
                Royal College of Surgeons President Norman Williams, calling this “outrageous,” publicly charged that hospitals are cutting their waiting lists by artificially raising thresholds.                
                

            
                Though long proven by facts documented by the UK government and in scientific journals, these shocking waits for care, whether for specialist appointments, heart surgery, stroke treatment, diagnostic scans, or cancer care go virtually unreported by the U.S. media.                
                

            
                Ironically, U.S. media outrage was widespread when time to appointment for Americans averaged 20.5 days for five specialties in 2009. Escaping American media coverage was that those requests were for healthy check-ups in almost all cases, by definition the lowest medical priority.                
                

            
                It remains unreported that the U.S. wait for routine check-ups was significantly less than for sick Brits needing heart surgery (57 days), or Canadians with “probable cancer” of the gastrointestinal tract (26 days) or proven GI bleeding (71 days).                
                

            
                Even for purely elective routine physicals, U.S. waits are shorter than for seriously ill patients in countries with nationalized insurance.                
                

            
                The disgrace of nationalized insurance systems extends far beyond limited access to care.                
                

            
                Comparing data for cancer, heart disease, and stroke, the most common sources of serious illness and death in the U.S. and Europe, and the diseases that generate the highest medical expenditures, we see the overt failure of the NHS and its socialist relatives compared to the U.S. And the same bottom line is true for the most important chronic diseases that portend long term morbidity and mortality, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol.                
                

            
                All have better access to care and better treatment results in the U.S. than in the U.K., proven by studies in the world’s leading medical journals.                
                

            
                Adding to those undeniable facts is a long list of inexcusable scandals in NHS hospitals that were repeatedly discovered, investigated, and catalogued with promises of change this past year.                  
                

            
                These outrages were epitomized in 2013 by the Staffordshire Trust debacle, where between 400 and 1,200 neglected and abused patients died in squalid and degrading circumstances, where patients were left so thirsty that drinking from the pots of watered plants was necessary.                
                

            
                Although unreported here in the U.S., the 2013 Francis report about Staffordshire NHS hospital, containing more than one million pages and 64,000 documents, and costing British taxpayers about $20 million, caused outrage even for those wedded to government-controlled health care.                
                

            
                While forcing the resignation of the NHS chief, the report more importantly officially called out the insidious negative culture in the NHS, involving a tolerance of unacceptably poor standards and patient neglect , a preoccupation with cost-cutting, targets and processes while losing sight of its fundamental responsibility to provide safe patient care.                
                

            
                Yet, the greatest deception of all about NHS-style socialized medicine, the silly canard that it provides “free” health care for everyone, was visible for anyone interested in facts in 2013.                
                

            
                The cost to British patients and taxpayers for their dismally performing NHS has been enormous and has increased by 94 per cent in real terms between 1999-2000 and 2009-2010. And even in the face of such outrageous money-wasting as reported in September that millions of non-existent “ghost” patients were registered at NHS surgeries costing taxpayers £750 million over five years, Secretary of State for                
                

            
                Health Jeremy Hunt intransigently argued against any restraints on the 2014 NHS budget of £114 billion ($175 billion), despite its shameful performance and lack of accountability.                
                

            
                And that cost still does not prevent a growing number of British taxpayers from looking elsewhere for medical care. About six million Brits now buy private health insurance, including almost two-thirds of Brits earning more than $78,700.                
                

            
                According to The Telegraph, the number of people paying for their own private care is up 20 percent year-to-year, with about 250,000 now choosing to pay for private treatment out-of-pocket each year.                
                

            
                Isn’t it notable that more than 50,000 Britons travel out of the country per year and spend £161 million to receive medical care due to lack of access, even though they are already paying for their NHS insurance?                
                

            
                Despite all of these realities, just as in America, many in positions of power refuse to accept the facts and continue to deceive the public.                
                

            
                Even the hard-hitting 2013 Staffordshire report still insisted near the top of its list of summary points that “the NHS is a service of which the country can be justly proud, offering as it does universal access to free medical care, often of the highest order.”                  
                

            
                In a truly offensive effort to further manipulate the public about their failing system of socialized medicine, the NHS in London separately spent even more taxpayer money -- almost £13 million, or about $20 million -- on public relations in the last three years, as reported by the BBC.                
                

            
                Eerily echoing that disgraceful waste of hard-earned taxpayer money, our own Obama administration will spend about $684 million, as cited by the Associated Press, mainly on a massive campaign to convince young people to sign up for ObamaCare exchanges and purchase unnecessarily bloated, highly expensive insurance they don’t need or want.                
                

            
                Finally, the system often heralded as the model for US health care reform, offers access and quality of care so poor that Britain is now experiencing a serious brain drain of their young doctors.                
                

            
                The NHS has become hugely reliant on doctors trained outside the UK. An estimated 94,833 of the 259,719 doctors of all doctors registered with the General Medical Council, 36.5% of the total, are from foreign medical schools. And what is the solution to the disastrous waiting lists and disgraceful care in the NHS in the face of a considerable outflow of UK medical professionals?                
                

            
                The U.K. government is now considering sub-contracting operations to private firms from other countries.                
                

            
                Is anyone in the U.S. government watching this socialized medicine debacle unfold?                
                

            
                Yet, the stubborn pursuit of an overtly failed system like the NHS, where government controls medical care, is the model for ObamaCare, so the inexorable progression towards what we see in the U.K. should be in the minds of American voters as more components of the law unfold in 2014.                
                

            
                Ultimately, the only way out is for taxpayers and all U.S. citizens who care about choice, access, and quality of health care to make their voices heard.                
                

            
                Thankfully, another election is approaching.

              On June 27, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, urging him and the other Republicans in the Senate to abandon their plans to replace ObamaCare with what Paul believes—and rightly so—is a model too similar to the one created by the Affordable Care Act. Among the specific provisions Paul cites are the Senate leadership’s plan to offer millions of Americans federal tax credits and provide insurance companies with $136 billion to prop up the health insurance marketplace.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While those and many of Paul’s other points are worthy of consideration, there is one part of Paul’s health care reform wish list that is particularly important and worthy of significant attention: his call for “association health plans.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As Paul explains in his letter, “While I appreciate the inclusion of Small Business Health Plans in the BCRA, I believe improvements could be made to expand upon this provision to allow for greater freedom for individuals and small businesses to pool together for the purpose of obtaining health insurance coverage.”
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Under the BCRA, self-employed people could participate in small business health insurance plans, but Paul wants “the language [to] be changed to allow any individual, including self-employed individuals, to form associations for the purpose of purchasing group health insurance.”
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            While those and many of Paul’s other points are worthy of consideration, there is one part of Paul’s health care reform wish list that is particularly important and worthy of significant attention: his call for “association health plans.”
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              This might sound like a relatively unimportant bit of policy minutiae for those of you who aren’t interested in health care reform, but it most certainly is not. This one, largely overlooked policy addition has the potential to radically transform the health care market for the better and solve many of the problems ObamaCare attempted, but failed, to address—as well as those problems ObamaCare created.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              One of the greatest challenges facing policymakers on the issue of health care is determining how to ensure all people, including people who have pre-existing conditions, can have access to high-quality, affordable health insurance. The Affordable Care Act attempted to solve this problem by dramatically restructuring the health insurance market, creating substantial government subsidies and imposing numerous costly mandates and pre-existing conditions requirements on health insurers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              “If the health insurance companies aren’t going to provide fair prices to people with pre-existing conditions, we’re going to make them,” the ObamaCare creators apparently thought. However, once you stop requiring people to have health insurance before they get sick, you cease to have a true insurance system.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Imagine for just a moment what the car insurance market would look like if uninsured drivers could smash into other people’s cars and property and then be able to call an insurer and force them to cover the accident. The price of everyone’s car insurance would skyrocket, because the car insurance companies would be required to cover expensive accidents caused by irresponsible drivers that haven’t been paying into the system. That’s essentially what has happened to the health insurance market under ObamaCare.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The flip side of that coin is under the old model, sick patients who did not have health insurance through no fault of their own couldn’t get the insurance coverage they needed at prices they could afford.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Paul’s proposal to “allow any individual, including self-employed individuals, to form associations for the purpose of purchasing group health insurance” would go a long way toward solving this policy dilemma. If people could form their own associations and purchase health insurance as a group, the pre-existing conditions problem would mostly go away, because insurers would negotiate rates with the group knowing that some people might join over time with pre-existing conditions. The costs are built into the initial price negotiated and spread out amongst all those in the association. This is exactly how many employer-sponsored health insurance plans work today.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Church groups, advocacy organizations, charities, golf clubs, and virtually any other group of people could theoretically negotiate an association health plan under Paul’s provision, allowing like-minded people to take care of each other and providing those being insured with greater negotiating power.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Also worth noting is that if more people purchase insurance plans through non-employer private associations, it would help resolve the many issues that arise when people lose their jobs, providing greater health insurance stability.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Paul, himself a physician, understands that to solve the United States’ health care problems, we need innovative solutions like his proposal to expand association health plans. What we absolutely don’t need, however, is tweaks to a model that has long failed to provide affordable, quality health insurance coverage to all Americans.

"After Supporting ObamaCare, Has the American Medical Association Lost Its Way?","American Medical Association (AMA) president Cecil Wilson did a splendid job of revealing the true colors of the organization in his statements made at the recent House of Delegates meeting in Chicago.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                He stated that “no group other than the AMA speaks for doctors.” He also said that it is “shameful for doctors to oppose ObamaCare and to disagree with the AMA endorsement of it.                 
                

            
                His arrogance is stunning and shows how far out of touch the AMA is with the majority of doctors.                 
                

            
                Not surprisingly, their membership continues to dwindle and is down 12,000 paying members just this past year. Less than 17% of practicing physicians in America belong to the AMA, yet a fraction of these doctors agree with the policies and positions that come from the leadership of the organization.

During 2009, at the height of the health care reform debate, all of the stakeholders came to Washington with strong lobbying efforts on behalf of their constituents. All, that is, except for doctors.                 
                

            
                The American Hospital Association (AHA), America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), and Big Pharma all received concessions in exchange for their support of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).                 
                

            
                This was not the case with the “true voice of doctors” -- the AMA. They failed miserably when they had an opportunity to negotiate for issues important to doctors such as a permanent end to the Medicare SGR (“doc fix”) and tort reform.                 
                

            
                Instead, the AMA was a strong advocate for ObamaCare and got nothing in return for their constituents. In fact, a strong case can be made that the AMA was an accomplice to the successful passage of this law, because without their backing, the bill may have been in jeopardy. The question is: why did this happen?

Many people think that the AMA miscalculated, while others believe that they were just inept and simply outfoxed by clever politicians.                 
                

            
                Then there are some who question whether there may be a connection with the preservation of their government sanctioned monopoly over medical coding -- a system that all doctors and hospitals must use in order to get paid. This is a huge income stream for the organization --over $80 million annually--and allows it to stay afloat and financially strong at a time when revenue from paying members is dwindling.                 
                

            
                Looking for other income sources in lieu of membership dues, the AMA received an additional $47 million in 2009 by selling membership data to drug companies. This may be why they remained eerily silent when the prescription drug data mining case was heard by the US Supreme Court in May.

Another item that went mostly unnoticed was the recent appointment of James Madera as the CEO of the AMA. It is noteworthy that Dr. Madera has ties to the Obama White House, having worked with First Lady Michelle Obama and top presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett when he was CEO at the University of Chicago Medical Center and they were both on the board.                 
                

            
                He resigned his position amid controversy over a plan to redirect patients from the University to community hospitals -- a plan that was criticized by doctors at the hospital as well as the university president.                 
                

            
                More importantly regarding Dr. Madera, is the fact that he has been a lifelong academician who has more in common with hospitals than with doctors. In fact, the AHA praised his selection, and its spokesman, CEO Rich Umbdenstock thought that Dr. Madera would “provide the insight needed as the healthcare field continues to align and integrate.                 
                

            
                At a time when doctors are increasingly distrustful of the Obama administration and of hospitals with the prospect of ACOs (accountable care organizations) looming large, the AMA has selected as their CEO a man who has close ties to both groups -- not reassuring for doctors.

There are many doctors who had hoped that the 2011 AMA House of Delegates meeting would be an opportunity to reclaim the organization; to get them to repudiate ObamaCare. Instead, they resoundingly reaffirmed their support of it- specifically the individual mandate, which may yet be determined to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

Unfortunately, the AMA is too far gone to reclaim it. At this point, the patient (the AMA) is “terminal.”                 
                

            
                The shame lies not with doctors who disagree with the “official” positions that this organization takes, as Dr. Wilson would have people believe, but with him for having the temerity to deny the basic right of dissent to members of his profession who disagree with him and who believe that the AMA has betrayed doctors and patients.

                One of the reasons our political structure has become dysfunctional no matter which party is in power is that too many of us are living in the moment. The closest we get to history is the instant replay.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is as if there is nothing the past can teach us; no wisdom that might be culled from those who have gone before. We buy guidebooks, or go online for information about countries or cities we plan to visit, trusting those who have been there to tell us the best places to stay, see and eat. When it comes to more momentous things, like health care, too many people believe government does best, regardless of historical and even contemporary evidence to the contrary.                
                

            
                The well-known quote ""That government is best which governs least,"" often attributed to Henry David Thoreau, has been supplanted in our day by the notion that government is my keeper, I shall not want.                
                

            
                All of the promises about health care ""reform"" are proving dubious at best. The move from insurance exchanges to single payer to the eventual takeover of the health care industry will happen incrementally, but inevitably, unless Republicans win back control of government and have the courage to repeal and replace ObamaCare with something better.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                What should awaken apathetic Americans is a story in last week's The New York Times headlined, ""Cost of Treatment May Influence Doctors."" The story said some of the country's largest medical groups are now suggesting that physicians consider cost when treating patients. The Times says a subtle shift is taking place within medicine as ""doctors are starting to redefine their roles, from being concerned exclusively about individual patients to exerting influence on how health care dollars are spent.""                
                

            
                In other words, are you ""worth"" being treated for cancer or other illnesses that can cost a lot of money? When government pressures health care providers to accept a utilitarian view of human life, it is a short step to government deciding whose life is worth living and whose is not.                
                

            
                When the dollar becomes almighty, the Almighty who creates life takes a backseat.                
                

            
                Promises that the misnamed Affordable Care Act would reduce costs are already being proved wrong. Health care spending is surging, according to another New York Times story. President Obama promised it would decline. We heard similar promises 50 years ago when Medicare was introduced. Politicians then promised costs would never exceed a certain level, which they did in very short order.                
                

            
                Critics of ObamaCare say one of its objectives is to put insurance companies out of business. The UnitedHealth Group is one of the nation's largest. It recently reported lower earnings and said the health care law is partially responsible.                
                

            
                The ""sound of inevitability,"" to quote from the film ""The Matrix,"" can be heard across the Atlantic. The National Health Service (NHS) continues to sputter as its experiment in socialized medicine produces horror stories that could be replicated in the United States if government is ever allowed to control not only insurance, but treatment.                
                

            
                A UK Daily Mail story tells of a great-grandmother who died in agony at Manchester Royal Infirmary. She suffered from a perforated bowel and while she screamed in pain for help she was told a nearby doctor, who was playing on a computer, ""wasn't on duty."" Stories of neglect, long waits for treatment, insensitivity toward patients and unusual numbers of deaths in some UK hospitals are no longer exceptions, but are increasingly common.                
                

            
                Why do so many have faith in government when government has a track record of failure and incompetence in the many tasks it undertakes? How can government be expected to miraculously acquire competence when it comes to health care?                
                

            
                Real faith is based on something substantive, not false hope. Government is a false god that history proves can't deliver on most of its promises.

5 reasons ObamaCare is already good for you,"This week, the nine Justices of the Supreme Court have been listening to oral arguments about the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                According to polls, 56% of Americans favor repealing the health care reform law. Then again, a decision on fundamental rights and constitutionality should not be a popularity contest. What’s more, according another poll, 1 in 7 Americans believes the Supreme Court has already repealed the Affordable Care Act. So much for polling.                 
                

            
                How’s about, instead, we look at some facts:

1. Millions of Americans have already benefited from ObamaCare

In 2011, an estimated 86 million Americans used provisions in the Affordable Care Act to get preventative care through their insurance plans, care that insurance companies previously subjected to co-pays or deductibles but now must provide for free. Over 2.5 million seniors have saved an estimated $1.5 billion thanks to prescription drug discounts included in health care reform.                 
                

            
                At least 2.5 million young people now can stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26. And 4 million small businesses can now claim a tax deduction for providing health insurance to their employees, which so far over a quarter-million small businesses have claimed, providing insurance for 2 million workers.

2. The law won’t fully take effect until 2014

It’s amazing all the pre-emptive attacks on a law that, for the most part, hasn’t gone into effect yet. You can check out this timeline of the various provisions of the Affordable Care Act and when they will take effect.                 
                

            
                The controversial “individual mandate” at the center of the Supreme Court arguments this week doesn’t kick in until 2014. What this means is that the cost containment provisions in the Affordable Care Act haven’t gone into effect yet either, and meanwhile critics are attacking the law based largely on hypothetical future predictions.                 
                

            
                In fact, on Monday, the Supreme Court considered whether interest groups or individuals can file suit against a provision in the law that hasn’t even been enforced yet.                
                

            
                3. The individual mandate was originally a Republican idea.

Recently, President Obama’s senior adviser David Plouffe called Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney “the godfather of the individual mandate.” At a GOP primary debate in 2011, Romney said, “We got the idea of an individual mandate…from [Newt Gingrich], and [Newt] got it from the Heritage Foundation.”                 
                

            
                In fact, the idea of requiring businesses or individuals to provide and pay for health insurance traces at least as far back as Richard Nixon, who in 1974 proposed a mandate that “every employer would be required to offer all full-time employees the Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan,” the insurance plan Nixon was pushing.                 
                

            
                In 1989, Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundation shifted the conservative frame from an employer mandate to an individual mandate, writing:                
                

            
                If a man is struck down by a heart attack in the street, Americans will care for him whether or not he has insurance. If we find that he has spent his money on other things rather than insurance, we may be angry but we will not deny him services—even if that means more prudent citizens end up paying the tab…. A mandate on households certainly would force those with adequate means to obtain insurance protection, which would end the problem of middle-class “free riders” on society’s sense of obligation.                
                

            
                Incidentally, Butler has recently tried to renounce his invention of the individual mandate, but it appears to me that his reasoning reads something like, “I was for it when it was a Republican idea and am against it now that Democrats embraced it.”                
                

            
                4. The Congressional Budget Office recently cut health care reform’s cost estimates.

Conservatives have relied on apples-to-oranges accounting gimmicks to suggest the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently doubled the cost estimates for the Affordable Care Act.                 
                

            
                In fact, the CBO adjusted its estimates to say the Affordable Care Act will cost less than originally projected. Moreover, the CBO has said that repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase the deficit by $210 billion.                
                

            
                5. Something had to be done about health care

The fact is, almost three-quarters of Americans saw health care reform as an urgent priority in the fall of 2009.                 
                

            
                President Obama had a plan.                 
                

            
                Republicans did not.                 
                

            
                Still today, the president is trying to adapt and confirm the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to meet the needs of all Americans while keeping costs down. Republicans are simply putting forward another budget that slashes Medicare and middle class benefits while giving more tax breaks to the rich.                 
                

            
                At the end of the day, while Americans are still on the fence about the Affordable Care Act as a blanket concept, when asked about particular remedies that the law includes, the public is overwhelmingly supportive.                 
                

            
                This suggests that the president has a messaging problem, not a policy problem --- whereas the Republicans simply lack any substantive alternative, let alone a popular one.                
                

            
                All of the above suggests that the current fight over health care reform has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act and everything to do with the president who signed it.                 
                

            
                Never mind the fact that the law already shows promising and valuable impact even before it’s fully in effect. Never mind the fact that cost estimates are dropping and, starting in 2014, the law will contain overall health care costs that are crippling our household budgets.                 
                

            
                Never mind the fact that the central component of the law was a Republican idea. Conservative ideologues are willing to sacrifice much-needed health care reform and the well-being of millions of Americans who don’t have health insurance or are being denied care because of pre-existing conditions, lifetime caps on spending or other injustices -- all for the sick goal of undermining President Obama.

Fortunately, about a third of the country -- moderate and swing voters -- haven’t made up their mind and are ready to listen to the president, who needs to a better job in the 2012 campaign of defining the benefits of his health care reform. But especially when faced with the alternative -- a Republcan Party increasingly concerned only with the health and well-being of the 1% -- voters will back the president and their own best interest to have health and prosperity for all Americans.

Economist: Trump says he wants real growth for America. Can he deliver?,"President Trump’s economic team paints a rosier picture of what his policies can accomplish than the economics profession is willing to endorse.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                Trump’s team is formulating budget and tax proposals that project 3 percent annual growth, while the number crunchers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate only 1.9 percent.
                
                


                
            
                How fast the economy can grow comes down to the simple sum of likely worker productivity and labor force growth. Since the financial crisis, productivity has advanced about 1 percent a year, compared to 2 percent in prior decades.
                
                


                
            
                Thanks to baby boomer retirements and a declining birth rate, the prime working age population — those aged 25 to 65 — is not likely to grow even 1 percent annually — even with well-conceived, needs-based immigration reforms and changes in entitlement programs that encourage more adults to work.
                
                


                
            
                The premise underlying Trump’s program — lower taxes, health care reform, deregulation, infrastructure spending and tougher trade policies to lower the import deficit — is to make the United States a more attractive location for investment and innovation than, for example, China or Mexico.
                
                


                
            
                There’s no doubt that cutting corporate and personal income taxes and spending more on roads and highways could give the economy a Keynesian jolt and raise growth above 3 percent for a few quarters. But Trump’s policy reforms are likely to be watered down by political infighting.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                The prospects that those proposals will carry long-term punch for productivity and growth are limited by congressional politics and, perhaps more fundamentally, by conditions limiting the efficacy of pushing up investment through tax cuts.
                
                


                
            
                As with health care, the GOP in Congress is sharply divided on tax reform. For example, should corporate reform tax imports to make the package revenue neutral, or should we accept a somewhat bigger federal deficit? Also, Trump and Speaker Ryan are unlikely to get much help from Democrats to forge a bipartisan majority.
                
                


                
            
                Similarly, using private money to improve roads and bridges has some potential, but many improvements will likely require unpopular new taxes and user fees. Trump’s promise to get tough on trade faces strong opposition even among skeptics inside his own White House.
                
                


                
            
                More importantly, though, many economists believe low labor productivity growth is baked into the cake. Led by Northwestern University Professor Robert Gordon, most hew to the notion that the faster pace of productivity growth accomplished during the American industrial era — roughly 1870 to 1970 — resulted from groundbreaking innovations like electricity, the interstate highway system and antibiotics. The effects of those innovations are not likely to be repeated.
                
                


                
            
                These days, they say, important new technologies — game machines and handheld devices that permit comparison shopping while roaming the aisles at Target — do more to entertain and enhance our leisure time than boost productivity.
                
                


                
            
                The problem is that economists are really good at explaining what just happened — in this case, the productivity slowdown of the last few decades — but are lousy at telling us much about the future.
                
                


                
            
                Our models look at recent trends, cast them in concrete and then extrapolate into the future. They can’t accurately predict GDP growth two or three quarters from now, never mind tell us much about how emerging innovations will change work and the broader contours of the economy one or several decades into the future.
                
                


                
            
                Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and robotics — from robots that perform routine tooth repairs for dentists to artificial intelligence programs that accelerate the work of automobile and fashion designers — have the potential to replace up to 90 percent of current job categories, or at least to make workers occupying most positions profoundly more efficient.
                
                


                
            
                In the decades ahead, machines that can feel and think — replacing the tactile advantages of the human hand and genuinely solving tough problems, as opposed to merely accelerating the searching and processing of information — will boost productivity in ways we can hardly fathom.
                
                


                
            
                Vision and imagination have a way of winning out over pessimism and ossified thinking. Perhaps it’s a good thing that the White House has only a thin representation of economists and other experts telling President Trump what can’t be achieved.
                
                


                
            
                Trump’s supporters keep talking about rekindling animal spirits, but perhaps they will fill America’s biggest deficit — the lack of confidence that vexing challenges can be turned to our advantage.

"Sex, Lies and Immigration -- The More GOP Candidates Talk, the More Out of Touch They Appear","President Obama should sleep well tonight. The more the Republican presidential candidates open their mouths at Thursday night's GOP presidential debate in Orlando, the more clear it is how out of touch they are with mainstream American voters. Tonight, there was no clear winner in the debate. The loser? Common sense and common decency. Here’s how I would sum it up:                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Sex                 
                

            
                Via a YouTube video, an active member of the United States military spoke about no longer having to hide his sexual orientation thanks to the lifting of ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell."" A sizeable portion of the live audience in Orlando, Florida could be heard booing -- booing an active service member bravely defending our country!                 
                

            
                Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum responded by demeaning this honorable American, saying that gays in the military shouldn’t get “special privilege”--  failing to acknowledge that ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" was actually special punishment.                 
                

            
                More than 8 in 10 Americans supported repealing the unfair restriction on gay men and women in the military. But Santorum offensively quipped that “sex has no place in the military” -- something that would come as quite a shock to heterosexuals in the armed forces, who are free to have whatever relationships they please. It was a shameful moment when an aspiring president failed to stand up for the most basic of human rights and some in the audience booed a member of our nation’s military.                
                

            
                Lies                
                

            
                There were too many to count.                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Romney, the president did not go on an “apology tour.”                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Perry, we do not have the highest corporate tax rate in the world -- in fact, we have one of the lowest.                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Johnson, our nation is not bankrupt .                 
                

            
                No, Mr. Cain, the health care reform law would in no way, shape or form ration your cancer care .                
                

            
                It’s one thing to make grand rhetorical statements to try and get attention in a crowded race. It’s another thing to flat out lie to the American people.

Immigrants                
                

            
                I love it when the Republican presidential candidates quote Ronald Reagan. After all, as conservative Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) recently put it, given the extremist influence of the Tea Party today, “Ronald Reagan would have a hard time getting elected as a Republican”.                 
                

            
                Reagan raised taxes 11 times, supported unions, bailed out Social Security -- and granted amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants.                 
                

            
                Perry, who like his doppelganger Bush is actually fairly pragmatic and humane when it comes to undocumented immigrants, was attacked for allowing kids who grew up their whole life in Texas to pay in-state tuition rates for state universities.

But during the immigrant bashing round of Thursday night's debate in Orlando (and for those of you thinking, “No, we’re just against illegal immigrants -- note the commercial that ran during one of the breaks, a conservative group advocating for a reduction in legal immigration to the United States), several candidates piled on suggesting that immigrants only come to America for the benefits -- not, er, jobs to feed their families -- and that we should stop giving immigrants even the most basic of benefits.                 
                

            
                I was waiting for another “let them die” moment, suggesting we should even deny undocumented immigrants emergency access to hospital emergency rooms.                 
                

            
                When Perry, the man who has executed 234 mostly guilty individuals, chirps up and accuses his compatriots of “not having a heart”, we should all take pause.                
                

            
                The good news is that the vast majority of Americans support the right of gay men and women to serve openly in the military and the vast majority of Americans support a path to citizenship for our nation’s undocumented immigrants.                 
                

            
                Hopefully the vast majority of Americans can see through the candidates’ lies as well.                 
                

            
                But unfortunately for our nation and our future, the leading candidates of a major political party are firmly out of touch with the majority of American people and reality.

"Chief Justice Roberts, please put off ObamaCare decision until 2013","Let’s be honest: The Supreme Court makes political decisions. To many, this statement is heresy. But that doesn’t make it any less true, as Professor Barry Freidman explains in his book ""The Will of the People: How Public Opinion Has Influenced the Supreme Court and Shaped the Meaning of the Constitution.""                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The two latest cases with historic, political overtones are officially referred to as case 11-393, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius and case 11-400, Florida v. The Department of HHS. These two case challenge the constitutionality of the Affordable Health Care Act, more commonly known as “ObamaCare.”                 
                

            
                Right now, the Supreme Court’s public image is at a worrisome level ; less than 30% of likely voters rating the institution excellent or good.                 
                

            
                The High Court last waded into such political thicket during a presidential campaign back in 1936. -- President Franklin Delano Roosevelt sought re-election while the justices of the Supreme Court legally gutted his famed New Deal.                 
                

            
                A recent Gallup poll found an astounding 72% of Americans believed the fundamental glue to the president’s health care reform – the individual mandate – is unconstitutional.

                Besides nearly all Republicans, many Democrats and independents are also opposed to the health care law. As legendary Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes warned in his classic book ""The Common Law,"" legal decisions defying such collective wisdom threaten respect for the law.                
                

            
                So we ask: would the Supreme Court best serve America by intentionally delaying any substantive decision about the health care law until after the 2012 presidential election?                 
                

            
                This judicial sleight of hand will not be necessary should the Justices rule that the 1867 Anti-Junction Act prevents any decision before the law is fully operative in 2015.                 
                

            
                But once Chief Justice Roberts determines this is not the majority view, then he owes the Court and the country a calculated political delaying tactic.                 
                

            
                This can be easily done by quietly rounding up the votes for additional hearings after the new Supreme Court term begins on October 1. There is already a precedent for such a move. -- Justice Felix Frankfurter used a similar tactic to help win a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954). And it would guarantee no decision prior to the 2012  presidential election in November.                
                

            
                The Court’s authority to rule on ObamaCare’s legality is itself a product of brilliant legal politics by Chief Justice John Marshall. The Constitution doesn’t explicitly give the Supremes power to overrule an act of Congress.                 
                

            
                When the famed case of Marbury vs. Madison (1803), reached the Supreme Court, populists aligned with President Jefferson believed Congress was superior to the Judiciary as elected lawmakers represented the people’s will.                 
                

            
                But conservative Federalists like Marshall feared Jeffersonian Democrats would abuse legislative power. They viewed the Judiciary as a co-equal check and balance. William Marbury had been appointed by Federalist President John Adams to a judicial post. But Jefferson had taken office before Marbury’s pro forma paperwork got inked. The Virginian refused to let Secretary of State James Madison sign it. The angry Federalist sued.                
                

            
                The political irony would have delighted even Machiavelli.                 
                

            
                If Jefferson’s constitutional interpretation was right – the Judiciary lacked the power to declare an act of Congress unconstitutional – then Marbury could get the Supreme Court to force the president to give him the job.                
                

            
                But if Marshall adopted the Federalist position – the Judiciary had the constitutional authority to declare federal legislation creating Marbury’s job unconstitutional – then his long-time Virginia rival would win. However, the price for defeating Marbury would be to establish the Court’s power to overrule Acts of Congress.                
                

            
                Marshall had the perfect political case to lose the battle and win the war. So he persuaded all the Justices to back Jefferson over Marbury, thus making it impossible for the president to oppose their decision!                
                

            
                Fast forward to today -- the ‘ObamaCare” case risks a bitter Supreme Court split.                 
                

            
                The dueling sides will accuse each other of shredding the Constitution. Democrats and Republicans are already gearing up for a ""scorched earth"" campaign fueled by cash unleashed by the Supreme Court with its 2010 decision in Citizens United vs the Federal Election.                 
                

            
                The Supremes need to step back. There is no pressing need for a quick decision. Let Americans first “have it out” in the presidential campaign. It is time to trust the people for a change.

Want to ditch ObamaCare? Let's copy Singapore's health care miracle,"(Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Give how badly we’ve managed to botch up health care here in the United States, you’d probably be surprised to find out that another country—Singapore—has used forgotten American ideas to build the world’s greatest healthcare system.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As the political debate over health care reform heats up again, it is important to understand both what Singapore has built as well as the fact that everything that it has accomplished has been shown to work just as well here in the United States, too.                
                

            
                Singapore is the only country in the world that can boast of being in the top five in infant mortality, life expectancy, and maternal mortality.  Better yet, when Business Week compared countries on 21 different healthcare metrics, Singapore stood out as the world’s healthiest country.                
                

            
                By contrast, the U.S. health care system delivers mediocre results while spending more than any other nation on health care. The United States ranks 41st in life expectancy, 55th in infant mortality, and 49th in maternal mortality while spending nearly 18 percent of GDP on health care.                 
                

            
                By contrast, other developed nations deliver much better results while spending between 9 and 12 percent of GDP.  So getting our 18 percent of GDP down to the typical 9 to 12 percent would be a major accomplishment.                
                

            
                But the fact remains that Singapore is managing to deliver the world’s very best health outcomes for just 4.7 percent of GDP—or less than half of what Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom are spending.                
                

            
                How does Singapore do it? By empowering consumers and fostering competition.                
                

            
                The most fundamental way to empower consumers is by providing real health security. So Singapore provides true universal access as well as coverage for preexisting conditions. Singapore then builds on that by making sure that everyone—rich and poor, young and old—has money to pay for access to the same doctors and the same facilities.                
                

            
                This is done by ensuring plentiful contributions into health savings accounts and by providing a high-deductible health insurance plan that people can actually afford—not only the premiums, but the deductibles and copays, too.                 
                

            
                Providing people with adequate health savings balances and universal high-deductible health insurance transforms people into empowered consumers. The government then provides them with price-comparison data as well as provider-performance data so people can comparison shop both on price and quality.  The result is the world’s most competitive healthcare market—one in which providers have to deliver on both quality and price if they are going to survive.                
                

            
                The results are startling. Major surgeries cost 62 to 92 percent less in Singapore. As just one example, a heart-bypass surgery that would cost $130,000 in the United States costs just $18,000 in Singapore. Overall, Singapore spends 72 percent less per person on health care than the United States and between 46 and 57 percent less than Canada, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom.                 
                

            
                If we could cut our health care spending down to Singapore’s level, we would have annual savings of about 12.2 percent of GDP, or about $2.1 trillion per year.                  
                

            
                That’s such a huge amount of money that we could balance the federal budget, bring Medicare and Medicaid into long-run actuarial balance, and still have over $1 trillion per year left over to spend on other crucial national priorities such as infrastructure, education, and national defense.                
                

            
                A key point is that everything that Singapore has accomplished has already been shown to work here in the United States.  Whole Foods Markets has a wildly popular Singapore-style health care plan that was approved by its unions.  And the State of Indiana proved that Singapore-style health insurance works for both middle-class government employees as well as indigent Medicaid recipients.                
                

            
                Local control also creates flexibility and strength in addition to slashing red tape and administrative costs. By empowering individuals to choose and by forcing providers to compete, the healthcare system becomes bottom-up rather than top-down.                   
                

            
                That bottom-up perspective is important for policymakers looking for solutions. The decentralization that comes from empowering individuals will allow our healthcare system to cope with the size and diversity of United States far better than the central planning and rigid rules embraced by our current system.                 
                

            
                We the People is the basis of our Constitution.  It should also be the basis for totally reforming our healthcare system. We can provide the highest quality, lowest-cost healthcare in the world if we only get out of our own way and trust ordinary Americans to make wise decisions for themselves and their families.

                Remember how President Obama and the Democrats who passed Obamacare were going to “get” the insurance companies? Rhetorically, Obama set out to target big insurance companies—making them the bad guy was central to selling Obamacare as a plan that would help middle and lower class families.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But one of the dirty little secrets of Obamacare is that the biggest insurance companies were willing allies in the fight to pass the law, knowing that they stood to add hundreds of thousands of new members to their networks. And they have. The central part of Obamacare, the individual mandate, may be the most disliked component among the American people, but it is precisely what guarantees insurers new customers.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Today 95 percent of Bayonne [Medical Center's] patients are covered by some type of insurance payment, a very high percentage compared to other urban hospitals.

                Of course, these new customers have brought with them profit growth for the insurance industry in leaps and bounds. In 2013, the value of the S&P health insurance index gained 43 percent. Major insurers have seen their revenues rise by billions every year since the passage of Obamacare.                
                

            
                And yet, this comes as middle class and working families continue to be squeezed by rising health care costs. As illustrated last week, “government data show that health care costs are the biggest driver of income inequality in America today.” Pay increases are being eaten up by rising healthcare costs, including higher insurance premiums, and the shrinking American middle class suffers.                
                

            
                Some in the insurance industry appear to not be content with the advantage that they won under Obamacare, which obscures prices for the average consumer/patient even more than before the law was passed. Insurance companies and providers are incentivized to use artificially high price points to start, and end up negotiating a “discounted” middle-ground.

                These pricing schemes just add to string of hits on middle and low income families. Providers who dare to look at better ways to implement sound business practices in order to remain operationally viable can find themselves under attack.                
                

            
                For example, one urban hospital in New Jersey, Bayonne Medical Center, has found itself in the crosshairs for seeking to negotiate a more sane pricing structure.                
                

            
                Policy expert Ryan Ellis provides his assessment:                
                

            
                Two recent screaming headlines from the U.K.’s Daily Mail (“That’s painful! New Jersey hospital charges man nearly $9,000 to treat a CUT on his middle finger”) and the New York Times (“New Jersey Hospital Has Highest Billing Rates in the Nation”) were clearly planted as a negotiating leverage tactic by Big Insurance. The hope is to cow providers into charging less in the fake first bill so that the “discount” results in lower payments to providers/bigger profits for insurance companies.                
                

            
                Not long ago, Bayonne Medical Center was on the verge of closing its doors after decades of financial struggle—no surprise when one considers just how much strain medical facilities face in underserved areas. In fact, Hudson County, where Bayonne is located, has the highest rate of uninsured, underinsured, and Medicaid patients in New Jersey.                
                

            
                Bayonne is now on more solid financial footing thanks to new investment, restructuring of management practices, and the negotiation of a more fair reimbursement plan with insurers. Bayonne reached contract agreements with all of the nearly all insurance providers, including the New Jersey’s largest. Today 95 percent of Bayonne's patients are covered by some type of insurance payment, a very high percentage compared to other urban hospitals.                 
                

            
                But as Ellis have points out, suddenly there appears to be a coordinated attack designed to pressure Bayonne into giving in to insurance providers with whom they have yet to reach a pricing agreement.                
                

            
                In the current health care environment in which working families are being subjected to strains on their budget and ultimately their well-being, it would seem that health care providers who operate in underserved communities, especially those that are efficient and price effective, could be held up as a model of success. Instead, they face sensationalist headlines designed to create pressure on them to succumb to pricing demands.                
                

            
                All of this just adds to the long list of reasons why the American people need health care reform that puts patients and families in charge of their health care, as opposed to politicians, bureaucrats, and third-party payers. The sooner that real health care reform is passes the better for all of us.

State of the Union 2015: Optimistic Obama out of touch with Americans,"Now Playing                            Obama: We need economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    









    
        
    

    

    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                The State of the Union speech is always optimistic. And it should be.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It’s a unique opportunity for the president to shape the narrative for the next year and his legacy.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            President Obama's speech was out of step with the wishes of the American people and the realities we are facing at home and abroad.
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                To this end, President Obama’s emphasis on the economy and our “shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production” is the obvious and clear place for him to start.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            President Obama's speech was out of step with the wishes of the American people and the realities we are facing at home and abroad.
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                But by focusing on his agenda exclusively and not a bipartisan agenda, Obama is ignoring the will of the American people who voted Republican in November. This is especially disappointing considering that he pledged in November to work with Congress and to, above all else, be responsive to the American public’s preferences.                
                

            
                In his own words, “the shadow of crisis has passed and the state of the union is strong.”                
                

            
                Amongst the areas that we are doing well, President Obama highlighted the fact that we are creating jobs at fastest pace since 1999, that the unemployment rate lower than before the crisis, more Americans are insured than ever before and that we are not dependent on foreign oil for the first time in 30 years.                
                

            
                If only the American people felt that way. The speech was out of step with the wishes of the American people and the realities we are facing at home and abroad.                
                

            
                New Rasmussen polling numbers show that 61% of voters believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction. So even though we have seen economic growth and an unemployment rate under 6% for months now – a lower rate than before the financial crisis – yet most Americans still feel squeezed, short on money and not optimistic about the future.                
                

            
                And they’re afraid. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris, on the heels of the hostage situation in Australia and the slew of ISIS beheadings, have rattled Americans – and for good reason.                
                

            
                Over 80% of the electorate believes that there will be a terrorist attack on American soil. And, unfortunately, in light of what we now have seen is possible in Western nations, it is my belief that they may not be wrong.                
                

            
                In light of this, the president’s claim that we are stopping ISIS’s advance is not only wrong in real terms, but shows an administration that is out of step with American sentiment.                
                

            
                I am not an advocate of another ground war. And I am sympathetic to those that are concerned that if we send troops back to the Middle East, we will end up with another drawn out conflict.                
                

            
                But there is no doubt in my mind – and in the minds of many military officials both serving and retired – that our approach isn’t working.                
                

            
                I wrote last week that it was my hope that the president would be specific and focused in this speech. And that it would be specifically focused on our plan to counteract the threat from radical Islam that is very real.                
                

            
                Needless to say, I didn’t get my wish.                
                

            
                Further, there was almost no talk of policy conciliation in President Obama’s speech, despite ample opportunity for areas of compromise including immigration reform, health care reform, debt, deficit and fiscal reform as well as tax policy and infrastructure.                
                

            
                We heard him reassert his threat to veto any bills that come to his desk that stray from his agenda even while he also argued that “policies work as long as politics don’t get in the way.”                
                

            
                Veto threats are politics. Plain and simple.                
                

            
                And while the president may have to use his veto power – and I do understand it as a presidential right and, sometimes, an imperative – it doesn’t help to advance the state of the union, as it were.                
                

            
                It follows that President Obama’s plan for the next two years is to continue down the road that he has been going down for the first six years. He will focus his policies on middle class families and lowering taxes for working families; ensuring that Americans get universal childcare and paid sick leave and that women earn the same as men and that we raise the minimum wage; closing tax loopholes and raising taxes on the rich.                
                

            
                These are important goals and policies that by and large I agree with. But redistributionist policies are not the only solutions that are worthwhile to explore.                
                

            
                We need to do more and to combine both the Democratic and Republican agenda. And while President Obama ended his speech with the type of language we heard after the midterms – “we need debate without demonizing each other,” he said – it is still not clear that the president is willing to practice what he preaches."
Why some Democrats are turning on Obama,"Last week the three most powerful Democrats in the state of West Virginia — Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, Senator Joe Manchin and Rep. Nick Rahall – made a public display of turning their backs on President Obama by announcing plans to skip the Democratic National Convention.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The president lost West Virginia in 2008 and his polling there remains weak. So local Democrats have decided they have no problem embarrassing the man whose name will be on the top of their ticket in November.                
                

            
                The same political distancing act is on display in Pennsylvania’s 12th congressional district. Conservative Democrat Mark Critz also says he has better things to do than go to the convention. Rep. Critz said he will be working in his district instead of  “focusing on the agendas of the political parties.”                
                

            
                In the harsh, polarized world of Washington politics, Republicans take delight in opposing every legislative proposal from President Obama.                
                

            
                But when the history of Obama’s first term is written, conservative Democrats will also be remembered for regularly throwing wrenches into any plans coming from this president.                
                

            
                The conservative Democrats — mostly elected from swing states in the anti-President George W. Bush wave elections of 2006 and 2008 — gave the president headaches even when Democrats controlled the House and Senate.                
                

            
                The best example was the fight over health care reform.                
                

            
                Republicans did not give the president a single vote despite a plan that followed previous GOP proposals — most notably Mitt Romney’s Massachusetts law — and excludes a public option for insurance. That left the president in need of every Democrat’s vote. Note that liberal Democrats who wanted a public option did not abandon the president.                
                

            
                But those conservative Democrats squeezed the Obama Team for concessions and amendments that allowed Republican critics to disparage the negotiations as “Chicago-style” bribery used to win support for a bad proposal.                
                

            
                Words and phrases such as  “kickbacks” and “sausage making” became associated with healthcare reform. And they became Republican talking points that drove down public support for the healthcare deal even as most Americans praised the individual changes the bill achieved.                
                

            
                The president again had trouble with conservative Democrats in April when he said he would veto any transportation bill that included the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada. Conservative Democrats walked out on the president when 69 of them joined the GOP to vote legislation that included the oil sands pipeline.                
                

            
                And in the last week, seven conservative Senate Democrats undercut the president’s negotiations with Republicans over a budget deal. They have declined to adopt the president’s negotiating position against another extension of the Bush-era income tax rates.                
                

            
                The move weakens Obama in negotiations with the GOP.                
                

            
                A weak presidential candidate at the top of the ticket does not usually help anyone on the ticket. But in this election cycle conservative Democrats obviously see their political fortunes as separate from Obama’s.                
                

            
                One of those conservative Democrats, Sen. Claire McCaskill, is locked in a tough reelection fight in Missouri, a state Obama lost in 2008. In addition to backing away from the president on the budget deal, she is also backing away on immigration policy changes allowing young illegal immigrants in high school or the military to avoid deportation.                
                

            
                “My preference would be for Congress to resolve this issue …,” McCaskill said. “I’ll be looking at the details of this announcement closely to ensure it isn’t a magnet for illegal immigration.”                
                

            
                McCaskill is distancing herself from the president in the hope of persuading swing voters that she is more of an independent than a Democrat.                
                

            
                A Rasmussen poll taken earlier this month found McCaskill losing to her likely GOP opponent by 12 points. McCaskill needs independent voters and she does not see the Obama brand helping her cause.                
                

            
                From the Obama campaign’s perspective, the conservative Democrats’ strategy is damaging.                
                

            
                Obama also wants to win over independents. He could use conservative Democrats as allies.                
                

            
                The result is the White House never punishes the turncoats.                
                

            
                The Obama campaign is too busy energizing its liberal base right now with support for gay marriage, the new immigration policy and preventing student loans from skyrocketing. Those policies may be enough punishment for Democrats seeking socially-conservative independent voters.                
                

            
                The real question for conservative Democrats now is whether any voters will think they are not actually Democrats because of stunts such as avoiding  the national convention.                
                

            
                In Pennsylvania’s 12th District, the campaign manager for Rep. Critz’s Republican opponent doubts skipping the Charlotte convention will do it.                
                

            
                Rep. Critz “can run from President Obama all he wants …,” said Jon Raso. “This is just the latest ploy … to distance himself from the president in desperation of saving his political career.”                
                

            
                Maybe Obama will throw a wrench in Critz’s plan by endorsing him.

It's time to protect our rights -- and our economy -- by ending health care mandates,"The majority of state Attorneys General have pointed out a fatal flaw in Obama care that the administration refuses to acknowledge: the administration has claimed a power that the Constitution does not grant.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                 
                

            
                The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the Attorneys General in their assertion that it is unconstitutional to force individuals to purchase health insurance. It didn’t matter which President appointed the judges who concurred with the AGs, be it Clinton or one of the Bushes.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Then there is the question of the level playing field. Americans like fairness. But it seems that everyone is not expected to suffer in the same way.                
                

            
                ?A year ago, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius had a moment of accidental clarity. She spoke with a reporter from The Hill about temporary waivers she was providing — more than 1,000 — to give certain groups a pass from complying with provisions of the new health care law.                
                

            
                “We don’t want to take away people’s health insurance before they have some realistic other choices,” Sebelius said.                
                

            
                Many of the waivers she’s talking about go to employers offering “mini-med” plans: those that offer a small amount of inexpensive coverage for low-wage workers. The plans will be banned under the new health care reform law.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                Of course, during the debate about health care reform, Americans were promised that their current coverage wouldn’t be taken away. “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,” the president repeated. He also said Americans would ultimately save up to $2,500 per year on their health care coverage. In their wisdom, Americans never believed it, which is probably why ObamaCare has never found favor in the polls.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                ?A troubling aspect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) touches on your constitutional protections, along with your health care coverage and costs.  Beginning in 2014, every American will be required to own a health insurance plan approved by the federal government. Attorneys generals and governors representing 29 states believe that the so-called “individual mandate” is an unconstitutional expansion of federal power that asserts near total control over your health care coverage. The mandate also demonstrates how the federal government, when it assumes powers it was never intended to have, micro-manages the personal decisions of every American.                
                

            
                Federal Judge Roger Vinson, in his ruling which struck down the individual health care mandate, pointed out that Congress ignored warnings from the Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office that the mandate would be unprecedented and constitutionally problematic. Congress essentially invited litigation.                
                

            
                Congressional staffers were likely troubled about the mandate’s legality because of questions about whether the Commerce Clause authorizes Congress to compel all Americans to purchase a product in the private marketplace.  Under the clause, Congress has the limited power to regulate commerce among the states. It was originally intended to allow the federal government to eliminate trade barriers put up between states.                
                

            
                ?A clause meant to spark trade and economic opportunity shouldn’t be used to the opposite effect when it comes to health care.  With the mandate in place, gone will be most policies that, for example, allow healthy people to buy inexpensive, catastrophic coverage.  Such policies prevent bankruptcies related to extended hospitalizations. Instead, Congress and the president require that every American have a plan that offers “free” preventative care, along with a long list of other minimum benefits. Resist and face an IRS fine.                
                

            
                What does it mean for you? You will pay more – not less, as promised – for your health care coverage. As the National Center for Policy Analysis reports, it costs less than $3,000 a year to cover the medical expenses of most Americans under 50. Yet, under the ACA, the minimum benefit package allowed will cost about $4,750.  Where will the $1,750 annual difference come from? If you’re lucky enough to be employed, it will come out of future raises. If you’re one of the 14 million unemployed Americans, there’s an even bigger price: when the cost of labor increases, employers think twice about new hires.                
                

            
                As has been widely reported, uncertainty about the economy, and how federal activism will play into potential growth, has companies sitting on nearly $2 trillion in cash and other assets instead of investing in job-creating activities.  Congress exacerbated the problem by remaking one-sixth of the economy through a partisan process. Now, as the  constitutionally-questionable new law makes its way through the courts, other provisions – including billions in new taxes and government spending – roll out over a period of six years. And before that, another national election will decide control of the U.S. House, Senate and the White House. It’s no surprise that investors are waiting it out.                 
                

            
                A better approach would have sought bipartisan reforms. Make health care plans portable. Allow price competition by letting plans be sold across state lines. Create tax incentives for purchasing insurance instead of deploying IRS agents to seek out stragglers. These are some of the ideas supported by clear majorities of both parties. They leave constitutional protections in place.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                It’s not too late to change course and clear away at least some of the economic uncertainty caused by the ACA.  Congress should cancel individual mandate, resolving the biggest aspect of multi-state lawsuit.  It should focus instead on encouraging a stronger, less encumbered, national market for health insurance that provides consumers and employers with a greater array of affordable insurance options.                
                

            
                ?                
                

            
                Our Constitution limits federal control, reserving certain powers for the federal government and leaving the rest reserved to the states – and to the people.  It’s a system that created the freest, most prosperous nation in the world. To bolster that freedom and prosperity, Congress and the president must act to pass health care reforms that respect our Constitutional rights, while providing more choices of affordable, portable health care plans. Our pocketbooks, and our health, will benefit.

                President Obama and Democrats are just getting started on the argument that the Supreme Court is under control of a bunch of right-wing bullies.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Here are four high-profile, highly political cases with clear potential to advance the Democrats’ case by undermining the Supreme Court’s standing as an impartial, independent branch of government.                
                

            
                1) Health Care:                
                

            
                A Pew poll from last week found that 21 percent of Americans have a less favorable view of the Court after oral arguments in the health care case. Only 7 percent report a more favorable view. President Obama is just one among many Americans whose faith in the impartiality of the Supreme Court is waning because of the aggressive, ideological posturing by conservative members of the Court during the oral arguments.                
                

            
                At stake is the survival of President Obama’s health care reform act, specifically the individual mandate to purchase health insurance. Even staunchly conservative legal minds like Circuit Court Judges Jeffrey Sutton and Laurence Silberman have said the law is well within previous rulings of the court and defeating it amounts to judicial overreach. And, as the polls show, it is not just a few conservative judges who feel that way.                
                

            
                2) Affirmative Action:                
                

            
                The Court also will hear a case regarding the use of race in the admissions process at the University of Texas. In a 2003 decision involving the University of Michigan Law School, the Court held use of race as one factor among many in considering an applicant did not violate the 14th Amendment. By even agreeing to hear the Texas case, the Court has signaled a willingness to reconsider its previous decision. A reversal, coming so quickly, will be a break from the belief that judges should respect precedent -- which the conservative justices all claimed to support in their confirmation hearings.                
                

            
                3) Immigration:                
                

            
                In 2010, Arizona’s immigration law gave the police broad new powers to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally. A federal judge blocked the law and the Court will hear Arizona’s appeal this session. If the conservative majority overturns the previous ruling, the controversial law will be allowed to stand. This would give other states license to adopt similar politically controversial anti-immigration laws.                
                

            
                4) Voting Rights:                
                

            
                The court will decide if the Justice Department can use the 1965 Voting Rights Act as the basis for review of election laws in 16 mostly Southern states. These states have a history of racial discrimination and disenfranchisement of minorities. DOJ has used its power under the Voting Rights Act to block new voter identification laws in South Carolina and Texas’ new proposed redistricting map. Conservatives have never liked the power given to the federal government under the Voting Rights Act.                
                

            
                This case is extremely explosive at a time when the GOP is aggressively pushing voter identification laws that will depress the turnout of liberal-leaning young and minority voters -- likely voters for Democrats.                
                

            
                                 
                

            
                According to polls, the overall level of public respect for the court is fading fast as it becomes just another venue for the polarized tug of war between liberals and conservatives. A January 2012 poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 75 percent of Americans believe Supreme Court justices let their own ideological views influence their decisions, while only 17 percent think the justices decide cases based on legal analysis. The Gallup poll finds that public trust in the high court has declined from 50 percent 10 years ago to 37 percent today.                
                

            
                Starting with its unprecedented decision in Bush v. Gore -- where the Court effectively decided a presidential election in favor of Republican George W. Bush -- and followed by the Citizens United case opening the door to big money dominating campaigns, the Court is increasingly seen as just another manifestation of the right-left polarization that characterizes American politics in the 21st century. The image of the justices rising above politics is close to a historical artifact.                
                

            
                The reason is clear: The frequency of 5-4 decisions on hot-button political issues in recent years has caused many people to believe that justice is not blind to politics or the influence of money. That includes last week’s decision to allow Americans to be strip-searched after being taken into custody for even a minor crime.                
                

            
                When the Court decided Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, Chief Justice Earl Warren made sure that the decision was unanimous. Segregation of public schools was such an extraordinary case that Warren knew that many Americans, especially in the South, would question the Court’s ruling if the decision split even 8-1.                
                

            
                For Warren, preserving respect for the institution was more important than the short-term ideological divides of the day. He even sent a draft of his opinion to the hospital bedside of Justice Robert Jackson to win his support.                
                

            
                Warren’s example is worth keeping in mind for Chief Justice Roberts as the court decides the current series of highly political cases this year. A series of 5-4 decisions on contentious political issues that are normally decided by legislatures could do irreparable harm to the Court’s already troubled reputation.

                The easiest part of the Affordable Care Act was supposed to be designing a user-friendly website that prompted millions to sign up for health insurance with just few clicks. To describe the launch as a colossal fiasco is putting it mildly.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                While many feel slighted with a “glitchy” website, the Latino community has been utterly dismissed. That’s because if you speak only Spanish, the Administration didn’t even bother to fully rollout an ObamaCare website for you. Yet, something tells me they won’t have any difficulties sending us the penalty notice for not signing up – in Spanish.

                Still, while much attention is currently being focused on the mutilation of a website, those of us who mistrust Washington’s growing control and power are most distressed about the damage Obamacare’s full implementation will do to the nation’s healthcare system.                
                

            
                President Obama promised that his health reform plan would lower health costs, expand choice, and improve quality of care. Yet, as the program is unveiled – piece by broken piece – none of these promises are materializing. Americans are losing full-time employment, millions have been dropped from their employer insurance rolls, and many doctors won’t participate.                
                

            
                And worst of all, the care is not affordable. While a Bronze Plan – the cheapest insurance available under the ACA – will cost many families more than they are currently paying, they will have to cover 40 percent of their medical bills out of pocket through deductibles and co-payments — up to as much as $12,700 per year for a family. Consider also that 65 percent of Hispanics are millennials, meaning they will pay much more for a product they don’t need, didn’t ask for and cannot afford.

                But it’s not enough to cite the flaws with the law; conservatives should offer something better, now, while we are still at a crossroads. To that end, real reform should build on the best of the current system, and go back to the “American way” of doing things. Medical care must put the customer first, and allow government a limited role.                
                

            
                In replacing the president’s health law, Republicans and Democrats should work together on reforms that focus on three main principles: Empowering the individual consumer, encouraging a competitive marketplace, and providing for the truly needy.                
                

            
                Empower the Individual Consumers                
                

            
                True reform should empower individuals to make their own choices – not limit options and mandate participation. Expanding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) is a good first step. HSAs provide tax breaks to help people afford medical care, and to empower them to make their own health care choices – instead of leaving governments or employers in charge. They also restore market incentives to control costs, through competition.                
                

            
                Congress should also consider personal tax credits for buying health insurance. Right now employers get a tax break if they offer care to their workers. Why not allow ordinary Americans to take this credit if they choose — so that they can purchase care if they are not satisfied with what their company may offer? Unlike the president’s health care law, this would build on the current system, while creating new options for those who want something different.                
                

            
                Encourage a Competitive Marketplace                
                

            
                Overregulation stifles the market’s ability to provide innovative options, and arbitrary regulation leaves many with unmet demands. For example, right now, people may only buy insurance that meets the mandates set in their state of residence. This can make it extremely expensive for people in states with heavy regulations that protect powerful interest groups. We don’t prevent people from going out-of-state to buy a car, or home appliances, or higher education. Why should insurance be any different?                
                

            
                Tort reform must also be part of health care reform. Lawsuit abuse drives up the cost of health care, and doctors ultimately pass on the cost of frivolous litigation to their patients. Traditional tort standards for medical liability should be strictly enforced. Non-economic damages, such as compensation for pain and suffering should be limited and punitive damages should apply only in criminal proceedings. These reforms would ensure fair compensation for those hurt by doctors without inflating costs.                
                

            
                In theory, health insurance exchanges expand choice and encourage competition. The Affordable Care Act, however, eliminates these positive effects by requiring all plans sold in exchanges to meet the same federal guidelines. Private exchanges allow trade associations, civic groups, and businesses of all sizes to offer their employees and members a wide range of alternatives.                
                

            
                Provide for the Truly Needy                
                

            
                There is a role for government in health care reform, but it should be limited to providing a safety net for the truly needy. On the state-level, high-risk pools for the uninsured should be expanded. It’s important that health care reform help those who are currently unable to afford insurance. One way to do that – without hurting the tens of millions who are happy with their health care – is through the expansion of high-risk pools. Most states have these already. They provide coverage for those who cannot obtain insurance because of their health conditions, subsidizing the cost of policies through a tax on insurance companies or by general tax revenues. This is a better approach than forcing these individuals into the regular market and increasing costs for others.                
                

            
                Lastly, it is essential that reform protects Medicare beneficiaries and improves Medicaid. Right now seniors have few options under Medicare, whose funding has been slashed to pay for the Affordable Care Act. Medicaid is even worse. The program is driving up the federal deficit, and offering extremely limited care with outcomes that are no better than going without insurance. It is shameful that low-income Americans are locked into this failing program.                
                

            
                Ultimately, if we are to be a thriving and healthy society we must still be that country where entrepreneurs compete by constantly improving customer service, charging competitive prices, and innovating in order to achieve the trust and loyalty of their customer base. Putting government regulators in charge leaves too many Americans behind — including those who speak Spanish, and the millions who are losing their policies. We need a better approach.

"JUAN WILLIAMS: If Capitol Hill Is High School, Michele Bachmann Is the 'It' Girl of the Moment","If Capitol Hill is really one big high school, the “It” girl of the moment is Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.).                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                A recent Gallup poll of Republicans found Bachmann had the second-highest positive intensity rating of any of the potential 2012 candidates in the GOP field. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas and my colleague at Fox, came in first.                
                

            
                In the last week alone, newspapers ranging from The New York Times to The Washington Times have run profiles on Bachmann full of speculation about her next move in the GOP presidential contest. She has made numerous trips to Iowa and New Hampshire, suggesting she might make a run for the presidency as either a Republican or a third party, Tea Party-backed candidate. TV’s John McLaughlin declared on his show that Bachmann will be the 2012 Republican nominee for vice president.                
                

            
                But what about Bachmann’s current job?                
                

            
                She is the founder and leader of the 52-member House Tea Party Caucus and serves on two key committees: Intelligence and Financial Services. And in amazing fashion, she now seems to be running her own shadow Republican caucus in which she is speaker, floor leader, whip and conference chairwoman for the Tea Party passions that threaten to split Republicans on the Hill.                
                

            
                She tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up the most recent continuing resolution because of a hitherto unseen $105 billion in healthcare reform funding. She managed to corral 54 “no” votes, mostly from freshmen Republicans, and gave the impression that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) cannot control his own caucus.                
                

            
                Bachmann’s rock-star status on the far right has put the House GOP leadership in a difficult position. She is undermining the ability of the Republican majority in the House to govern.                
                

            
                She raised eyebrows by giving a Tea Party response to the State of the Union, stealing the spotlight from the official Republican respondent, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). Bachmann is likely to be in the spotlight again this week with Tea Party Patriots rallying at the Capitol against Republicans in the leadership — Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Ryan — who are trying to reach a compromise on the 2011 budget and the debt ceiling. It is easy to forget that in January she lost her bid for chairman of the House Republican Conference, the No. 4 leadership spot.                
                

            
                On talk radio and conservative websites, the congresswoman is the star witness against any budget deal. She argues with fury and sparkling eyes that proposed cuts in spending have been too shallow and there is no need to fear a government shutdown. Bachmann is also livid that health care reform is the law of the land, oblivious to the fact that it is increasingly popular with the public and every effort to reverse it can be blocked by the Democratically-controlled Senate.                
                

            
                Will she attempt to derail the next continuing resolution because she deems it to be insufficiently conservative? How about the vote to raise the debt ceiling? How long will the GOP leadership indulge her antics on important votes? Can they really do anything to stop her?                
                

            
                Boehner must be careful how he deals with Bachmann and her supporters. Ohio Tea Party activists have already launched a phone campaign in his home district to complain he is not a true conservative for failing to block a possible debt-limit increase. Judson Phillips, founder of Tea Party Nation, is openly looking for a recruit to run against Boehner in the next primary. “Charlie Sheen is now making more sense than John Boehner,” a mocking Phillips wrote recently.                
                

            
                So as the next election draws closer, Boehner might need Bachmann and her Tea Party credibility as a working member of Congress to mollify those brash, uncompromising forces in the party. And the Speaker could also use her unrivaled stature to push back against Tea Party primary challenges to several vulnerable Republicans who are loyal to him.                
                

            
                If Bachmann plays her cards right and begins to pick her battles more strategically, she could have considerable leverage on the Hill. However, the business of being a serious legislator and political power broker is not always fun. It certainly cannot be as fun as going on television every night, flirting with a run for president and being talked about as the leader of a radical political movement.                
                

            
                But Bachmann is also dancing on the razor’s edge of becoming marginalized as someone who is not serious — a self-serving celebrity, in high school lingo a “Mean Girl.”                
                

            
                That is the same toxic formula that has led to Sarah Palin’s falling poll numbers. Boehner might decide the smart play is to take on Bachmann in an effort to increase his appeal to mainstream Republicans, independents and conservative Democrats.                
                

            
                The “It” girl may just be the one to bring out the tough guy in John Boehner.

                Republicans know what polls show — that most Americans don’t know what’s in ObamaCare, but when told what the law actually includes, a strong majority support the law.                
                

            
                Once state health insurance exchanges take effect, and premiums for all Americans go down, Republicans know the law will only become more popular and harder to repeal.                  
                

            
                As Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “It's a lot harder to undo something than it is to stop it in the first place.”                  
                

            
                Exactly.

                Because just like Republicans railed against Social Security and Medicaid and Medicare when they were first proposed, those programs are now highly effective and broadly popular parts of our social safety net — supported even by strong majorities of Republican voters.                 
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                So, for those of you who have been too busy criticizing ObamaCare for partisan reasons to actually look at what’s in the law — and see what Americans like about it — here is a handy-dandy review:                
                

            
                1.  ACA allows young Americans to stay on their parents’ insurance plans                
                

            
                Because of ObamaCare, which allows kids to stay on their parents insurance plans until age 26, 3.4 million young Americans now have coverage.                  
                

            
                The percentage of uninsured young people (ages 19 to 25) fell accordingly, from 48% in 2010 to 21% in 2012.                 
                

            
                According to polling, three-in-four Americans support this part of the Affordable Care Act including, yes, over two-thirds of Republicans.                  
                

            
                2.  ACA bans insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions                
                

            
                Another aspect of ObamaCare that has already taken effect is the ban on insurance companies denying coverage to patients based on pre-existing conditions.                  
                

            
                That means an end to insurance company horror stories like four-month-old Alex Lange being denied health insurance because he was too chubby.                 
                

            
                This is why the conservative allegation about death panels is so ironic; while the actual ACA law does not contain death panels or anything remotely like them, the fact is that prior to ObamaCare, insurance companies were effectively operating like death panels in denying life-saving coverage to anyone with a pre-existing condition and by applying life-time spending caps on coverage.                
                

            
                The ban on pre-existing condition limits, which will apply to every single American by 2014, is supported by 83% of Americans.                 
                

            
                3.  ACA offers tax credits to small businesses to buy insurance                
                

            
                The Affordable Care Act expands tax credits to help small businesses provide health insurance to their workers.  Companies with fewer than 50 employees do not have to provide insurance, but even for these businesses, ObamaCare will make it easier and cheaper if they choose to do so.                  
                

            
                According to polling, 88% of Americans think these small business tax credits are great, including — wait for it ... yes, 83% of Republicans.  That’s right, over eight-in-ten Republicans support the provision of ObamaCare that helps small businesses afford and expand their health insurance offerings to employees.                 
                

            
                4.  ACA requires companies with more than 50 employees to provide health insurance                
                

            
                Over 96% of companies with more than 50 employees already provide health insurance to their employees.  And contrary to Republicans claiming otherwise, studies show the vast majority of those employers do not plan to drop or reduce that coverage because of ObamaCare.                  
                

            
                Also, there is no evidence that ObamaCare has led to companies slashing full-time workers.  In fact, since ObamaCare passed in March 2010, over 90% of the gain in employment has been full-time positions.                 
                

            
                Still, we know that companies that can afford to provide health insurance to their workers and yet fail to do so off-set the costs of care onto the rest of us — whether the cost of emergency room treatment that gets passed on to other consumers, or Medicaid coverage that we pay for as taxpayers.                  
                

            
                In Florida alone, more than 50,000 workers at companies like McDonald’s and Burger King are on the state’s Medicaid rolls.  Especially with tax credits available to small businesses, there is no excuse for companies to pass the buck.  And 75% of Americans support this element of ObamaCare.                
                

            
                5.  ACA provides subsidies to help individuals afford coverage                
                

            
                Many of the 45 million Americans who lack health insurance simply don’t have enough money to afford coverage.  ObamaCare will lower the cost of premiums but also provide subsidies to help low- and middle-income Americans purchase insurance.                 
                

            
                Americans who earn $45,000 per year (about 400% of the federal poverty level) will qualify for some form of subsidy.  The amount of the subsidy will be based on income as well as the cost of health coverage in a particular state but, for instance, according to a subsidy calculator created by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a 27-year-old living in Houston, Texas, who earns just $15,000 a year could sign-up for a mid-level plan for about $300 per year with the help of subsidies.  Without subsidies, that plan would cost $2,400 per year.                  
                

            
                The few Americans who think subsidizing care is a bad idea should, again, note that we already subsidize health care to a far greater degree in the form of Medicaid and also when the uninsured rely on free emergency room care and pass those astronomical costs on to the rest of us.  But most Americans — 76% to be exact — support the individual subsidy.  That includes 61% of Republicans.                
                

            
                There’s even more aspects of ObamaCare that the American people already support — including the employer mandate, the increased Medicare payroll tax on higher-income Americans and the expansion of Medicaid.                   
                

            
                And then, starting October 1, here’s one more:                
                

            
                6.  State-based health insurance exchanges                
                

            
                Americans of all political stripes like choice and competition, which is precisely what the ObamaCare health insurance exchanges will create.  So it’s no wonder that 80% of Americans — including 72% of Republicans — support the health insurance exchange program in ObamaCare.  And that’s even before the exchanges have taken effect!                  
                

            
                Plus, a new report shows that health insurance premiums will be even lower under ObamaCare than originally projected.                  
                

            
                Personally, as someone who pays through the nose for individual insurance in New York State — a state where, historically, few individual insurance options have even been available — I can’t wait to enroll in ObamaCare and see my premiums plummet, as they are expected to by at least 50%.                  
                

            
                Again, all this is why Republicans are in such a desperate rush to try and defund ObamaCare before October 1 — even if it means holding our economy hostage and even if most voters, including Republicans, oppose the repeated and wasteful defunding attempts.                  
                

            
                After all, the law is already popular when it’s not fully in effect and most people haven’t felt its benefits.  We all know what will happen when ObamaCare takes effect — and works!                 
                

            
                Republicans who are throwing temper tantrums over sour grapes need to grow up.                  
                

            
                Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, President Obama signed it into law and the Supreme Court upheld its constitutionality.                  
                

            
                The cost of doing nothing on health care reform was too great and the cost of repeatedly refighting the political battles of the past is obscene.  But then again, it makes perfect sense why Republicans refuse to just give up and shut up — because the minute they do, there will be no more distractions from all the good things about ObamaCare.

"1 year after Newtown, support for stricter gun control has disappeared","Now Playing                            Gun control advocates politicizing Newtown tragedy?                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Obama has pushed hard for gun control this year and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has spent millions of dollars on ads, but the administration's promise to coordinate ""a November lobbying effort and plan events to commemorate the first anniversary of the Newtown, Connecticut"" has gotten little traction.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Last year the Newtown shooting, with it horrific slaughter, lead to an immediate national movement for gun control. But that was short-lived, and opposition to gun control is currently very strong. Indeed, it appears to be the strongest in decades.                
                

            
                A recent CNN poll finds the highest level of opposition to any new gun control measures since CNN started asking about it in 1989. Rising from only 28 percent opposed to new gun control measures then to 50 percent today. And it's not the only poll with such findings. Gallup finds that opposition to stricter laws has risen from 19 to 50 percent.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                What’s more, these polls don’t reflect that most people in favor of gun control don’t have strong feelings about it. Monthly Gallup polls from June to October this year reveal it’s just not viewed as a pressing issue.

                In fact, it didn't even make the list of top 15 issues that Americans were most concerned about. In only one month, May, did as many as 7 percent of Americans say that they were most concerned about gun control (and that includes both sides of the issue), but since June it has ranged between 1 and 3 percent.                
                

            
                Recent newspaper headlines mirror these polls. Over the last couple days the Washington Post announced ""How gun control is losing, badly (in charts)"" or ""Gun-control groups are shifting efforts and resources to handful of states.""                 
                

            
                Even at the state level the New York Times paints an anemic movement, counting up the passage of state gun laws, 39 tightening restrictions and 70 liberalizing them.                
                

            
                It almost seems as if gun control advocates like the New York Times are going out of their way to make their side look weak.                 
                

            
                The more restrictive laws are going to do a lot more to reduce gun ownership than the liberalizations will increase it.                 
                

            
                Maryland is now going to charge over $350 to license and register handguns and buyers will have to undergo four hours of training.                 
                

            
                Yet, the Times viewed that as equivalent to West Virginia’s change that exempts concealed-carry permit holders who have already undergone background checks from another background check when they buy a gun.                
                

            
                A frequent claim by control advocates this year has been that 80 percent to 90 percent of Americans are in favor of expanded background-checks legislation. But the polls showing such overwhelming support really ask little more than whether people want to stop criminals from obtaining guns, not whether voters actually favor the legislation that the Senate was voting on.                
                

            
                The actual laws being discussed were much less popular.                 
                

            
                For example, a mid-April poll by the Pew Research Center provides one such illustration when it asks voters whether they were happy that the Senate bill had been defeated. While 67 percent of Democrats were “disappointed” or “angry” about the defeat, more Republicans and independents were “ very happy” or “relieved” than upset by the defeat.                
                

            
                But gun control advocates aren’t giving up. They are patient, and they have money.                 
                

            
                Mayor Bloomberg recently donated $250 million to the Bloomberg School of Public Health for 40 new academic positions, many of whom will deal with gun control issues. And that is in addition to the 8 people already doing so at the school.                 
                

            
                Similarly, President Obama met with 23 foundations in January where they agreed to shift their focus from health care reform to gun control issues.                
                

            
                As if that wasn't enough, in June the federal government’s National Research Council issued a new report supporting Obama's push for federal funding of research on gun issues. The lopsidedness of the report is just a sign of things to come, of research to be funded by the Obama administration.                
                

            
                The newest strategy by gun control advocates seems to be a stealth strategy -- sneaking in fees and taxes for obtaining guns. These are penalties that will reduce gun ownership, particular for the very people who need them the most, the most likely victims of crime, the poor in high-crime urban neighborhoods.                
                

            
                Alas, the issue of gun control isn’t going away any time soon.

Why Rick Perry Gives Me Hope On Health Care,"As I watched Texas Governor Rick Perry announce his presidential candidacy this weekend, he gave me a sense of hope and his speech really resonated with me.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                His words reminded me of the respect that we as Americans deserve, and the importance of a government that works for us and with us – rather than the downward spiral that the current political and economic climate has continued to indulge.                
                

            
                In his speech on Saturday, Perry pledged to free Americans from ""the grips of central planners who would control our health care, who would spend our treasure, who downgrade our future and micromanage our lives."" And I’d like to think that he would keep his word.                
                

            
                He has successfully led Texas for more than 10 years through one of the hardest economic downturns in American history.                
                

            
                Now, being a practicing physician, naturally, health care reform is high on my radar. Over the past few years, I have commented extensively on the topic and the overall challenges that the practice of medicine is facing these days. So I decided to take a closer look at the state of medicine in Texas.                
                

            
                I was surprised to find that Texas is considered by many doctors, nurses and health care professionals in general, to be among the best states in the country to practice medicine.                 
                

            
                Several surveys have found that there are many benefits to practicing medicine in the state of Texas including a variety of top-quality medical centers, affordable housing for medical professionals and their families, no state income tax, and finally, a well-balanced liability reform which protects both patients and doctors, without the looming threat of frivolous law suits.                
                

            
                I have to say, that my first impression of Gov. Perry, as the successful leader of the second largest state in the union has piqued my interest in seeing what he would be capable of achieving for our country.                
                

            
                I’ve been practicing medicine for more than 30 years, and I love what I do.That's why it's so important to me that we protect the institution of American medicine that was built on the same principles woven into the very fabric of this great country.                
                

            
                So this is my personal opinion, as a father of three and a proud American, but also, as a doctor who wants to continue to improve the quality of medical care without worrying about the bureaucrats looking over my shoulder in the future.

New ObamaCare taxes are hitting millions where it hurts. It's time to repeal them,"FILE -- 
                                    
                                         (REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman)
                                    
                                
                            
                        
                	
            
        
    

    

								
								



 



       
       
      
          
              Tax reform legislation signed into law by President Trump in December, which will lower taxes for most Americans this year, unfortunately did nothing to stop billions of dollars in new taxes under ObamaCare from hitting millions of Americans in the wallet.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This is because while the tax reform law weakens part of ObamaCare – by basically ending the mandate requiring individuals to buy health insurance coverage – important parts of the health-care law still remain in effect. These include: a big expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health program serving the poor; federal regulations on health insurance markets; and several taxes to finance the health-care law.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Three of the ObamaCare taxes have been targeted for elimination by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers who are concerned about raising the cost of health insurance for so many Americans. While the official name of ObamaCare is the Affordable Care Act, the new taxes harm rather than protect consumers and make health insurance less affordable.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              The ObamaCare taxes being targeted by opponents are: the so-called “Cadillac tax” on some high-value health insurance policies; an excise tax on medical devices; and a 4 to 6 percent tax on some insurance policies when they are sold. While the “Cadillac tax” hasn’t gone into effect, both the health insurance and medical device taxes became effective Jan. 1.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Although Republicans did not create ObamaCare, they are in a golden position to do something about the rising premiums that have resulted.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              The health insurance tax is troubling because it’s paid for directly by consumers, in the form of higher premiums. So millions of us will take a direct hit, even though most people who will be paying for the tax increase don’t even realize it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Lawmakers and President Trump should consider immediately ending the health insurance tax, whether as part of their discussions regarding a spending package for the remainder of 2018 or as part of additional health-care reform efforts.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              In addition to the taxes imposed by ObamaCare, there are a number of factors that influence how much consumers generally pay for health insurance.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For example, the premium is impacted by the specific benefits and health-care providers that are part of the plan. The premium is also affected by the relative health or sickness of others who participate in an insurance plan. Plans that include a larger proportion of sicker beneficiaries overall will be more expensive, while plans with a healthier mix of enrollees are cheaper.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The new health insurance tax applies to so-called “fully-insured” health insurance plans. It will be paid by: consumers who purchase their coverage on the individual market (including ObamaCare’s health insurance exchanges); many employees of small businesses that furnish coverage; and even some people who get their health insurance through large employers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The new health insurance tax also applies to seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage or Medicare prescription drug plans, as well as low-income Americans in Medicaid managed care plans.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax will raise about $13 billion in revenue in 2018 alone, and about $145 billion over the next 10 years. But these numbers don’t tell the full story of how the health insurance tax impacts families, small businesses and taxpayers across America.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A study last year by Oliver Wyman Health found that the health insurance tax will increase annual health insurance premiums in 2018 by $158 per person in the individual market; about $500 per family for those getting coverage through many small employers and some large employers; and $245 for each Medicare Advantage member.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These increases will accelerate in 2019 and beyond. So over the next 10 years, the study concludes that individual market beneficiaries will pay over $2,000 more in premiums; families getting their coverage through small employers will pay over $6,000 more; and Medicare Advantage members will pay over $3,000 more.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Medicaid managed-care enrollees will see premium increases of $181 in 2018 and an estimated $2,370 over the next 10 years. These costs won’t be borne by the low-income beneficiaries of the program. Instead, states and their taxpayers will foot the bill.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As insurance premiums rise – in part because of the health insurance tax – healthier consumers are more likely to forego health insurance. This concept, known as adverse selection, will leave only sicker consumers – particularly in the individual and small-group marketplaces.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              With a higher proportion of sicker individuals on health insurance rolls, the cost of an insurance policy will become even more unaffordable. The effective elimination of the individual mandate to purchase health insurance could actually worsen this trend. This is because there will be even less economic incentive for healthy consumers, in particular, to buy coverage. This will tend to boost premiums even more for those who are sicker or need health insurance coverage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Republicans, then, have both a policy and political imperative to get rid of ObamaCare’s health insurance tax. While the tax certainly isn’t the only reason that many consumers are experiencing higher premiums this year, it is an important factor.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Although Republicans did not create ObamaCare, they are in a golden position to do something about the rising premiums that have resulted. A failure to do so may hurt congressional Republicans when they come before the voters in this November’s midterm elections. And that’s a risk they shouldn’t take.

"President Trump is a change agent, the Washington establishment hates change - cue sound and fury","President Donald Trump was elected our nation’s 45th president not beholden to Washington or any special interest in its swamp.  President Trump is a change agent unlike any President the American people have ever seen.  He’s the first non-politician to be elected president since General Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952.   President Trump was elected as a successful businessman to break up Washington’s failed status quo.  What we are witnessing is the ultimate political outsider enacting real change.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                So all the sound and fury emanating from Washington? That’s what it sounds like when an entrenched political class that is radically averse to change is forced to confront it, head-on. And all the noise is obscuring one very important fact, and that is that 161 days into the Trump Presidency – once you cut through the permanent obstruction campaign being waged by the Democrats and all the noise emanating from the liberal media – genuine progress is being made on the Trump agenda.

                This week’s unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court ordering that the President’s executive order on immigration can largely take effect is an enormous victory for the White House and our national security.  The Supreme Court put its stamp of approval on the fact that the President of the United States has the power to secure our country and that our immigration vetting system needs major improvement. 
                
                


                
            
                This major step on immigration reform creates momentum for the great strides Senate Republicans are already making to fix our nation’s broken health care system.   It’s widely accepted that ObamaCare is failing and has been failing for a long time.  Americans want better health care and more affordable health care.  This is the essence of what President Trump and Congressional Republicans led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are working non-stop to accomplish.  The Democrats by contrast hold the position that it is acceptable to let ObamaCare falter completely.  Make no mistake; the choice on the future of health care is simple.   Republicans are pushing for common sense reform and the Democrats are holding on to a failed system that is going to crash.
                
                


                
            
                Through President Trump’s “America First” leadership, much progress has already been made.  The nomination and confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch for example is a promise made and a promise kept by our president.  This widely praised decision sent a signal to the American people that this president will appoint only supremely qualified defenders of the Constitution to our nation’s highest court.   Similarly, President Trump’s consequential decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord makes clear he is prioritizing the economic interests of the United States of America and the American worker first and foremost.
                
                


                
            
                Additionally, last week President Trump continued to make good on his pledge to prioritize the men and women who have heroically served our country by signing into law the Veterans Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act.  This law is a key part of the President’s reform agenda that will hold employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs more accountable and help to make sure the federal government is giving our veterans the unparalleled respect that they deserve.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Going forward, it is critically important that the U.S. Senate continue to improve their health care reform legislation and get it to President Trump’s desk for his signature.  This landmark accomplishment will enable our country to finally move on from the divisive ObamaCare years and onto policy measures such as tax reform which will make dramatic economic gains and job creation become a reality.  Job creators at businesses both large and small are craving for some economic certainty from our federal government.  They want the certainty that taxes and regulations are going to be cut and that our tax code will be streamlined for the hardworking taxpayers that they employ.  These optimistic pro-growth reforms are something that the American people will rally around.  Hopefully some Senate Democrats from states President Trump carried will feel the same way.
                
                


                
            
                Yes, getting the Washington establishment to change its ways is hard, but President Trump is achieving positive results for the American people that he represents each and every day.

                Here’s what’s clear: Health care costs at Harvard are going up. Immediately. And they are rising directly as a result of ObamaCare.                 
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            We all want life to be better for everyone. Who wouldn’t want all of their fellow Americans, or all of humanity for that matter, to have good health care? But are you willing to personally take a pay cut to pay for the policy you are advocating?
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                The explanation written right at the top of Harvard’s health care enrollment guide for 2015 states that the university “must respond to the national trend of rising health care costs, including some driven by health care reform.” The guide even highlights, in a special little box in the margin, the exact “Impact of Health Care Reform,” explaining that “The Affordable Care Act has brought new benefits and opportunities to many people but with added costs to sponsors.”                
                

            
                Say what?? Who could have predicted that? Anyone who can do math.                 
                

            
                Still, the special little box goes on to point to such benefits as keeping offspring on your plan until they are 26 and the Cadillac tax as added costs. And as a result, they say premiums and deductibles are rising.                 
                

            
                One French history professor gasps without a hint of irony that rising premiums are tantamount to a pay cut! Welcome to our world.                
                

            
                Still the rising costs aren’t necessarily news to everyone. Several years back, Harvard’s own provost, Dr. Alan M. Garber, sent an open letter to President Obama praising the Cadillac tax as a way to rein in health care costs and premiums. In subsequent interviews, he’s defended his stance and the higher costs he and co-workers are now facing.                
                

            
                I’m betting he’s having a hard time finding a tablemate at the Harvard Faculty Club this week.                
                

            
                Provost Garber should not be confused with another economist with a similar sounding name working about a mile down the Charles River at MIT, Jonathan Gruber.                 
                

            
                Gruber infamously counted on the “stupidity of the American voter” to overlook the obvious math that’s now confronting Harvard’s staff. Harvard faculty may be a lot of things, but stupid ain’t one of them.                 
                

            
                In fact, Meredith Rosenthal, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, told the Times she was “puzzled by the outcry. The changes in Harvard faculty benefits are parallel to changes all Americans are seeing. Indeed they have come to our front door much later than others.”                
                

            
                No, I don’t think these folks are surprised by the math. I am a graduate of the Harvard Economics Department, and I have sat in these classrooms. I would bet the faculty just didn’t believe they would have to foot the bill. Costs may rise, but they would somehow be absorbed in the system. Donors, someone … someone else, that is … would pay.                
                

            
                And that is, in fact, one of the main problems in American politics. We all want life to be better for everyone. Who wouldn’t want all of their fellow Americans, or all of humanity for that matter, to have good health care? But are you willing to personally take a pay cut to pay for the policy you are advocating?                
                

            
                That’s the hard question the president and proponents of ObamaCare did not want you to grapple with, because they were afraid your reaction would be akin to the screams now echoing through Harvard Yard.

              Democrat Conor Lamb held a lead of a few hundred votes Wednesday with the final absentee and provisional ballots still being counted in Tuesday’s special election for a Pennsylvania congressional seat, leaving the race too close to call. His strong showing – and likely victory – has important lessons for Democrats for the November elections, when all 435 House seats will be on the ballot.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Republican officials are alleging voting irregularities and plan to seek a court order impounding voting machines in four counties in the district pending a recount.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A victory by Lamb over Republican Rick Saccone in the 18th congressional district near Pittsburgh would be a major upset in a district that voted for Donald Trump by a margin of nearly 20 points in the 2016 presidential race. In the past two congressional elections, Democrats didn’t even field a candidate in the solidly Republican district.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Lamb’s ability to draw so many votes demonstrates that there is a viable, centrist path to victory for Democrats, even in places where President Trump won by double-digit margins.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Notably, Lamb was outspent by Saccone and his allies by a ratio of approximately 5-to-1. Surely, Republicans cannot spend in this way nationwide to retain competitive seats, underscoring their vulnerability.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For these reasons, Lamb’s performance has major negative implications for continued Republican control of the House and vindicates the critical importance of Democrats taking a centrist approach to the most competitive races.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              If the Democrats want to win back the red and swing districts lost to President Trump in 2016, they must follow Lamb’s example and take moderate positions on key issues that are in line with their constituents.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Lamb promised to work with leaders of both parties to take immediate action on the opioid epidemic. He also put forward a plan to work with Republican leaders to stop stalling on infrastructure investment and move forward on multiple projects, as well as job training initiatives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Lamb even supported President Trump’s imposition of heavy tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, two industries that are critical to western Pennsylvania’s economy.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In addition, Lamb took important strides to distance himself from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., openly stating that if elected he would not support her bid to retain her leadership position come November.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Like Lamb, Democratic candidates must take positions that swing voters, especially those who have traditionally voted for Democrats and only recently defected to the Republican Party, can support.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These are voters who applauded the recent tax cuts – the same cuts that Nancy Pelosi infamously called “crumbs.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These voters – especially those who voted for President Obama in 2008 or 2012 and then President Trump in 2016 – support working-class families, particularly members of local unions, and worry about their future financial security.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Indeed, Democrats must not only campaign as centrists but also govern as centrists. This is the key to not only welcoming voters back into the party, but also retaining them in 2020
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To be sure, Lamb’s big vote totals and likely victory in Pennsylvania are a wake-up call for Democrats and Republicans alike.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Saccone’s failure to win an easy victory indicates that the White House and the Republican Party more generally may not be fully prepared for what is at stake in November.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump and Republican leaders will receive credit for the legislative accomplishment of tax cuts and for taking steps toward de-escalation of tensions with North Korea. This may benefit GOP candidates for the House and Senate.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But these accomplishments may just as easily get lost in the large set of problems facing the Republican Party, including seemingly unending turnover at the White House and in the president’s cabinet, along with inaction on the increasingly important issues of health care reform and gun violence prevention.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Ultimately, if Democrats are to retake the House in November, they must turn to the moderate center once again.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Democrats have a major opportunity to build on Lamb’s strong performance in Pennsylvania and potentially flip seats nationwide. Above all, this will require a strategy that attracts, rather than divides, voters and presents an effective alternative to the current Republican Congress.

Time to drive a stake through heart of ObamaCare,"While the debacle known as ObamaCare has been superseded for the moment by the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and the fireworks in the GOP presidential race, the political battle to repeal this law will continue. Pushed through against popular will by using obscure parliamentary tricks and dispensing old-fashioned “favors” with key lawmakers, ObamaCare has been an unmitigated disaster rife with price hikes, website crashes, lost coverage and corruption.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The American public’s reaction to ObamaCare has been loud and clear, as it has led to two cycles of Republican sweeps at the congressional level. That’s because few things are as personal and cherished to Americans as health care.                
                

            
                President Obama’s notorious untruth “if you like your plan you can keep it” became painfully evident to millions of Americans when they got cancellation letters from their insurance companies. Changing plans, increased bureaucracy and regulation also meant that many Americans could no longer keep the doctor they like, despite President Obama’s repeated assurances that they could.                
                

            
                Eye-popping premium hikes for millions of Americans are another shocking result of the so-called “affordable” care act. The on-coming “ObamaCare sticker shock” will be hitting customers with an average of 18 percent higher premiums. Insurers in many states are seeking increases of 20 percent to 30 percent and, in one case, even 60 percent. The evidence continues to mount that this law is hitting millions of Americans hard in their pocket books, at the same time it has turned their health care coverage upside-down.                
                

            
                No wonder that over the past six years, when President Obama first hatched this scheme, literally hundreds of polls have never shown a majority of public support for ObamaCare.                
                

            
                The state exchanges ObamaCare created have revealed another ugly aspect of the law – an opportunity for corruption. Oregon’s state exchange – Cover Oregon – should be the poster child.                
                

            
                Then-Gov. John Kitzhaber proclaimed that the exchange was to be the model of progressive health care dreams. Kitzhaber, a doctor by training, was ObamaCare’s staunchest defender. But Kitzhaber has resigned in disgrace and now faces potential indictment for allowing his fianceé to use state resources for her consulting clients. As the Washington Times, The Oregonian and local newspapers like the Willamette Week have reported, he allowed the exchanges to be run by his campaign operatives rather than by IT or other professionals.                
                

            
                The Wilmette Week reported in April, “Kitzhaber handed oversight of the Cover Oregon mess to a secretive campaign consultant who liked to call herself the Princess of Darkness. By her own admission, Patricia McCaig knew virtually nothing about health care reform or the reasons Cover Oregon had crashed. Her primary mission was not to save a beleaguered state program, but to get Kitzhaber re-elected. Emails that Kitzhaber’s office tried to delete from state computers show McCaig was effectively in charge of all decision-making for Cover Oregon beginning in February 2014.”                
                

            
                State officials who refused to toe the line were bullied by the campaign hacks. When she refused to go along with the company line, one official -- Carolyn Lawson -- was told, “You will be resigning today. It’s going to be for personal reasons. You can write the resignation letter or we can write it for you,” according to news reports. Lawson is now suing the state.                
                

            
                Most egregious is that after spending more than $300 million in taxpayer dollars received from the federal government, Kitzhaber’s campaign operatives decided to simply abandon the state exchange and join the federal exchange. The move came after Kitzhaber was told that it was close to operational, but polls showed it was a liability.                
                

            
                According to the Washington Times, “Evidence from official documents gathered by congressional investigators or obtained under open records laws suggests Mr. Kitzhaber’s aides applied pressure to kill the project even though the governor had been told the exchange could be fixed and made operational.”                
                

            
                The malfeasance by elected officials and political operatives involved in one of these state exchanges underscores the disastrousness of ObamaCare. With spiraling costs, lost coverage and corrupt exchanges, it’s time to find a way to drive a stake through the heart of this disastrous program.

"After the First GOP Debate, Team Obama Should Be Taking Notes","One thing is clear from the first presidential debate for the GOP candidates--at least of the ones who chose to be there--President Obama's days are numbered.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                With only five of the declared candidates for the GOP nomination in attendance, and notably a weaker field in terms of name recognition, gravitas, and moxy, the ninety minutes went by with a surprising amount of substance being diligently discussed.                
                

            
                In other words facts, issues, circumstances, and policies will not be merely side shows in the 2012 campaign. And if the second tier candidates realize this in spades, imagine how the more forceful candidates, or potential candidates will add to the chorus that was clearly begun tonight: ""President Obama has been a disaster and it's time to choose a different direction.""                
                

            
                Kudos to Bret Baier and Team Washington from Fox News for pouring substance into just about every question asked. Chris Wallace, Shannon Bream, and Juan Williams asked pointed, direct questions, and pressed for direct answers.                 
                

            
                Though pressing wasn't all that necessary given how eagerly and transparently the participants put forward their ideas.
On style, smoothness, preparedness, and performance many will give the win on the debate to former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty. He communicated well, handled a variety of issues to the general liking of most conservatives and on the question that would likely hurt him the most--a Chris Wallace query on seemingly conflicting positions on cap and trade legislation--he was candid and humble. A lesson the current President could learn much from.                
                

            
                Senator Rick Santorum gave what the GOP has come to expect from him, knowledgeable answers, an emphasis on the dangers posed by Iran, and the champion fighter for all things of social and moral values. Santorum was particularly effective in linking social values issues to the very core definition and belief of what it means to be, uniquely, American.                
                

            
                Ron Paul was the libertarian crank, and as expected--denouncing the fed, calling for it's end, denouncing all extraneous military action taking place across the global war on terror, giving his approval to gay marriage, prostitution, and of course, the attempt to legalize heroin.                
                

            
                Gary Johnson came off as whiny, a poor sport, and pretty much a one note pony somewhat incapable of moving off the topic of ""cost benefit"" analysis.                
                

            
                Businessman and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain came off effective and winsome, perhaps the surprise of the night--especially for people that had not heard from him previously.                
                

            
                A first of sorts in the format was the opportunity to rebuff potential or declared candidates who did not show for the proceedings. Tim Pawlenty was asked early on about the albatross that will dog Gov. Romney every day he is in the race--the failure of Romney-care that in essence served as the blueprint for Obamacare. Pawlenty deftly side-stepped criticizing Romney directly while going on to destroy the very definition of the health care reform plans of both RomneyCare and ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Herman Cain was asked about his endorsement of Governor Romney in 2008, in his response he cited Romney's business abilities and prowess to create jobs, but went on to say that the Governor had lost in 2008 and now it was his time as a businessman to bring new effort to the fight.                
                

            
                Ron Paul dissed Michele Bachmann, Gary Johnson got in stabs at both Donald Trump and Sarah Palin while trying to fill time in coming up with an answer to the question of what his reality show would look like.                
                

            
                And Tim Pawlenty surprisingly uttered, ""I LOVE THE HUCK!"" He was equally effusive about Governor Huckabee's wife, family, and former opportunities to work together on issues as governors.                
                

            
                The truth is that none of the candidates in this debate will be president in 2013. But from their status as strong bench players for the team that is still largely on the sidelines, they put in a tremendous performance on articulating answers to the biggest challenges facing us, and when these debates start happening with the ""starters"" on the field, Team Obama had better be taking notes.                
                

            
                As Herman Cain revealed--the one decision of taking down Bin Ladin, will not be the totality of the presidential argument. And as all of the candidates indicated--economic recovery not yet realized makes America weaker by the day.                
                

            
                So notice has been served, the journey begun, and the incumbent--coming off his biggest win in office to date--is back to playing defense.

              Do people who are overweight or obese deserve health care? In the United Kingdom's socialized health care system, the answer appears to be ""no."" And if Democrats get their way, the same could be true in the United States.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To save money, the U.K. National Health Service recently announced it will ban obese patients from many surgeries for up to a year. Such rationing is standard in single-payer health care systems. Americans will face the same fate if Democrats can enact Medicare for All here. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., recently introduced his Medicare for All bill backed by 15 other Democratic senators. His call to create such a single-payer health care system was a major part of his failed campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care. 
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              In addition, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is urging Democrats to make single-payer a centerpiece of their upcoming campaigns.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Known as ""lifestyle rationing,"" the new British policy debunks the myth that single-payer systems deliver truly universal health care.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The rule applies to patients with a body mass index of 30 or higher. It would hit a 5-foot-10 man who weighs more than 209 pounds, or a 5-foot-4 woman who weighs more than 174 pounds. These patients will have to wait a year, or lose 10 percent of their weight, before they can receive elective surgeries like hip or knee replacements.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              The National Health Service in Britain believes such discriminatory rationing is the ""best way of achieving maximum value from the limited resources available.""
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Of course, overweight people aren't the only ones denied care in single-payer systems. The bureaucrats who run them have little choice but to ration care for everyone.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              When patients pay virtually nothing for health care, they have little incentive to limit their consumption. If someone feels even slightly under the weather, he or she can immediately go to the doctor and demand medicine, rather than simply rest up and hydrate. So patients flood doctor's offices and hospitals.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              With no market forces at work to regulate demand, the only way for the government to keep costs under control is to forcibly limit the supply of medical services.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Single-payer systems do so by offering doctors and hospitals relatively paltry sums for their services. The average general practitioner in the United Kingdom earns about $130,000 per year. By contrast, a general practitioner in America earns over $200,000 annually, on average.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This combination of lower pay and seemingly limitless demand for care is causing many British doctors to leave the medical field – or go elsewhere to practice. There are 7,000 fewer doctors in the United Kingdom today than in 2005. In just the first month of this year, nearly 300 doctors applied for certificates to work overseas.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In addition, fewer medical students are completing their educations. In 2016, half of junior doctors left the National Health Service after their first two years of training. That is an abrupt increase from 2011, when less than three in ten junior doctors exited.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As a result, the National Health Service is in the midst of an unprecedented staffing shortage. More than 30,600 positions are currently vacant. Almost 40 percent of those openings are for nurses and midwives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So patients wait. More than 4 million are standing by for surgery – the highest figure in a decade.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The single-payer system in Canada is hardly better, particularly for patients seeking specialist care. According to the Fraser Institute, the median wait time between referral from a general practitioner and treatment by a specialist in 2016 was 20 weeks – the longest on record.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              America's own experiment with single-payer – the Veterans Health Administration in the Department of Veterans Affairs – is a national embarrassment. A federal investigation found that more than 200 veterans died while waiting for care at a Phoenix VA facility in 2015. The same is true of almost 100 veterans at a Los Angeles VA hospital between October 2014 and August 2015.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These horror stories are worth remembering now that the apparent failure of the GOP's health care reform effort has revived calls for single-payer in the United States.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Some U.S. doctors appear to be falling in line behind liberal icons Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. According to a new survey from Merritt Hawkins, a physician recruiting firm, 42 percent of doctors strongly support single-payer. Fourteen percent are somewhat supportive.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Supporters of single-payer health care should realize the error of their ways, because single-payer isn't a shortcut to universal health care. As the experiences of other countries prove, it's a pathway to grotesque rationing, long waiting lines and needless suffering.

                I will never forget the mom who approached me at a congressional field hearing on education in Cleveland years ago.
 
 “Mr. Congressman, I need your help,” she said. “Five years ago I wanted to enroll my son in a different school because the school he was assigned to was terrible. School officials told me, ‘don’t worry, we have a five-year plan to fix the school.’ Congressman, it’s now five years later, the school is worse than it ever was, and I still can’t enroll my son in another school. Now all I hear is, ‘We have a new five-year plan.’ Mr. Congressman, if I can’t get my son into a school that works I will lose my son.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                I went numb. There was nothing I could do. Nothing she could do.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                I often think of that mom and her son. She had no immediate recourse for holding a failed government school accountable.                
                

            
                Much of the public similarly believes that ""government accountability” is an oxymoron, that it just doesn’t exist.
 
 They see the long lines at TSA checkpoints, ObamaCare websites that don’t work, and economic policies that drive up unemployment. There is no simple process for citizens to demand better service from their government.
 
 Contrast that with the free market, where consumers have a say.
 
 Millions of Target’s shoppers are holding the retail giant accountable for its massive data breach. They're shopping elsewhere. Target competes daily with other big box stores on price, quality, and service, and they know that their customers have a choice.
 
 Consumers hold auto dealers accountable for bad experiences by choosing to shop elsewhere.
 
 Restaurants know that unhappy customers have choices.
 
 Choices abound in the free market. Choice creates real and immediate accountability.
 
 It is why government’s “customers” are so palpably exasperated with the government monopoly on so many products and services that impact our lives. They often have nowhere else to turn.
 
 Any customer of government – whether it’s with education, taxes, housing, or health care – understands the frustrations when they have a bad experience. They're stuck and can't go anywhere else.
 
 They also see that government does not hold itself accountable. Unacceptable performance is tolerated indefinitely. Nobody loses their job over such failures as ObamaCare websites, Benghazi, the IRS targeting certain groups for extra scrutiny, or the Justice Department spying on reporters.
 
 Citizens have only have one recourse: voting elected officials out of office. It is extremely difficult to hold lawmakers accountable – especially in the House with tightly drawn congressional districts designed to benefit incumbents – and elections are held on a predetermined schedule once every two (House members), four (presidents) and six (senators) years.
 
 It is not immediate or easy, but voters ultimately do have the final say.
 
 Short of success at the ballot box here is a simple blueprint for implementing better accountability in government.
 
 First, whenever possible, products and services should be delivered in free market environments and not by government. Consumer accountability drives quality and efficiency.
 
 Second, where it is unavoidable that government provides goods and services such as with schools and public transportation, private sector competition to government delivery systems should be facilitated.

                Health care reform is probably the best and most recent example of where less government rather than more government would have resulted in the best possible outcome.                
                

            
                Finally, when there are no alternatives to government-driven products and services, strong leadership at government’s highest levels should demand that “the public – our customer – will be served. Any failure to meet that standard, or failure to meet the highest ethical and criminal standards, will result in heads rolling.”
 
 I want to be able to tell that mom in Cleveland, and other government customers around America, “Government is in the business of customer service, and you have the tools to hold it accountable.""

                President Obama recently sat down for a long, wide-ranging interview with Thomas Friedman, the New York Times’ premier columnist and multiple Pulitzer Prize winner. It was supposed to be an elevated discussion between two intellectuals about the weighty foreign policy issues not just of the day, but of the modern era. Obama kept referring to broad, sweeping words of wisdom – the deal with Iran is a “once in a lifetime” chance. He hinted at a similar deal with Cuba.

                And he announced, “You asked about an Obama doctrine. The doctrine is: We will engage, but we preserve all our capabilities.”

                It was vintage Obama – vague, but important sounding. It could mean whatever you wanted it to mean. Anyone could read into it what he wanted. It would mean all things to all people. It was a Rorschach test: How you interpreted it depended more on what you thought than what he said. It was complete gobbledygook.                
                

            
                The Obama administration has spent six years in search of a doctrine worthy of the Chosen One. At first it was “Leading from Behind.” But that didn’t work, because rather than take our cue, others rushed to fill the void created by our withdrawal from the front of the pack.                
                

            
                Then it was “don’t do stupid stuff.” But the administration kept doing stupid stuff, like the premature withdrawal from Iraq that gave birth to ISIS, or the Libyan war that left the country in jihadi chaos, or the decision to blame the Benghazi terrorist attacks on an obscure YouTube video.                
                

            
                More recently, the Obama administration claimed its doctrine was “strategic patience” and made references to the great arc of history bending in our direction. But that’s like saying – even though the world seems to be “exploding all over,” to quote former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel – don’t worry, everything will turn out well in the end. It’s basing America’s national security on “fingers crossed.”                
                

            
                The president talks in every speech about the “global community” and the “rules-based international community.” He puts his faith in the creation of new entities based on common interests and shared values to deal with everything from governing the Internet to global warming. He believes that if America takes a step back, other nations will step forward and planetary kumbaya will ensue.                 
                

            
                Sadly, we have seen that the alternative to American leadership isn’t world peace, but rising regional hegemonies – or even worse, chaos. China, Russia, Iran and the Islamic State don’t want to play by our rules. They want to kick over the global chessboard and establish their own rules.                
                

            
                Previous attempts at an Obama Doctrine had come from White House aides or Cabinet officers, but in his interview with Friedman Obama himself took a turn at defining the Obama Doctrine. Doubtless, it was focus-group tested and designed to offend the fewest people. It sounds like we want to stay involved in world affairs, but not expend too much effort. It’s so vacuous, it’s meaningless.                
                

            
                Compare this to James Monroe’s doctrine that great powers should stay out of our hemisphere, or Theodore Roosevelt’s “speak softly and carry a big stick,” or Ronald Reagan’s Peace through Strength. Those were unambiguous. They made clear that we did not seek war, but we would remain strong enough to defend ourselves if necessary.                
                

            
                President Obama is about to get his nuclear deal with Iran, which he believes will be the crowning achievement of his historic, transformational presidency. Yet wise and respected diplomats like former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, who are no strangers to historic treaties, have warned that the agreement will not do what he has promised. Instead of preventing a nuclear arms race, it will have the opposite effect, and nuclear weapons will spread throughout the Middle East.                
                

            
                President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are in search of greatness. The president will sign an agreement with Iran on behalf of the United States but without the concurrence of its elected representatives. In effect, that allows Iran to get nuclear weapons and ignites a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.                
                

            
                Presumably, the president believes that if he grants Iran this right, its leaders will have a sudden change of heart on their terrorist ways, stop chanting “death to America” and abandon their goal of “annihilating Israel.”                
                

            
                But if he is wrong, he has just bet America’s security, and the world’s, on an agreement that can neither be adequately verified nor successfully enforced with a handful of messianic mullahs who are convinced they’ve been chosen to rule the world.                
                

            
                If so, others will write the Obama Doctrine, and it won’t be pretty. President Obama will be known as the man who allowed nuclear weapons into the Middle East in exchange for one vainglorious moment.                 
                

            
                In 1938 British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain traveled to Munich to sign a pact with Adolph Hitler. Chamberlain returned to London to cheers, parades and congratulations, declaring he had achieved “peace in our time.” A year later, however, the very war he’d been seeking to avoid had begun. Chamberlain’s naiveté and appeasement policy were blamed for one of the world’s most devastating and destructive wars. The threats we face today are even more ominous -- Hitler never got his hands on nuclear weapons.                
                

            
                If, in a few years, the Middle East is awash in nuclear materials and weapons of mass destruction, the likelihood they will be used will go up exponentially – whether they’re used intentionally, accidentally or even inadvertently. If so, the blame will fall squarely on Obama’s shoulders. Chamberlain’s capitulation and folly will look minor compared to his.                
                

            
                Then we will finally have an explanation of the Obama Doctrine. President Obama’s legacy will not be “peace in our time.” It will be introducing nuclear weapons into the most unstable and dangerous part of the planet into the hands of people who will not hesitate to use them."
"Juan Williams: On health care, Senate Republicans determined to ignore warning signs of political derailment","Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and on TheHill.com.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                How times have changed on ObamaCare.
                
                


                
            
                A Kaiser Family Foundation poll late last month found that 49 percent of Americans have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as ObamaCare is officially called, while 42 percent have an unfavorable view. That is the highest level of support the poll has found for the law since the summer of 2010.
                
                


                
            
                And then there is the GOP failure to find a palatable substitute.
                
                


                
            
                Kaiser found that just eight percent of the public think the Senate should pass the GOP House bill being advanced to replace ObamaCare, a bill the Senate is using as the basis for its health care reform plan.
                
                


                
            
                Even President Trump on a visit to Capitol Hill last week reportedly told Republican senators that he doesn’t like the House GOP’s American Health Care Act (AHCA) because it is “mean.”
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Seeing Trump jump off the House plan is a very bad sign for Congressional Republicans as they get ready to talk health care with constituents over coming recesses around Independence Day and in August. Even when the president was celebrating the House bill, Republicans faced unruly Memorial Day town hall meetings, with outright protests against their health care proposal.
                
                


                
            
                But Senate Republicans are betting they can do reconstructive surgery on the framework of the unpopular House plan — which the Congressional Budget Office concludes will take insurance away from 23 million people — by making the House bill less “mean.”
                
                


                
            
                They are reported to be looking at increasing subsidies for the poor while providing more time to achieve the far-right goal of doing away with federal guarantees of Medicaid funds to pay medical bills for the poor. The GOP Senate majority also may include special grants to areas hard hit by opioid addiction.
                
                


                
            
                None of this is being done in public hearings. The Congressional Budget Office has not been given a proposal to score. No committees have met.
                
                


                
            
                Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is keeping his caucus on board this night train ride by promising bright days ahead. The dawn will bring tax reform that will cut taxes for the rich – another promise the GOP wants to keep ahead of the 2018 midterms. But they can only get there once passage of a health care deal is in the rearview mirror.
                
                


                
            
                So Senate Republicans steam ahead on this night train despite red lights warning of political derailment. Their proposals have not been vetted by their own caucus, the health care industry or their constituents.
                
                


                
            
                The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page buys into the McConnell strategy. It contends the big players know what is in the Senate bill. Also, the paper views Democrats as insincere on the grounds that nothing will please liberal critics except renewal of ObamaCare.
                
                


                
            
                Well, the proof will be in the bill.
                
                


                
            
                Let’s see if the GOP can put a plan before the public that provides medical insurance to more people than ObamaCare and lowers premiums; that offers protections for people with pre-existing conditions; that pays bills for mental health, maternity and drug problems; that does away with yearly and lifetime caps on spending; and that protects young people from being prematurely pushed off of their parents’ plans.
                
                


                
            
                To be clear, it isn’t all 52 Senate Republicans who are on board for these secret negotiations. A working group of 13 arch-conservative men led by McConnell got tickets to ride.
                
                


                
            
                Noticeably not on board are female GOP senators, including the most senior Republican woman in the Senate, Susan Collins of Maine, who has a background as a state insurance regulator. Also excluded was South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, who made his fortune as an insurance executive in the Palmetto State.
                
                


                
            
                This lack of diversity is important because smoke signals coming from the GOP’s private talks appear to include changes to health care law that will disproportionately harm the poor, the elderly, women and people of color.
                
                


                
            
                Polls show the public consistently rejecting the House plan. A Quinnipiac poll earlier this month found 62 percent of voters disapprove of the House bill while just 17 percent approve of it.
                
                


                
            
                Quinnipiac also found that 30 percent of voters say Trump and Congress should not repeal any part of ObamaCare. And 47 percent said they should repeal only some parts of it.
                
                


                
            
                Meanwhile, Democrats are rushing into the town square in advance of the 2018 elections pointing to rising support for ObamaCare. And they are damning the Republicans with charges of hypocrisy.
                
                


                
            
                They point to then-House Republican Leader John Boehner’s (Ohio) epic rant before the Democrats’ pushed through ObamaCare on a party-line vote in 2010.
                
                


                
            
                “Look at how this bill was written,” Boehner fumed. “Can you say it was done openly, with transparency and accountability, without backroom deals struck behind closed doors, hidden from the people? Hell, no you can’t! Have you read the bill? …Hell, no you haven’t! ...Shame on this body!”
                
                


                
            
                But the Republicans of 2017 roll along, even though they are open to the very same charges.
                
                


                
            
                Even if the Senate bill gets 50 votes once the deal is public, it will still have to survive a conference committee with the House Freedom Caucus hardliners.
                
                


                
            
                Is it any wonder the Senate Republicans want to keep their plan secret?

As an undocumented Latino with several citizen relatives, this is not enough for my family.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                According to the Center for American Progress’ 2012 report, there are 11 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and 16.6 million families who have at least one undocumented member.                 
                

            
                On the right, poll numbers spike whenever Donald Trump or any GOP candidate takes an anti-immigrant stance. But the GOP's xenophobia is still less shameful than the Democrat candidates’ reluctance to support a far ranging pro-immigrant platform.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            Secretary Clinton can’t be, and isn’t, for our community while denying health care to our parents and deporting our kids.

                Secretary Hillary Clinton, the current front-runner and presumed nominee, is the most culpable of this inaction. She promoted a policy to restrict immigrant access to health care and a college education. She failed to lean in when CNN host Anderson Cooper brought up her unfavorable positions, denying federal subsidies for undocumented immigrants in the Affordable Care Act Exchange and deferring to states’ discretion on the issue of in-state tuition for undocumented students.                 
                

            
                When given an opportunity, she displayed a lack of leadership for Latinos and the larger immigrant populations affected by our broken immigration system including thousands of immigrants from Asia and Africa.

                As chair of Task Force on National Health Care Reform, Hillary Clinton once argued that all Americans deserve health care. It’s disappointing she now believes immigrants don’t deserve affordable and quality health care.                 
                

            
                At a town hall in Nevada this summer, Secretary Clinton argued that all children should have “the best chance to do well in school.” We expected continued leadership on our education, not a cop-out to states’ rights when it comes to college.                 
                

            
                Hillary’s current position on in-state tuition is similar to what she said about gay marriage as recently as 2006, in which she claimed it should be up to the states, before doing a further flop as presidential candidate to fully support it.                 
                

            
                Keep in mind this is also the same Secretary Clinton that advocated for the mass deportation of unaccompanied minors from Central America, despite legal groups saying virtually all of them would be eligible for some form of humanitarian relief.                 
                

            
                Secretary Clinton can’t be, and isn’t, for our community while denying health care to our parents and deporting our kids.                
                

            
                The rest of the candidates had an opportunity to distinguish themselves but largely failed to capitalize it. Senator Webb himself lost a good opportunity by bringing up the border without addressing the needless deaths and rampant misconduct by Border Patrol.                 
                

            
                Senator Sanders, considered the most ""left"" by many, was relegated to defending his 2007 vote against immigration reform. If he were truly passionate on this issue, then he would have turned it around and explained what specific executive actions he would take as president, such as expanding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, promoting in-state tuition for all states, and expanding Affordable Care Act coverage to all regardless of citizenship status.                 
                

            
                Governor O’Malley was the only standout, as he recounted passing the Maryland Dream Act and forcefully made a case for expanding the Affordable Care Act to include undocumented immigrants not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because it makes economic sense for health insurance rates.                
                

            
                This contest is still in its early stages but candidates, and the Democratic Party itself, are still not doing enough. We remember the failure of the DREAM Act in 2010, the millions of deportations under President Obama, and see the campaign money candidates are receiving from private detention centers.                 
                

            
                It’s no longer enough to be left of Republicans — now it’s time to lead.

"No, Mr. Obama, it's not sexism that's turning the tide against Hillary Clinton","Now Playing                            Obama blames sexism for close presidential race                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                President Obama blames sexism for Hillary Clinton’s tight presidential race. But that’s not the “ism” that’s holding her back. Donald Trump has opened an eight-point advantage over Clinton on which candidate is honest and trustworthy, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News Tracking Poll. “Truthism” — defined as the voters’ preference for candidates who tell the truth and obey the law — is interfering with Hillary’s plan to become the first woman president.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Obama suggests it’s time. No argument there. But Hillary’s not the one to make history. Voters need to remember her history. She’s gotten where she is by riding her husband’s coattails … and by lying. Electing Hillary Clinton would validate the wrong ways to get ahead. It would endanger our nation’s precious heritage: the rule of law.                
                

            
                Hillary resembles Eva Peron more than a pioneering feminist like Susan B. Anthony or Elizabeth Cady Stanton.                
                

            
                On the campaign trail, as Hillary vows to “crack every last glass ceiling” and win equality for women, she often invokes her supposed struggles to become the first female partner at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas. What’s the real story? She got that law job in — surprise — 1977, just after hubby Bill Clinton was sworn in as the state’s attorney general. She was catapulted to partner two years later, when Bill was sworn in as governor.

                Fast forward to 1993. Newly inaugurated President Bill Clinton announced a Task Force on National Health Care Reform and made Hillary the chair. This was his wife’s big moment, but she insisted on keeping secret the names of her advisers, barred the public and press from her task force meetings and presented an entire revamp of the nation’s health care system to Congress without even getting the lawmakers’ input. Her arrogance set back the cause of health reform for many years.                
                

            
                Then, in 2000, Hillary spotted another chance to capitalize on her husband’s position. She moved to New York, where she had never lived or worked, and ran for the U.S. Senate, rolling over any locals who might have sought the nomination. Chuck Schumer took pains to deny the obvious on election night, declaring “she won this election not because she was first lady, but because she worked hard.” Right.                
                

            
                After an unremarkable stint as New York’s senator and a failed presidential bid in 2008, Hillary took the consolation prize of secretary of state in 2009. Four years later, she left the State Department in shambles, according to numerous Inspector General reports, with diplomatic posts unsecured, $6 billion unaccounted for and the department’s official records missing.                
                

            
                Hillary is in hot water with the FBI because, as secretary of state, she conducted all her business on a private email system, shunning the government system that is subject to oversight and Freedom of Information Act requests. She even sent and received classified information on that private, easily hacked system, which put the nation’s security at risk. And after leaving office, she dodged requests for her records. Instead, she destroyed thousands of emails and smashed as many as 13 computers and handheld devices.                
                

            
                The details of the FBI’s ongoing investigation of her private email system are complex, but everybody who’s ever worked knows that when you leave a job, you don’t destroy the records and smash your computer. Honest people don’t have to do that.                
                

            
                Why did she? Some have speculated that she was hiding a pay-to-play scheme where the Clintons raked in multimillion-dollar gifts to their foundation and megabucks speaking fees for Bill Clinton in return for access to the secretary of state. News leaked this week that the FBI is conducting an extensive investigation into the Clinton Foundation.                
                

            
                Hillary is also under investigation for perjury and obstruction of justice by the House of Representatives. She’s even in legal hot water in her new hometown, Chappaqua, N.Y., for renovating her house without getting the required permits from town hall. Just one more example of why she’s surrounded by scandal. She thinks laws are for the little people. She doesn’t have to obey them.                
                

            
                Clinton’s disdain for the law and her sense of entitlement are finally catching up with her. Women who make it on their own know that these attitudes can torpedo a career. President Obama is trying to tell voters that sexism is to blame for their reluctance to vote for Hillary. Don’t believe it.

                Hillary Clinton and her supporters are basking in the glow of what they believe was her shining performance in the first Democratic debate, but she—and they—should beware when the spotlight turns to the whopper of a lie she told on stage.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Clinton said, “I'm a progressive who likes to get things done. And I know how to find common ground, and I know how to stand my ground, and I have proved that in every position that I've had, even dealing with Republicans who never had a good word to say about me, honestly.”                 
                

            
                Pull out the fact checkers when Hillary Clinton uses the word “honestly.”                
                

            
                Honestly, Hillary shape shifts between describing herself as a progressive and a moderate depending on who she thinks she needs to pander to on a given day. For example, at a Women for Hillary event in Ohio last month, Clinton said, ""You know, I get accused of being kind of moderate and center. I plead guilty."" Yet in the recent Democratic debate and in a previous campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton averred, “I take a backseat to no one when you look at my record in standing up and fighting for progressive values.”

                Behind a backseat is an exhaust pipe and it is exhausting to keep track of how often Clinton has flip-flopped and not stood her ground regarding “progressive values,” as Politico’s Jack Shafer pointed out after the debate.                
                

            
                “She has reversed her positions on gay marriage, immigration, gun control, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, mass incarceration and the Iraq War, and some believe her recent stand on the Keystone XL pipeline constitutes a flip, too.”                
                

            
                In addition to flip-flopping, Clinton has proved herself to be a Cirque du Soleil contortionist about being honest and trustworthy regarding the rest of her debate declaration.                
                

            
                Clinton may like to get things done but she is inexperienced and ineffective at getting things done well. She is particularly bad at finding “common ground.” Here is a partial list of her failures throughout her career:                
                

            
                · When she was first lady, her husband, Bill, tasked her with health care reform. She proceeded to run her task force in secret and produce a 1,324-page blueprint that was so riddled with unpopular government mandates, coercion and bureaucracy that even a Democratic-controlled Congress wouldn’t vote on it. The debacle of “Hillarycare” helped lead to the 1994 Republican takeover of both the House and Senate for the first time since the 83rd Congress of 1953-1954.                
                

            
                ·  In the Huffington Post, here is how columnist Adam Hanft described Clinton’s record as a U.S. senator from New York: “When she talks about ‘sponsoring’ and ‘introducing’ and ‘fighting for’ legislation that obviously hasn't passed, that's a smokescreen for failure. For many of the bills she introduced, she couldn't even get a cosponsor in her own party!” Hanft goes on to give seven examples of Clinton’s inability to muster even a single Democratic cosponsor for her bills (let alone a Republican) on topics like terrorism, crime, health care and energy. Hanft concluded, “It's a track record of legislative failure and futility.”                
                

            
                ·  As secretary of state, Clinton took charge of a series of “resets” that proved to be upsets with catastrophic consequences. There was the “Russian reset” that “began with the Obama administration’s reneging on a pre-existing American commitment to supply defensive technology to shield Poland and the Czech Republic from missile attacks [which] left both countries vulnerable to pressures and threats from Russia” and continued with Russia’s bloody annexation of Crimea. Under Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama, there were interventionist “resets” in Egypt and Libya that “led to Islamic extremists’ taking over in Egypt and terrorist chaos in [Benghazi] Libya, where the American ambassador was killed, along with three other Americans.” Look at Iran, Syria, China, North Korea and at our ally, Israel—indeed, look anywhere worldwide. Name one instance of Clinton accomplishing anything of significance to mitigate the spread of terrorism, stop the slaughter of Christians and Jews, and make America safer.                
                

            
                Speaking of her deleted emails and private server when she was secretary of state, Clinton said, “I’ve gone longer and farther to try to be as transparent as possible. Nobody else has done that.”                
                

            
                Transparent? Trustworthy? Truthful? Accomplished? None other than New York’s Democratic Senator, Chuck Schumer, put it this way: “She is the most opaque person you will ever meet in your life.”                
                

            
                Is that who we want as America’s commander in chief—as the leader of the free world?

ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In the modern era, two presidents have tackled immigration reform. They were Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush—both conservatives. Plenty of liberal presidents have come and gone, but failed to champion immigration reform. Consider Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama – nada! In fact, to make matters worse, President Obama leveraged the issue in 2008 to win over Hispanics. But then, once elected, he broke his promise, shattering the dreams of many hardworking immigrants.                
                

            
                While working in the White House for President George W. Bush, I saw first-hand his unwavering commitment to achieving a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform and his leadership in the pursuit of it, even when it was politically unpopular with some members of his own party. In contrast, President Obama did not even try to work with leaders from both parties to fix our broken immigration system despite the fact that he enjoyed the benefits of working with a Democrat-controlled Congress during his first two years in the White House.                
                

            
                President Bush’s marching orders were clear. We held weekly meetings with a bipartisan coalition of groups from various sectors, including the business, agriculture, civil rights, and religious communities. We listened, collected their input, and shared our ideas with them. President Bush sent two of his Cabinet Secretaries to Capitol Hill to help draft legislation; and he was the only president ever to deliver a national address on immigration from the Oval Office. Now that is commitment.                
                

            
                President Obama often says that he is ”committed to immigration reform,” but saying those words repeatedly don’t make it so. Let. Me. Be. Clear: President Obama has not drafted any immigration reform legislation. When he says those words, what he really means is ”I am committed to it, so Congress now you go and do it.” That is not leadership; and that does not get important issues moving in Congress.                
                

            
                Immigration reform is a complicated issue; as such, it requires both leadership and commitment from the Executive. The President’s excuse for his inaction is that no Republicans would vote for his plan. What plan? You cannot vote on legislation that does not exist. News flash: speeches alone don’t cut it.                
                

            
                Remember when he told us, during a May 2008 interview with Univision’s Jorge Ramos that “…what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I’m promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.”                
                

            
                Well, even though the President had a veto-proof Congress for the first two years of his term  -- more than 700 days with a majority of Democrats in the House and Senate who could have helped him pass immigration reform – he did nothing. Instead, he ignored the dire state of our economy and his promise to reform immigration, pushing through his health care law.                
                

            
                Why did he ignore his promise to our community? At best, we might conclude that he couldn’t get enough votes from his own party. After all, there are Democrats who don’t support immigration reform because unions oppose a guest worker program. At worst, Obama wasn’t committed to getting it done, figuring he could blame the Republicans and demonize them with Hispanics.                
                

            
                Now let’s compare President Obama’s lackadaisical approach to immigration reform with his push for a health care law. He cared so much about health care reform that he helped craft legislation, campaigned for its passage, and negotiated with elected officials to garner their support. Now that is commitment.                
                

            
                Confronted with his broken promise and an impending election, the President decided, just five months before the 2012 presidential elections, to issue an executive order allowing for a temporary, pseudo-DREAM Act. I agree that this unilateral measure is indeed beneficial to the children of undocumented immigrants brought here through no fault of their own. However, if President Obama cared so much about this issue, why didn’t he pass a permanent measure over two years ago when he knew he had the chance? It looks political, it smells political…could it be political?                
                

            
                To top it all off, President Obama has deported more immigrants than any other president in history - 400,000 each year - over 1.4 million people - separating countless families during his presidency.                
                

            
                Now, the president is asking us for four more years with the same promise of post-election immigration reform. In a recent article, the headline reads, “Obama says Latino vote is key to victory, vows immigration reform in 2013.” This deal sounds awfully familiar. Hispanics need to take a closer look at what the president has and has not delivered, and not just what he says.

"Liberal media's love affair with Hillary Clinton, 2016 race has begun","Now Playing                            Hillary on Time's cover? Enough!                                                                                                 
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                It may surprise some conservatives, but Hillary Clinton has always had a prickly relationship with the news media. That relationship reached its nadir during the 2008 campaign, when the press cleared a path for Barack Obama to win the presidency by steamrolling his competitors, including Hillary.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But with Obama out of the picture for 2016, I predict that the media won’t think twice about transferring their affections to Clinton.                 
                

            
                In fact, the media-engineered rehabilitation of Clinton has already begun. This month the Senate Intelligence Committee released its report on the September 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which killed four Americans, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                The bipartisan report placed significant blame on the Obama administration, and in particular Hillary Clinton’s State Department, for ignoring growing threats in Benghazi and numerous requests for enhanced security. The report found that Islamic terrorists, not an obscure anti-Islamic video, as the administration’s claimed, were responsible for the deadly attack.

                But the report contradicts numerous press reports by liberal news outlets.                 
                

            
                A recent seven-thousand-word piece in the New York Times whitewashed Clinton’s role in the 2012 Benghazi scandal.                
                

            
                The piece dismissed strong evidence that the administration failed to respond to repeated warnings and appeals for more security at the U.S. consulate. Hillary’s press office itself couldn’t have mounted a better defense of her botched handling of the attack.                
                

            
                The media has sent other signals that it’s ready to get behind Hillary for president.                 
                

            
                Last year, CNN and NBC were in the process of producing flattering documentaries of Hillary. The networks, both of which portray themselves as straight, non-partisan news organizations, were to air the films just in time to bolster her image in a presidential run. Only a backlash forced them to shut down their projects.                
                

            
                The notion of a pro-Hillary media would surprise her supporters. Some advisers feel she has been scrutinized unfairly her entire career—from her involvement in the Whitewater scandal and her failed attempt at health care reform to her fashion sense.                 
                

            
                Many blame media bias for her squandering a thirty-point lead to a freshman senator in the 2008 primaries.                 
                

            
                In her book ""Notes from the Cracked Ceiling,"" journalist Anne Kornblut writes that feminist scholars “mostly agreed that Clinton had received harsher media treatment than Obama, sometimes in familiar ways—stories about her laugh, dubbed her ‘cackle’ by The New York Times, or about her husband.”                
                

            
                But Hillary’s problem wasn’t that she was a woman or that she was being punished for her husband’s record. It was simply that she was running against Barack Obama, who, at the time, was involved in what author and Fox News contributor Bernard Goldberg aptly described as a “slobbering love affair” with the Fourth Estate.                
                

            
                But with Obama out of the picture, the media will gush and fawn Hillary right into the Oval Office, if they can.                
                

            
                For one thing, the media are just as shrill and liberal as Hillary. We should be past the point of debate over the media’s liberalism.                 
                

            
                But here’s something sobering for any remaining doubters:  A couple of years ago UCLA politics professor Tim Groseclose conducted an empirical study of how different media outlets report political news. He found that “every mainstream national news outlet in the United States has a liberal bias,” and calculated that media bias helps Democratic candidates by as much as ten percentage points in a typical election.                
                

            
                But Hillary is more than just a liberal. She’s also married to the most popular liberal in the country. There will be no shortage of ‘90s Clinton nostalgia in America’s newsrooms in the run-up to 2016. Many in the media will root for her to win just to be able to cover Bill in the White House again.                
                

            
                To be sure, a few enterprising journalists will investigate the Clinton scandals—including, most recently, the Clintons’ dubious money-making ventures, in particular the finances of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.                
                

            
                But most of the media will fall in love with the narrative of Hillary becoming America’s first female president. It’s a milestone most journalists think is long overdue—and it’s a story few will be able to resist.

                Nearly four years ago, voters sent a very powerful message to President Obama and Democrats in Washington by electing a little-known Republican state senator to the so-called “Kennedy seat.” The message then was simple: “we don’t want ObamaCare.”
 
 Then, like now, Democrats in Washington ignored the will of the people, twisting themselves into pretzels to ram this bill through Congress using backroom political maneuvering.
 
 Back then, voters opposed this bill because they didn’t want the federal government taking over something as private and personal as health care coverage. On top of that, ObamaCare levied 18 new job-killing taxes and gutted Medicare for seniors by more than half a trillion dollars.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                [pullquote]
 
 Today, after the catastrophic rollout of the last month, the anti-ObamaCare message has only intensified. It’s more than just a non-functional web site – which is an embarrassment in and of itself, but only the tip of the iceberg.
 
 Now, we are learning that contrary to the promises made by President Obama and his supporters in Congress, Americans who like their current health care plans actually can’t keep it. In fact, millions of Americans across the country have received cancellation letters in the mail telling them their current health plans will soon cease to exist.
 
 Supporters of ObamaCare blatantly misled their constituents with this broken promise. The American people are fed up with this fiasco, and voters are ready to make their voices heard.
 
 But it’s not just President Obama who needs to be held to account. It is also every single Democratic senator and congressman that voted for the health care bill. Without their support, it wouldn’t have happened.
 
 These Democratic legislators are all on the hook. Any attempt to offer legislation to delay implementation or extend the sign-up period is nothing more than a transparent political stunt from an incumbent senator or congressman literally running for their political life.
 
 If they didn’t want this health care plan, they shouldn’t have voted for it and made it the law of the land.
 
 Everyone shares the goal of ensuring that all our people have access to affordable and high quality health care.                  
                

            
                Republicans have a much different view on how we get there.                  
                

            
                We believe health care reform should be left to the individual states so that they can come up with a plan best tailored for their citizens and their needs. What works in New Hampshire or Massachusetts may not work in New Mexico or Nevada, and vice versa.
 
 Instead of a government takeover from D.C., we should let the states experiment and be the “test tubes of democracy” that our Founding Fathers envisioned when they established our country.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, that didn’t happen and our nation now faces the prospect of a nonfunctional health care bill that will destabilize the entire market and lead to higher premiums across the board.
 
 Democrats who voted for this bill may be running for the hills, but they can’t hide forever.

                Has the Tea Party movement become the final casualty of the 2012 elections?                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Here are four signs that the end – or at least a diminished future --may be near for once powerful Tea Party phenomenon that lifted Republicans to a House majority in the 2010 mid-term elections.                
                

            
                The first and most significant sign took place last week.                
                

            
                Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-Ohio) stripped four of the most outspoken Tea Party members of his caucus of key committee assignments. Representatives Justin Amash (R-Michigan) and Tim Huelskamp (R-Kansas) were booted off the House Budget Committee. Reps. Walter Jones (R-North Carolina) and David Schweikert (R-Arizona) were kicked off the House Financial Services Committee.                
                

            
                Speaking on the condition of anonymity, GOP leadership aides said they were removed for “not being team players” and they warned: “You want good things in Congress and to have a good career? Better play along nicely.” Two of the Tea Party’s most visible television messengers, Reps. Allen West of Florida and Joe Walsh of Illinois, also lost their re-election bids in November.                
                

            
                The second sign came in the Senate. Tea Party Kingmaker, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) surprised the political world by announcing that he will be resigning from the United States Senate to become the President of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. DeMint said there is “no question” that he can do more to advance the conservative movement as head of a think tank than as a United States Senator who can introduce, amend, block and vote on federal legislation.                
                

            
                And a third sign of the Tea Party’s lower standing came when the incoming chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Jerry Moran, vowed that his organization will become more involved in senatorial primaries to prevent the nomination of Tea Party candidates who are likely to lose in statewide elections. “I don’t think we have any choice but to work to do things better than what we did, based upon the lack of success that we had.” Moran said.                
                

            
                Moran is obviously referring to the failed campaigns of Tea Party candidates that cost the GOP control of the Senate. Those candidates, backed by DeMint, include Delaware’s Christine O’Donnell, Nevada’s Sharron Angle, Colorado’s Ken Buck, Missouri’s Todd Akin and Indiana’s Richard Mourdock.  Karl Rove, the GOP strategist, has said that he wants to reorient his America Crossroads organization to intervene in primaries because he was “sick and tired of spending money in races where the moderates and the conservatives had gone at each other and made victory impossible.”                
                

            
                And there is one final sign of the Tea Party’s trouble.                
                

            
                Dick Armey, the former Republican House Majority Leader announced his resignation as head of the influential Tea Party group, Freedomworks.                
                

            
                The group was instrumental in pulling together town hall protests against President Obama’s health care reform law in 2009. Politico reports that the organization paid Mr. Armey $8 million in a separation agreement after a disagreement over how who would receive the proceeds from a book deal earlier this year.                 
                

            
                Armey told Politico that “The concern was that the story the press would write was that the whole Tea Party movement was in a state of disarray. That was probably a fairly reality based concern to have, and we wanted the organization to survive and do well and the movement to survive and do well. So that was one of the reasons why we were concerned about me leaving before the election.”                  
                

            
                All of this comes at a time when the Tea Party’s popularity is extremely low. A CNN/ORC poll from last month found that 50 percent of Americans now view the Tea Party movement unfavorably compared to only 32 percent who view them favorably. Tea Party candidates lost 12 of 16 races on Election Day.                
                

            
                While I have been critical of many of the Tea Party’s tactics and its solutions to the problems facing our country, I have always maintained the movement was mostly made up of honest, well-meaning citizens who are rightly concerned about profligate government spending and the national debt.                
                

            
                One of the unfair charges that liberals and the mainstream media made against the Tea Party movement was that they were purely racial in their anger at Obama. It is true the group is overwhelmingly white, older group and some members stray into offensive racial rhetoric. But that is not true of the whole movement and I said so at the time.                
                

            
                The truth is the Tea Party is bigger than anger at this president. When I talk with Tea Party activists they also express strong disappointment with George W. Bush’s policies. They do not like the Bush team’s record-breaking deficits, its embrace of Congressional earmarks and passage of an enormous expansion of Medicare entitlements without funding it. These are the people who opposed the Bush plan for comprehensive immigration reform.                
                

            
                That brand of Conservative activism in national debate is a good thing.  But the already decentralized movement – Tea Party Patriots, Americans for Prosperity, Tea Party Express, and Tea Party Nation -- has become unsustainably fractured and exploited by charlatans and profiteers.                
                

            
                My friend, Bill Kristol, shares this concern and wrote about it in a recent essay for the Weekly Standard:                
                

            
                “Reading about some conservative organizations and Republican campaigns these days, one is reminded of Eric Hoffer’s remark, “Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and eventually degenerates into a racket.”                 
                

            
                It may be that major parts of American conservatism have become such a racket that a kind of ‘re-founding’ of the movement as a cause is necessary.

                Monday is the day open enrollment closes for the majority of the American public and the Obama administration is counting on young people – Millennials – to carry them across the finish line.                                             ADVERTISEMENT

                Earlier this month, he took time to be a guest on the Funny or Die show “Between Two Ferns” and called into Ryan Seacrest's radio program.                 
                

            
                Meanwhile, First Lady Michelle Obama appeared in the “Your Mom Cares” video along with other celebrity moms, urging young people to sign up for ObamaCare.

                One motivation for all this outreach is economic. ObamaCare will work better if young people sign up, because they are relatively healthy. The Obama team wanted youth to vote in 2008 and 2012 and now hopes they will make a financial decision to join the health exchanges.                
                

            
                But the White House would also like young people to support ObamaCare as a policy. That would help the president’s sagging poll numbers, which may be a drag on his party this November. And it would address the really serious and long-term political question, which is what lessons Millennials draw from this era in our history.                
                

            
                As someone who directs and studies the political and civic participation of our nation’s youth, I find that the political orientation of each generation tends to be set in young adulthood.                 
                

            
                The generation that came of age under Franklin D. Roosevelt decided that Herbert Hoover’s minimal government had failed and that federal programs could help them. They formed the New Deal Coalition for half a century and still fight for Social Security today.                 
                

            
                The generation that reached voting age with Ronald Reagan remains skeptical of government and relatively libertarian.                
                

            
                Thus the stakes are very high: the next fifty years of American politics and policy will be strongly influenced by the conclusions that the Millennials derive from the present moment.                
                

            
                In 2008, polls showed them strongly supportive of government action to address issues like health and education. Analyzing polling data going all the way back to the 1960s, we find that Millennials were the most pro-government generation on record, as of 2008.                
                

            
                But it is clear that their enthusiasm has been shaken since then.                 
                

            
                Politics has been an ugly business. Even though many youth would blame Congress more than the president for the bitter stalemate in Washington, it’s still hard to be enthusiastic about a federal program if you despise the institutions that oversee it.                
                

            
                Quite a few Millennials peeled off from the Obama coalition because they stood to the left of the president on the health care bill itself (preferring a single payer system or at least the “public option”), not to mention issues like Afghanistan and the NSA surveillance debate. These young people are not likely to vote Republican unless they are drawn to GOP candidates who stake out strongly civil libertarian positions on issues like surveillance. But their enthusiasm for mainstream Democrats is very much in question.                
                

            
                I have never seen persuasive evidence that media outreach and celebrity appeals can change fundamental opinions about policy and politics. Obama’s visit to “Between Two Ferns” will not be the turning point in the administration’s efforts.                 
                

            
                So what should they do to get young people involved in health reform?                
                

            
                First, they could try to alter the design of ObamaCare to encourage more engagement. Critics say that the Affordable Health Care Act “socializes” medicine, but in fact, individuals must buy their own health insurance plans from private vendors on an exchange, albeit with a subsidy if they qualify.                 
                

            
                You are supposed to sit alone at your computer screen deciding which option is best for you and your family.                 
                

            
                The bill could have been written so that various kinds of organizations and groups could participate together. For instance, unions and churches could have been allowed to enroll, and people could have been given opportunities to found new groups that would sign up together. Then young people would have had the chance to help build organizations.                
                

            
                It is not necessarily too late to change ObamaCare in this direction. In fact, the Affordable Health Care provides $11 billion for community health centers that are governed by local residents. A broad coalition called Health Access California has signed up millions for ObamaCare and also worked on other aspects of public health since 1987. Health Access California was not created by the law but has used it effectively. Few know about these efforts.                
                

            
                If the participatory aspects of the law were strengthened and publicized, many young people would take part and see themselves as agents of change. Our research consistently finds that when Millennials are offered opportunities to address public issues, they step up.                
                

            
                Second, the administration could engage young people to advocate for health care reform. We estimate that in 2008, more than 4 percent of all young adults volunteered for a political campaign--the highest number ever recorded, and higher than the rate for older people that same year.                 
                

            
                Some worked for John McCain or for state and local candidates, but the lion’s share volunteered for Obama. They represented a potential mass movement to support health care reform in Congress and to sign people up for the new program once it was enacted.                
                

            
                But since then, the administration has taken only token efforts to engage these young people. Young voters basically ended up on the email list of Organizing for America, which morphed into Organizing for Action. Neither organization has been a movement or even a space for discussion.                
                

            
                The 2008 Obama campaign was creative and courageous about engaging young supporters. Youth were encouraged to develop their own messages and build local organizations in support of the candidate.                 
                

            
                Since then, neither the Obama administration nor the Democratic Party has innovated very impressively or shared much power with their grassroots allies. They have created some public online forums, but their main idea right now seems to be sending the president onto comedy shows, much as Bill Clinton played his sax on the ""Aresenio Hall Show"" in 1992.                
                

            
                Over the next year or so, young Americans may draw several alternative lessons from ObamaCare. The conclusions they reach will affect their view of politics for decades to come.                
                

            
                First, they may decide that health reform was a failure, even a fiasco, and draw the general lesson that the government is incompetent or untrustworthy. That would move them to the right. Republicans have every reason to drive this lesson home.                
                

            
                Second, youth may decide that ObamaCare worked.                 
                

            
                Despite all the fireworks, it was actually a rather modest tweak in the private health insurance market, a set of rules and incentives that will shift some people’s behavior. They may conclude that expert-driven reforms can benefit society and that Republicans have just stood in the way of progress. That would keep youth on the center-left.                
                

            
                Third, they might possibly decide that we (not just the government or a few experts) have improved our health care system. If young people become heavily involved in community health centers and efforts like Health Access California, they would see themselves directly improving the nation’s health. They would say that it wasn’t Barack Obama but the American people who broadened health coverage and began to cut costs.                 
                

            
                That conclusion would generate a new spirit of responsibility and creativity that would not belong narrowly to the right or the left.                
                

            
                But to get it started would take a lot more than bantering with Zach Galifianakis.

                Watching President Obama's response to Thursday's Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of his health care reform law, I could not help but think how different things would be if he had given the same speech two years ago.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                He began his remarks from the White House by saying the Court had “reaffirmed a fundamental principle that here in America -- in the wealthiest nation on Earth -- no illness or accident should lead to any family's financial ruin.”                
                

            
                Reaffirmed?                 
                

            
                If you ask most Americans, they will tell you the president and his party never made that point in the first place. All the talk was about “Cornhusker Kickbacks” and “Chicago-style politics,” to win votes in Congress. GOP critics hammered the plan as a “big government takeover” and “socialism.”                
                

            
                But with last week’s Supreme Court ruling in favor of the health care plan public opinion on the plan is starting to become more favorable.                
                

            
                On Sunday Reuters released a poll showing 48 percent of registered voters now back the bill. That is up five percent since the ruling. That includes a bump in support among independent voters from 27 percent to 38 percent.  And even opposition among Republicans, who overwhelmingly hate it, went down five percentage points from 86 percent to 81 percent.                
                

            
                And those numbers are likely to keep rising. Also, GOP critics are now on the defensive. They have to talk about specific benefits in the law and how they could do better if they repeal the law.
 That is going to be hard for Republicans once Americans personally start reaping the benefit of the law.                
                

            
                Here are a couple of reasons why I say this:
 
 First, the parts of the president's health care law that have already been implemented are actually very popular. And Americans tell pollsters they don't want to see them taken away.                
                

            
                Clear majorities of people say they want insurance companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions, they want children to be able to stay on their parent's health insurance until they are 26 or find a job, they don't want insurance companies dropping people's coverage when they get sick or hiking up their premiums. If you poll senior citizens and ask them if they like saving money on their prescription drugs, they say they do.                
                

            
                Second, while it is not a majority there is still a significant percentage of Americans people who say they oppose the law because they think it doesn't go far enough. They wanted a public option or single payer.                
                

            
                For example, a New York Times/CBS News poll released in early June found that 37 percent of Americans believed the law went too far, while 27 percent said not far enough and 25 percent said about right.                
                

            
                When you delve deeper into the numbers 26 percent of those in opposition thought the law was about right or wanted the government to go even further – they wanted a Medicare type program to cover all Americans regardless of age.
 
 One of the main reasons for opposition to the bill was the mandate for everyone to have health insurance or pay a tax/penalty equal to cost of an insurance premium.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney understood the necessity of the individual mandate when he was governor of Massachusetts. That is why he made it the centerpiece of RomneyCare.                
                

            
                Though he disowned it during the 2012 GOP primaries, RomneyCare has been a monumental success. The Bay State currently has the best insurance coverage rate of any state in the union – with 100 percent of all children in the state covered and 98 percent of all residents.                
                

            
                The Obama campaign would be wise to point this out as they message their health care victory between now and November.                
                

            
                The Court’s decision also means that the other good provisions of the Affordable Care Act will be allowed to stand.                
                

            
                As the president pointed out in his speech, 13 million Americans or their employers who provide health insurance will be receiving a rebate check from their insurance companies this summer. The new law requires insurers to spend 80 percent of their money on insurance and not on administrative overhead and bonuses to their CEOs.                
                

            
                Seniors citizens will also receive a discount on their prescription drugs, which the president noted has already saved more than 5 million Medicare beneficiaries about $600 each. By 2020, the law will fully close the Medicare part D coverage gap – commonly known as ""the donut hole"" – saving seniors even more money.                
                

            
                Americans enrolled in Medicare Part C – or Medicare Advantage -- have seen their premiums lowered by 16 percent since 2010, giving seniors access to inexpensive, quality health care. Their premiums will continue to be lowered once the law is fully implemented.                
                

            
                People concerned about fraud in Medicare should also applaud the Court’s decision. Due to new enforcement powers given to the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, $4.1 billion in fraudulent Medicare claims were stopped in 2011. This constitutes the largest sum ever recovered in a single year from individuals and companies attempting to defraud the American taxpayers. Look for a continued reduction in the incidence of Medicare fraud in the coming years.                
                

            
                Now that the president has demonstrated that he is willing to explain the benefits of the law to the American people, those numbers are pliable – they can be moved between now and the election.                
                

            
                Chief Justice John Roberts has not only given ObamaCare the imprimatur of constitutionality, he has given the president license to brag about his bill on the campaign trail.

What President-elect Trump should do now: Ten suggestions,"FILE -- 
	                        
	                        	 (AP Photo/Richard Drew )
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                For nearly seventeen months now, I presumed that Donald Trump was playing an elaborate game of chicken with the American people.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Sure, Trump was running for president. But there’s no way it would last until Election Day. The moment another Republican embraced the border wall, or Trump tired of the candidates’ debates, or voters tired of Trump, he’d quit the race and return to business as usual: developing real estate and fostering his cult of personality.                
                

            
                But Trump kept going – through the primaries, then the general election, to a stunning Election Night upset that earns him a four-year stay in a white, albeit less ornate mansion that’s a short stroll from the fancier hotel he recently opened in the nation’s capital.                
                

            
                Now Donald Trump will be the nation’s 45th President.                
                

            
                Repeat, exhale . . . then say it again.                
                

            
                Donald Trump will be the nation’s 45th President.                
                

            
                The trick now: solving the Bill McKay question. That’s the fictional politician Robert Redford played in the 1972 movie “The Candidate,” which ends with the senator-elect asking: “What do we now?”.                
                

            
                Here are 10 suggestions for President-Elect Trump.                
                

            
                1. Seize the Moment. I was going to start this by suggesting Trump spend a week in Palm Beach seclusion for some much-needed R&R. That can wait until Thanksgiving and beyond, when it’s time for the big transition decisions that can be done behind the scenes.                
                

            
                If I were Trump, I’d travel back to the unlikeliest states that delivered for him on Election Day and hold large rallies – both to thank the voters and explain the greater mission ahead to change Washington’s culture. I’d add in a couple of rallies in states that didn’t vote for him, just to underscore that he wants to be a president for the entire people.                
                

            
                Trump should invite Hillary Clinton for a private lunch. He should also let it be known that he wants to sit down with President Obama and discuss an amicable transition.                
                

            
                2. Read Up on Andrew Jackson. This was only the second time in the history of the nation that an election was held at the end of three consecutive two-term presidencies.                
                

            
                In 1824, it was John Quincy Adams staving off a populist challenge from Andrew Jackson, the man who statue sits in Lafayette Park, across the street from the North Portico of the White House.                
                

            
                That race was bitter and ended with talk of a rigged system (a “corrupt bargain” between Adams and House Speaker Henry Clay). Four years later, Jackson rode the revolution into Washington, the tip of the spear of voter resentment against a political class that had dominated the first 50 years of the republic.                
                

            
                This could have been the scenario in 2020. Much to everyone’s surprise, the revolution came four years ahead of schedule, with the unlikeliest of generals leading the charge.                
                

            
                I don’t know if Trump is one for history, but someone in his world should introduce the man to Jackson and the roots of American populism. After all, it’s now Trump who gets to write the next chapter.                
                

            
                3. Time to Let Go. Assuming Trump is able to be a gracious winner (and his speech Wednesday night was a good start), it’s time to pivot out of campaign mode. He’s now tasked with acting as a statesman, not a showman treating presidential political like a reality TV show.                
                

            
                It’s time to bid adieu to “Crooked Hillary” and “Lying Ted” and the “corrupt media”.                
                

            
                For Trump to have any semblance of dignified leadership, he has to let go of the petty insults and juvenile denigrations that are simply unbecoming of a president.                
                

            
                That includes the dead-of-the-night tweeting.  Yes, I’d let the incoming president hold on his Smartphone – so long as he limits it to crowd selfies.                
                

            
                4. Meet With GOP Thought Leaders. Can Trump work with a Republican Congress? Some members will be on board right away; for others, it will take time (hint: handing out presidential goodies has a way of healing wounds).                
                

            
                The more immediate concern for Trump would be getting Republican thought leaders on board – the commentary class whose support will come in handy when it’s time to rally the party behind a first-term agenda.                
                

            
                There’s nothing stopping Trump from holding a series of dinner salons with influential conservatives in New York (The Wall Street Journal editorial board, for example) and in the District of Columbia (Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, George Will, to name just a few).                
                

            
                Presidents tend to do this at the end of their presidency – courting historians in an attempt to spin their first draft of history. Trump needs the ideas merchants sooner than he may realize.                
                

            
                5. Put Someone in The West Wing Who’ll Challenge You. Throughout the saga that was the Trump campaign, there was always the question of adult supervision: an aide, a confidante who could tell Trump things he didn’t want to hear and convince him to moderate bad habits.                
                

            
                Kellyanne Conway came closest to achieving disciplinary influence over Trump. At best, she’ll divide her time between Washington and her home in northern New Jersey.                
                

            
                This is a job for the new chief of staff. Who has the stature to pull this off? New Gingrich? Rudy Giuliani? Would either be willing to be the West Wing’s bad cop, confronting Trump when they think he’s wrong on policy, strategy or execution?                
                

            
                This is a time when it pays to have wise counsel from a long-time Washington insider. We’ll see if Trump lets anyone of that ilk inside the tent.                
                

            
                6. Build a Cabinet of Insiders and Outsiders. Are we in store for talk of another “Team Of Rivals” approach to building a presidential cabinet (in reality, the gang Barack Obama assembled wasn’t all that Lincoln-esque).                
                

            
                Trump could import some rivals from the GOP primaries – Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee tuned out to be loyal surrogates. And there’s the deep bench on Republicans in Congress and in running states nationwide. What Trump does about Chris Christie – leading the transition effort, perhaps coveting the Attorney General slot, but tainted by last week’s “Bridgegate” convictions – will be interesting to watch.                
                

            
                A reminder for Trump: in addition to promising to drain the Washington, D.C. swamp, he began the campaign vowing to bring a business sensibility to the federal government. If he doesn’t sprinkle his cabinet with secretaries possessing a private sector, outsiders’ perspective, then the president-elect has broken his first pledge.                
                

            
                7. Reboot Press Relations. If you think the Chief of Staff will have it tough, try being the new White House Secretary.                
                

            
                Most new administrations get a period of grace before the press starts turning the screws. Not Trump – certainly not after months of demonizing his press entourage.                
                

            
                Trump won’t receive the same fan-boy coverage that characterized Obama’s first year on the job. At best, he plays for a draw by being more transparent than his predecessor (not a high bar to clear).                   
                

            
                Just as stressful for the press secretary will be dealing with the new president when there’s bad press – that’s not an if, but a when. We know Trump can be overly sensitive to negative coverage. If he’s smart, he resists the urge to storm into the Briefing Room and tell the press corps what’s on his mind.                
                

            
                8. Deliver a Humble Inaugural. It took Ronald Reagan 2,427 words to deliver a moving inaugural in 1981. JFK did his in 1,366 words. Abraham Lincoln, in 1865, was even terser: a mere 700 words.                
                

            
                For Trump, this first big speech is more than the opening act of his presidency. It’s about making a good first impression with a skeptical public. He foes that by demonstrating the enormity of the vow he will have just taken.                
                

            
                Trump has an advantage here: a bench of talented speechwriters from the past three Republican presidencies who may be willing to help with the historical (my Hoover Institution colleague Peter Robinson, author of Reagan’s “Tear Down This Wall” speech, would be a good place to start).                
                

            
                Trump should task a team to study how past presidents approached their first address, pair it with some solid polling and focus groups, and keep the rhetoric to a minimum and the style muted. If so, Trump just might get off to a good start.                
                

            
                9. Strike Fast with the Stroke of a Pen. For all the talk of what he can pull off with a Republican Congress, consider what Trump can do on his own, thanks to the use of executive orders.                
                

            
                Here is a list of 13 things Trump could do in his first day on the job:                  
                

            
                Cancelling the Paris climate accord, scrapping energy regulations, approving the Keystone pipeline, reversing coal leasing moratoriums on federal lands.                
                

            
                And maybe the biggest blow of all: he could kill the Iran nuclear deal.                
                

            
                10. Offer a Pragmatic Agenda. Those three consecutive two-term presidencies were marked by consistency and comity, the final stretch of the run dubbed the “Era of Good Feelings”.                
                

            
                Bill Clinton and Barack Obama almost didn’t get that second term because they bit off more than they could chew once they took office. For each, a big reach on health care reform would have devastating consequences I midterm elections.                
                

            
                Trump doesn’t lack for bold, provocative ideas – most notably, building that wall along the southern border. But can he do that, tax reform, and set a new course on defense spending and national security, not to mention repealing and replacing ObamaCare? Of course not.                
                

            
                So where should Trump start? I’d choose tax reform. There’s arguably more bipartisan consensus on that than anything else he’s proposed. And the promise of new revenue will help justify any extra dough Trump wants to spend on a Pentagon buildup or an infrastructure blueprint.                
                

            
                Can Trump succeed at all of the above? It helps that the media will usher him into office with brutally low expectations. If he gets to work, takes the job seriously and begins to make headway in a horribly divided town, that bar has nowhere to go but up.

Emanuel vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania and an oncologist  who has advised the White House on health care reform, offers some interesting suggestions about to how to resuscitate a dying Healthcare.gov.                                              ADVERTISEMENT

                This is the same question everybody should be asking of what the A-Team should really look like to make sure that Healthcare.gov doesn’t die.-- After all it’s pretty clear that up until now the only people caring for this dying website may be some interns or residents in training.

                1. Understanding the nuts and bolts of complex health data.                
                

            
                Anybody who steps in to build a team to resuscitate Healthcare.gov needs to understand the complexities of enrollment systems, payroll systems and insurance systems to know how that data should ultimately be tied together.                  
                

            
                If the chief surgeon does not understand what he is going to find when he opens up Healthcare.gov, and what he needs to do about it, it doesn’t really matter about his ability to give orders because he will have no way of giving instructions to even the best technologists about where to look, and what to do, and what potential obstacles to look for.                  
                

            
                The key people in the industry who understand the complexities of these systems are few and far between, but they have all had some kind of management role in a large insurance company, health care data company or perhaps even a state-level exchange.                
                

            
                2. Understanding the complexities of health insurance, purchasing and pricing.                
                

            
                For decades employers, brokers and insurance companies have been struggling with a process called “open-enrollment” that typically happens every fall.                  
                

            
                No matter how many times a company goes through this process it is an absolute nightmare for a Director of Benefits in any large corporation.                  
                

            
                Why would anyone believe that bringing in individuals with no expertise or understanding of what is involved in this process could help build a website for millions of individuals to purchase insurance and make decisions?                  
                

            
                Anybody that joins the resuscitation team now should have experience in what consumers are looking for, and ensure that every possible output of the website is logical.                
                

            
                3. Understanding how to build a great customer experience.                
                

            
                There is no question that Silicon Valley has figured out how to create delightful customer experiences better than anyone. But health care is different.                  
                

            
                'Without understanding health care delivery and the nuances of the system, it is impossible to deliver customer satisfaction and also be able to measure it credibly without truly understanding the needs of the individual who trying to buy insurance.                  
                

            
                The biggest mistake is to stack the deck with individuals who are trying to resuscitate Healthcare.gov who know nothing about health or care and only know about “gov.” We don’t need technicians; we need health care Super Stars to fix the problem.                
                

            
                4. Understanding how to communicate.                
                

            
                The biggest challenge for the Obama administration has been anticipation and communication. A key part of the A-Team needs to be individuals who credibly understand the problems and is able to communicate to the public about what to anticipate that people will believe.                  
                

            
                Imagine if you were in the waiting room of a hospital expecting to get news about how the surgery of your family member is going. Who would you want to hear from -- the billing manager or the surgeon?                  
                

            
                A key flaw in the entire strategy has been establishing an effective communications platform that delivers reliable, concise, coherent information to people who don’t even understand what health insurance is and are looking for help.                
                

            
                5. Understanding how to measure results.                
                

            
                A major gap in the rollout is the gaping black hole of how many people have actually enrolled and purchased an insurance plan.                  
                

            
                It’s a simple question.                  
                

            
                Yet, all of the focus has been on building a really slick website, but it appears that little attention has been given to reporting results.                   
                

            
                The only way we will ever know if the Affordable Care Act is really improving access, reducing costs and enhancing quality is if we have the expertise to know how to collect, analyze and communicate that information.                 
                

            
                A key member of the team needs to be somebody from a senior leadership role who has worked with various stakeholders in the healthcare industry, who has analyzed health care data, and who knows what it means to help create a framework for communicating results, irrespective of whether they are good or bad.                
                

            
                As the ObamaCare team scrambles to respond to the Code Blue, and if people without these key skill sets are not part of the crew, then the prognosis for Healahcare.gov, or any part of the Affordable Care Act, is bleak.

When Is Team Obama Going to Take Responsibility for the Sorry State of Our Economy?,"After serving as the White House press secretary and as a spokesperson for years before that, I learned what it feels like to dread bad headlines.

It used to be you’d wait until the paper was thrown on the stoop and you’d run down the stairs holding your breath to see what it said. Now you just click online after 10 p.m. and that determines the kind of sleep you’ll get that night.

Headlines are often sharp and cutting while the articles themselves are more nuanced, and when read in full aren’t as bad as you first thought. But as reporters love to say, “I don’t write the headlines.”

Today, Democrats (and especially the White House) are reeling from bad headlines about our economic condition. Headlines this week included doom and gloom about the stock market, the housing market, the economic growth revision downward and the dismal job market. Specific examples include The Wall Street Journal’s, “Economic Outlook Darkens;” CNBC’s “Horror for the U.S. Economy as Data Falls Off Cliff” and the Washington Post’s “As Recovery Loses Steam, Few Remedies Left.”

One bad headline is a headache, two is a concern, but three sets off the alarm bells. Once the narrative takes hold, it’s hard to reshape it.

As this storyline has really started to sink in, some very experienced political analysts have described Rep. Paul Ryan’s “Roadmap for America” as being too big and bitter a pill for the American people to swallow. Some have even suggested Ryan has done a disservice to his party by proposing it.

Far be it from me to question the judgment of these analysts, but I think it’s worth breaking down their assessments of Ryan’s proposal before claiming he’s trying to sink the ship.

While some say he didn’t lay enough groundwork to sell his proposal to Congress or the public, others have said that his proposal is going to hurt the momentum the GOP built with the 2010 midterm elections, potentially affecting House and Senate races in 2012.

Democrats also love to demagogue Ryan. Their behavior is based solely on his desire to reform a broken, out-of-control program -- aka Medicare – that they want to keep – regardless of costs, consequences or the truth. And the truth is that the entitlements they want to preserve can’t survive unless there arereforms made soon.

Sure, Ryan could have laid more groundwork, but it’s almost always the charge that more is needed with major policy efforts—President Bush faced the same challenge with his Social Security reform proposal. President Obama, too, dealt with the same problem when he passed health care reform without working for more Republican votes, which helped lead to Democrats losing anhistoric number of seats in 2010.

I believe that had Ryan been timid and not faced up to the reality of our situation—that these reforms, including Medicare, are absolutely necessary—it would have ultimately been worse for both Republicans and the conservative movement as it stands. Timidity is not what’s called for, nor would it have been rewarded.

In showing his willingness to take on a very tough issue, Ryan is also showing leadership in re-charting our nation’s economic course. As we saw with this week’s headlines, the White House has us heading in a very different direction—and it ain’t good.

That said, it’s not adequate to place all the blame on the president for the economic numbers as they are – but at this point, 2.5 years into Obama’s presidency, they own this economy fair and square. The economic policies the administration has advanced, first through a partisan Congress and then through the Executive Branch, have had consequences.

I remember in 2009 when Vice President Biden sung the praises of Obama’s recovery plan, welcoming Americans to the “Recovery Summer.” I thought at the time it wasn't good, because if the White House is willing to claim credit for the ups, it also needs to be willing to take the blame for the downs.

Which leads me to wonder: Who, really, is doing their party a disservice—the Republicans, or the Democrats?

Ryan’s budget is helping people accept reality—that cold, sinking feeling they’ve had about the economy, just like the one you get when you realize a relationship isn’t just in dangerous waters, but is about to run aground for good.

Without the White House accepting some responsibility for the state our nation’s ship is in and offering a course-correction, our economic future could hit the rocks.

"You Can Run But You Cannot Hide from the ObamaCare Disaster, Mr. President","For months the Obama administration has dropped the “cone of silence” over ObamaCare. They don’t want to talk about it for a very good reason—most Americans continue to believe the health care law will hurt the nation.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                They’re right.

As the president raises hundreds of millions of dollars for his reelection campaign the last thing in the world he wants is to do is talk about terrible public policy he can’t blame on George Bush. It’s the president’s “signature issue” and it’s shaping up to be a bigger disaster than even critics foresaw.

How does he explain, after all, that his health care reform requires small businesses with 50 employees to add costly expanded coverage or pay substantial fines if they hire one more employee? The perverse effect on our small business engine of growth at the very moment when it is most needed has been that all hiring has stopped. Explain that.

What does he say to all those Americans he repeatedly scolded that they could keep their own doctors after passage of the bill? Several recent surveys of employers predict that as many as half of all employers will drop health care coverage and pay the fines because it’s less costly. What happens to all those employees? Tens of millions will be sent into government run health exchanges--without their own doctors.Good luck finding doctors to treat them in less than a few months.                 
                

            
                The law of supply and demand pretty obviously dictates that you can’t add 30 million new patients to a finite supply of doctors without destroying any chance of being treated quickly.                 
                

            
                Who wants to talk about the waiting lists in Canada or the 800,000 people waiting for needed surgeries in Great Britain? Not candidate Obama and not the Democratic Senators who are up for reelection on a legislative record of first enacting ObamaCare and then voting twice against repeal. The fact that so many doctors say they’ll quit once the law is fully implemented, it will make an inevitably bad situation even worse.

In a nation that threw off the rule of kings and aristocrats how does he explain that a panel of government bureaucrats beyond the reach of Congress or even the courts who will soon decide what treatments will be provided? Even Democrats have become skittish about this.

For that matter, illegal immigrants will likely get free ObamaCare under a recently announced program. That means that the national debt certainly will climb even higher, despite promises to the contrary. Rationing will inevitably take place and health insurance costs will continue to rise faster than ever. Please Mr. President, can you explain the point of this reform again?

No, it would be much better for all those who rammed this bad law down the throats of an unwilling public to tip-toe right past it but the American people have not forgotten.                 
                

            
                This week my campaign delivers 1.6 million petitions to the Senate demanding the repeal of ObamaCare. Last week our supporters made more than 25,000 phone calls to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Democrats who have refused to admit the obvious truth: this law is a disaster.

The White House almost escaped scrutiny from the mainstream media last week when they conceded that the Supreme Court should take up the Constitutional questions surrounding ObamaCare as soon as possible. But how can they justify making every American buy insurance when such a sweeping power is not specifically “enumerated” in the Constitution?                 
                

            
                We’re sure the White House already relied upon the advice of then Solicitor General Elena Kagan, to spin a legal theory. They’ll doubtlessly be counting on Justice Kagan for a sympathetic ear at the Supreme Court.

Our petitioners believe that laws passed without the “consent of the governed” should be repealed by the same legislators but there are three paths to repeal: the Supreme Court, the legislature and the polling booth.                 
                

            
                We are determined to see this destructive law repealed in Congress before more damage is done, more promises are broken and before it ever arrives at the Supreme Court. Our economic recovery depends on it and, as politicians inWashington are beginning to realize, so do a lot of incumbent election hopes. Let’s talk about that, Mr. President.                
                

            
                Ken Hoagland is chairman of Repeal It Now.org and Restore America’s Voice Foundation. Television ads have resulted more than 1.6 million petitions demanding repeal of ObamaCare.

This week 1.6 million petitions are scheduled for delivery to the Senate.

Lessons for Romney's Rivals As 2012 Presidential Campaign Heats Up,"At the GOP debate last week in New Hampshire Mitt Romney issued a school-yard, bad-ass, you-want-some of-this challenge to President Obama.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                “I can’t wait to debate President Obama on health care” he declared.                
                

            
                Then with a distinct cockiness, Gov. Romney added that he wants to ask the president: “Why didn’t you give me a call and ask what worked and what didn’t?”                
                

            
                That is pretty extraordinary given that President Obama’s Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) operates on the very same principles as the plan that Romney put in place during his time as governor of Massachusetts. Not a single Republican voted to support the president’s national version of Romney’s Massachusetts plan. And Republican opposition to the Romney-like plan set a political fire to the Tea Party movement and led to the GOP gaining the majority of the House in the 2010 mid-terms.                
                

            
                All of that is enough to create surprise at hearing Romney boast to Republicans that he wants to engage the issue. But it is even more stunning for people who know Romney’s checkered history with political debates.                
                

            
                As the sportscaster Warner Wolf says – “Let’s Go to Videotape!”                
                

            
                The climax of Romney’s 1994 Senate campaign against the late Massachusetts Sen. Teddy Kennedy was a televised debate between the two candidates in Boston’s historic Faneuil Hall.                 
                

            
                Heading into the debate, polls had Romney and Kennedy in a tight race and some political analysts said out loud Kennedy was in real danger of losing the Senate seat that he had held for three decades.                
                

            
                In the debate, Romney attacked Kennedy with charges that some of his family’s real estate holdings had benefited from government subsidies. Kennedy somberly replied: “Mr. Romney, my family did not enter public service for the money. And frankly, we’ve paid too high a price for it.”                
                

            
                Kennedy was of course referring to his two older brothers – President John F. Kennedy and Senator Bobby Kennedy – who were both assassinated.                
                

            
                Romney was caught flat-footed and he ultimately lost the election by 17 points.                
                

            
                And that was not the only moment when the debate went badly for Romney. As abortion was discussed, Romney professed to be pro-choice and at the same time pro-life in his personal beliefs. Sen. Kennedy walloped Romney by saying: “I am pro-choice. My opponent is multiple choice.”                
                

            
                Later, as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, Romney tried to maintain a precarious balance between his personal pro-life beliefs and pro-choice policies in his administration.                
                

            
                That is, until he was running for the 2008 Republican nomination, when he stressed his pro-life credentials to anyone who would listen.                
                

            
                Political consultant Dick Morris termed his position a “flip-flop-flip” adding that in politics, “you only get to change your mind once on abortion.”                
                

            
                Also in that 1994 debate that Romney vowed he would do more to promote gay rights than Senator Kennedy. But later as governor, Romney was one of the earliest and most ardent opponents of same sex marriage.                
                

            
                Though Romney has undoubtedly grown and matured as a candidate since that debate performance, the lesson for his GOP rivals – and President Obama (if Romney wins the GOP nomination) -- is that debating does not appear to be one of the former governor’s strong points.

And that's why it was surprising that in last week’s Republican debate Romney’s challengers for the nomination treated him if they were in a boxing ring with the young Muhammad Ali.                
                

            
                Moderator John King gave former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty a perfect opening to attack Romney on his Achilles heel – health care. Pawlenty did not take it. Instead, he reverted to Obama-bashing rather than criticizing Romney.

Pawlenty had previously described President Obama’s health care reform package as “Obamney-care” – referring to the similarities between Obama’s health law and the one enacted by governor.                
                

            
                Pawlenty later said he regretted not taking the opportunity to engage Romney.                
                

            
                President Obama is not likely to be so deferential. If the president ever does get the chance to debate Romney and Romney asks why he did not call him before passing the health care plan, Obama need only reply: “Because I wasn’t sure which Mitt Romney would answer the phone.”                
                

            
                And then President Obama may well be on his way to another Kennedy-style landslide victory.

CBO score: An opportunity for Republicans to get serious about making state-led health care reform work,"Republicans have tasked themselves with fixing ObamaCare—repealing and replacing it with something better, that lowers premiums and offers greater choice, without pulling the rug out from under the millions of Americans who have gained coverage under the law.  
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                Reading Wednesday’s Congressional Budget Office score of the American Health Care Act, you’d think this was Mission Impossible, and that states would “race to the bottom” in pursuing waivers that would give them more flexibility in how insurance is priced and regulated. CBO projects, for instance, that costs for older or sicker patients could rise sharply for patients living in states that pursued the most aggressive waivers.
                
                


                
            
                The CBO’s job is to score legislation as written—and they’ve certainly pointed out some shortcomings in how the AHCA is currently structured. But CBO has also highlighted key improvements Republicans in the Senate could make to stabilize markets: increasing reinsurance funding for high-cost patients, offering means-tested cost sharing subsidies for the low-income uninsured, and strengthening incentives for young, healthy populations to get and hold coverage. 
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            The Dept. of Health and Human Services could be tasked with studying, in real time, the effects of state waivers on important measures like access to care, health outcomes, and out of pocket costs.
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
            
                Taken together, these three fixes would enable states to experiment with more affordable plan designs while still providing robust coverage to patients with expensive pre-existing conditions.     
                
                


                
            
                The Republicans are on the right track in one critical respect, noted in the latest CBO score.  Although the coverage score still gives many pause (23 million more uninsured compared to the ACA by 2026), CBO projects that both the AHCA's Patient and State Stability Fund and the Federal Invisible Risk Sharing Program would help to put downward pressure on premiums. 
                
                


                
            
                Well-designed and well-funded risk pools or reinsurance would certainly go a long way in stabilizing state insurance markets. By offsetting claims associated with high cost patients, these programs can lower premiums across the board, keeping them affordable for the vast majority of healthy enrollees. The AHCA’s programs simply need more funding (some estimates have suggested $15-20 billion annually.)
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                The next step is to offer cost sharing subsidies for lower income enrollees, in addition to the AHCA’s flat tax credit. Adding means-tested cost-sharing subsidies will help keep coverage within reach for the populations who need it most. As long as cost sharing subsidies are available for these populations, higher deductible or catastrophic plans could offer lower premiums for healthier enrollees who just need protection against major medical events.
                
                


                
            
                Finally, the Senate needs to address the AHCA’s penalty for going without coverage. CBO expects that, as currently structured, the law would encourage younger, healthier enrollees to stay uninsured because the penalty for going without coverage is too weak. In this respect, it suffers from the same problem as ObamaCare, which hasn’t attracted enough young, healthy enrollees. 
                
                


                
            
                The truth is, no one really knows a single, blanket solution for this problem. The best approach is to allow the states to come up with their own coverage strategies. Some might choose auto-enrollment in a zero-deductible catastrophic plan, larger or longer penalties for buying coverage after you become sick, or other approaches. Over time, we could learn what works best. 
                
                


                
            
                The Senate can also reassure skeptics of state flexibility by explicitly including guardrails that help protect patients, and ensure that states focus on meeting clear goals for vulnerable populations. 
                
                


                
            
                The Department of Health and Human Services, for instance, could be tasked with studying, in real time, the effects of state waivers on important measures like access to care, health outcomes, and out of pocket costs. HHS could also help states model and evaluate waiver proposals, collect data, and ensure greater transparency around health plan costs and quality.
                
                


                
            
                Congress should also tie reinsurance funding to states reforming their health care markets to promote competition and transparency—helping patients and consumers to find providers who deliver better care at lower cost.
                
                


                
            
                ObamaCare’s one-size-fits-all plan design has driven up costs, and locked healthier patients out of the market. States should be encouraged to make greater use of health savings accounts, allow insurers to design different cost sharing or provider networks within established categories of essential health benefits that provide comparable access to care at lower cost, and offer more value-based insurance designs that waive co-pays or deductibles for high value services. 
                
                


                
            
                House Speaker Paul Ryan, speaking at an Axios event recently, said, “Let's just pay for the people who are catastrophically ill. Let's just do that. Because I don't think anybody, Republican, Democrat, whatever, thinks that if a person gets breast cancer in her 40s, she should go bankrupt for getting it."" 
                
                


                
            
                He’s right. Doing so will not only allow Republicans to answer serious critics of the AHCA, but empower states to find ways to supercharge health care competition that improves health outcomes at less cost to patients and taxpayers.   
                
                


                
            
                The CBO score isn’t cause for abandoning waivers. It’s a call to get serious about making them work.

Can Tim Pawlenty Beat Out Mitt Romney and Become the GOP's 2012 Nominee?,"The smart money among Washington political insiders is being stacked high in front of two nominees for the GOP presidential nomination: Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty. And at the moment the bets on Pawlenty are coming fast.
On his Comedy Central show, Jon Stewart recently described Mitt Romney as the “guy who fired everybody’s dad.” When the GOP contest comes down to a choice between these two former Republican blue state governors, Pawlenty will claim to represent the guy on the other side of that exchange – the working class voter who was fired by the Romney-type corporate raider.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It may work.                
                

            
                Pawlenty fits the bill as the fresh face in the race for establishment Republicans looking for as a nominee. He is a capable, steady and experienced politician who allows the general election to become all about President Obama and whatever anger, discontent, disappointment voters may feel about the incumbent.                
                

            
                But first Pawlenty has to win over social conservatives, Tea Party activists, and increase his name recognition among grassroots Republicans to have any chance of taking the nomination from Romney.                
                

            
                “T-Paw,” as his supporters call him, has a compelling personal story that he is sharing with voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. His appeal to white, working class, middle-income Republicans is based on a simple pitch: I am one of you.                
                

            
                After his mother passed away when he was a teenager, his father worked very hard as a meat packer and then a truck driver to support Pawlenty and his four brothers and sisters. He was the first in his family to earn a college degree. Of all the GOP candidates, Pawlenty has lived a life that is closest to the experience of the average American family -- to the extent there is such a thing.                
                

            
                As Ron Brownstein recently noted in the National Journal, the white working class voting bloc is currently pessimistic and frightened about the future. There is every indication that their anxiety will influence their voting behavior. Overall, 55 percent of whites voted for Republican Sen. John McCain in the 2008 election. But President Obama won the majority of voters earning less than $50,000 a year.                
                

            
                Recent polls show white working class voters fear they are getting left behind – especially the white men who worked in construction or manufacturing -- in the nation’s post-recession economic transformation and no one in government or big business gives a damn.                
                

            
                As early as 2008 when he was on John McCain’s short list for Vice President, Pawlenty was arguing that Republicans needed to be “the party of Sam’s Club not just the country club”
While Romney’s consistency problems are well known – flip flopping on abortion, gay marriage, auto bailouts, employer mandates in health care and an a whole host of other issues – Pawlenty may be vulnerable to a similar line of attack from Democrats.
The affable 50-year-old Minnesotan supported a version of cap-and-trade – just like President Obama - to control pollution before changing his position to fit with Republican opposition. But his problems also extend to the credibility of his claim to be a champion of the working class.

Pawlenty proudly declares that he grew up in a union household. Yet, Pawlenty enthusiastically supported the efforts of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker to strip public sector union workers of their collective bargaining rights earlier this year. Moreover, as Governor of Minnesota, Pawlenty supported legislation that would have limited these same basic rights for the North Star State’s public union workers.                
                

            
                Like the rest of his party, Pawlenty railed against President Obama’s stimulus package that was comprised mostly of tax cuts for middle class families – the very people he purports to be the champion of. He vehemently opposed Obama’s health care reform legislation that allows those same families to keep their children on their family’s insurance plan until they are 26 years old or can find a job.                
                

            
                Pawlenty also decried Obama’s rescue of the American auto industry as a “bailout” even though it saved the industry and created thousands of blue-collar jobs.                
                

            
                By all accounts, Pawlenty’s image as a likeable and decent public servant is well deserved. However, once working class voters start to give him serious consideration they may conclude his claim to represent them is just another reason to feel that no one is really looking out for them. Pawlenty’s goal is to give them every reason to reach a different conclusion.

                As President Obama sets off on his “Betting On America” bus tour through the key swing states of Pennsylvania and Ohio, both the Obama and Romney campaigns are anxiously awaiting the numbers from Friday's monthly jobs report. As they wait, it's clear that the Supreme Court's ruling last week to uphold ObamaCare will not be enough to reelect the president in 2012.   
   
 To be sure, President Obama now finds himself in a slightly stronger position vis-à-vis Mitt Romney than he was just a few weeks ago – with the latest Real Clear Politics average showing the him enjoying a narrow 2.6 point (47.0 percent to 44.4 percent) lead over Mitt Romney.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                And any lingering doubts that the ruling presented a clear short-term win for the President and the Democratic leadership were resolved during  Monday’s television appearance by Romney senior campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom, who argued on MSNBC that the mandate is a penalty, not a tax – breaking with congressional Republicans in the process.                   
                

            
                But notwithstanding the confusion and division that developed within the GOP in the wake of the Supreme Court's surprise verdict to uphold Obama's health care reform  law, there is no sense that either candidate’s overall political standing has changed.                
                

            
                Recent polling shows clearly and unambiguously that the former Massachusetts Governor remains within striking distance of the president – whose vulnerability in the polls became clearer and clearer over the course of the week.

                Here's why:  President Obama’s job approval rating is well below the crucial fifty percent mark in the latest polling by Gallup(45%-47% disapproval), and Rasmussen  (46%- 53% disapproval), and the latest Real Clear Politics average has the president with a net negative approval rating (47.6% - 48.3%).                
                

            
                These findings are consistent with the results in a new Newsweek/Daily Beast poll, conducted by my polling firm, Douglas E. Schoen, LLC. immediately following the Supreme Court ruling – in which a solid majority (54%) of voters said they disapproved of President Obama’s overall job performance, a plurality of voters said it is time to replace him with someone else (48%), and only 42% said he has done his job well enough to deserve reelection.
 
 Moreover, voters told us that Governor Romney would do a better job on handling virtually every single domestic policy measure than President Obama – including the economy (52%-37%), illegal immigration (41%-38%), health care (48%-40%), balancing the budget (48%-44%), fighting crime (35%-33%), and holding the line on taxes (45%-42%).                
                

            
                The fact that the president got no real bounce at all from the Supreme Court's ruling and saw no fundamental change in his approval ratings – even while a solid majority (58%) of voters see  the Supreme Court decision as a major political win for Obama and while only 19% see it as a win for Romney, and 23% are unsure --  indicates the profound disquiet American voters feel with current economic circumstances.                
                

            
                These findings underscore the real and fundamental political problem that President Obama and indeed both parties face -- the economy.                
                

            
                Put simply,  when voters head to the polls come November, their decision will hinge on jobs, housing and other economic indicators – not health care.                  
                

            
                Having suffered in the polls following the poor job figures for March, April, and May, the only way the president can turn these numbers around is to demonstrate real leadership on fiscal issues.                        
                

            
                Friday, the Labor Department will release the job report for June.  Stay tuned."
"Rep. Michael Burgess, MD: Why I am optimistic about health care reform in the new Congress","(Reuters)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Twenty-two years ago, the “Contract with America” promised voters that, if elected to Congress, Republicans would advance legislation to shrink the size of government, balance the budget, and reform major entitlement programs.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Americans voiced decisive support for these conservative principles at the polls in the 1994 election—Republicans won control of the House and the Senate, and Republican governors held 31 states.                
                

            
                Congress was acutely aware of the people’s desire to return to a limited federal government, and sought to start by empowering the states. As reported in the New York Times, incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich astutely observed at the start of the 104th Session, “[t]he governors are prepared to say to us if we will radically decentralize, give them the job, they will do the job.”                 
                

            
                Within one year, the Republican Congress delivered on its promise to reform the broken welfare system. As with all major legislation that has stood the test of time, welfare reform took shape on a bipartisan basis and the governors played a lead role in identifying the problems and constructing the solutions.                
                

            
                Unfortunately, the tactics employed by the Obama administration leading up to passage of the ACA stand in stark contrast to the reforms accomplished under the Contract with America.                 
                

            
                From a position inside Congress, I had a front row seat as a brand new Democratic president and a Democratically-controlled Congress went about overhauling health care behind closed doors, along party lines, and without state input. Even as Republicans were completely shut out of the process I recall thinking, where are the governors? Why are state legislatures not involved in the discussion?                
                

            
                In the years that followed, our health care system has been plagued with problems. Patients have fewer choices and burdensome mandates, consumer costs continue to spike, and 30 million Americans remain uninsured. In 2016, House Speaker Paul Ryan convened Republican members to develop an alternative way to fix our broken health care system—A Better Way.                 
                

            
                Just as they did in the 1994 election, Americans made their dissatisfaction with the status quo clear at the voting booth, and Republicans will control the White House, House, and Senate in 2017.                
                

            
                As the 115th Congress prepares to make good on its promise to deliver a Better Way to the American people, there is understandable anxiety driven by uncertainty—will the ACA be replaced? Will Medicaid be reformed? Will Medicare remain the same? These are all important questions, but I urge the American people to take heart.                 
                

            
                I am confident that the new Congress will advance legislation through an open and inclusive process to empower states, patients, taxpayers, doctors, nurses, hospitals, and insurers to participate in discussions that so profoundly affect their lives.                 
                

            
                Republicans are already taking steps to do just this. Over the past year, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee have been acquiring a deeper understanding of the challenges in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Task Force.                 
                

            
                On December 2, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and several Committee Chairmen sent a letter to state governors and insurance commissioners requesting ideas for how to reform our health care system for the benefit of the American people. On December 13, Senate Finance Committee Republicans sent a letter to governors seeking input on potential changes to health care, and announcing a roundtable on the Medicaid program in early January.                
                

            
                In many ways I see the new Congress as the rescue squad—the first responders for citizens damaged and endangered by the excesses of this experiment in nationalizing health care. But the good news is we don’t have to do it alone.                 
                

            
                By taking a page out of former Speaker Gingrich’s playbook from over 20 years ago, we can leverage the power of the state and local governments, “those laboratories of democracy,” as a force multiplier and ally to correct the errors of the past eight years.

"The Incredible, Shrinking GOP Presidential Race","The 2012 GOP field just got smaller. The disappointment among Republican voters looking for a candidate to stir them and the reluctance of so many real political stars to get in the race remains the most telling aspect of the strangest year yet in national Republican politics.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In the history of modern Republican presidential politics this year will go down as the year best described by that silly 1960's song “Please, General Custer, I don’t want to go.” And this they don't want to go to Iowa.
None of the big names wants to get into the race. None of the big money has picked a candidate and given them momentum. And the split between social conservatives and fiscal conservatives has the lackluster entries currently in the race fearful that they won’t be able to unite the party.                
                

            
                Iowa’s Republican Governor, Terry Branstad, gave testimony to the painfully slow start to the big GOP race this week when he publicly pleaded for possible candidates to please come visit his state where the caucuses will mark the start of actual vote counting in less than nine months.                
                

            
                “This is a state where you can effectively launch a campaign and it is not too late,” the governor said. He later added: “I want to welcome all current and potential 2012 presidential candidates to campaign here."" The lack of presidential candidates in the state has the governor and other Republicans worried that Iowa’s traditional moment as the focus of national politics is in jeopardy. New Hampshire, the site of the first state primary, is hoping to capitalize on Iowa’s lackluster caucus but at the moment they look to be in line for more of Iowa’s disappointment with reluctant candidates standing around while relatively unknown candidates stir apathy.                
                

            
                According to an Associated Press-Gfk poll from last week, 45% of Republican primary voters are dissatisfied with the current crop of candidates. That number is up from 33% just two months ago. Since then, the biggest news has been that two relatively big names have dropped out. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and the one and only Donald Trump announced that they will not run, preferring to remain with their television shows -- Huckabee on Fox News and Trump with NBC’s ""The Apprentice.""                
                

            
                Huckabee’s departure creates the biggest opening in the field. He won the Iowa caucuses in 2008 with an impressive 34% of the vote and was a favorite of the evangelical conservative caucus-goers. The Baptist minister’s supporters in Iowa are shopping for a socially conservative candidate to carry their banner. Rightwing firebrands like Herman Cain and Rick Santorum are in the race but have not shown evidence of benefiting from Gov. Huckabee’s decision to bow out.                
                

            
                That creates a big opportunity for Rep. Michele Bachmann. The congresswoman, who heads the Tea Party caucus in the House, this week organized 128 thousand phone calls to Iowa Republicans and she continues to surprise with her ability as a fundraiser. She claims to have made 20,000 new friends on Facebook since Gov. Huckabee took a bye.                
                

            
                However, in what can be interpreted as a warning to Rep. Bachmann and other social conservatives, Gov. Branstad has advised culture-wars-conservatives to focus on “cleaning up the economy,” rather than pandering to the social conservative voting bloc.                
                

            
                The current national frontrunner for the nomination, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, has a history of trouble with Iowa Republicans. In 2008, Mitt Romney finished second with only 25%, despite spending a lot of time and millions of dollars of his own personal fortune. Romney could not close the deal with Iowa’s Republicans then and he did not yet have the millstone of the Romney health care plan around his neck – the model for the health care plan that the far right detests, President Obama’s health care reform program.                
                

            
                In a scathing editorial, the Wall Street Journal recently pilloried Romney: “More immediately for his Republican candidacy, the debate over ObamaCare and the larger entitlement state may be the central question of the 2012 election. On that question, Mr. Romney is compromised and not credible.”                
                

            
                Another well-known Republican who is less and less comfortable in Iowa is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He managed to put himself at odds with the conservative base of the party when he blasted Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals for Medicare as “rightwing social engineering.”                
                

            
                Conservative commentators in Iowa but also on national talk radio shows, on The Journal’s editorial page and all over conservative sites on the Internet have since been scathing in charging that Gingrich’s comment weakened his candidacy as well as the entire Party’s effort to build a case against President Obama.                
                

            
                Still waiting in the wings are former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, current Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels and former U.S. envoy to China Jon Huntsman. Any or all of them could radically change the race with their entrance.                
                

            
                Most conservatives would still like to see New Jersey Governor Chris Christie throw his hat in the ring. Gov. Branstad has praised him as a “rock star” and earlier this month prominent Iowa GOP donors flew to Trenton to persuade Christie to run. Any of the other candidates will be a disappointing second choice.                
                

            
                Meanwhile, the Party establishment is increasingly embracing the possibility of a run by Gov. Daniels. But his earlier statement of distaste for highlighting social conservatism is not likely to play well in Iowa. His recent attacks on Planned Parenthood seem an expedient – some may say cheap -- political attempt to paper over that problem. But the Indiana governor knows his earlier statements and his personal story will make Iowa a tough run for him.                
                

            
                No one wants to say it out loud but at the moment the polls indicate that whoever wins the GOP nomination will probably go on to lose to President Obama in the general election. The best minds in the party say an election that is a referendum on the president is the best chance for a Republican upset. Those top GOP thinkers are looking for a steady, reasonable candidate to stand there while the focus turns to the less than overwhelming approval of President Obama.                
                

            
                The problem with that strategy is finding a steady, reliable candidate who is trusted by the Republican establishment but also fiery enough to win the support of social conservatives and Tea Party activists. That person has yet to make an appearance in Iowa or other place.                
                

            
                The disappointment among Republican voters looking for a candidate to stir them and the reluctance of so many real stars – notably Gov. Christie, Rep. Ryan, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush – remains the most telling aspect of the strangest year yet in national Republican politics.                
                

            
                Somewhere, Obama advisers David Plouffe and David Axelrod are smiling and singing a smug, mocking version of that song “Please Mr. Custer, I Don’t Want to Go.”

"Health care bill passes in House, Trump and GOP finally come together","GOP members of the House finally climbed aboard the Trump Train. 
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                It’s about time. 
                
                


                
            
                Putting aside their posturing and pontificating, Republicans at long last produced a win for the Trump White House and for Americans, passing a bill to replace ObamaCare. This was a central promise of the past several years; they needed to get it done.
                
                


                
            
                It wasn’t easy, but as Joe Biden might say, “This is a big f—ing deal!”
                
                


                
            
                The earlier failure to pass the American Health Care Act (AHCA) was a serious setback for the Trump White House, portraying the president and his aides as ill prepared to manage the affairs of the nation. 
                
                


                
            
                Voters were incredulous that after seven years of railing about the deficiencies of ObamaCare, Republicans didn’t have a shared vision for what should replace it. 
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                The inability to muster votes on the first bill exposed long-simmering disputes within the Republican party – disputes barely muted by Trump’s astonishing victory in November.
                
                


                
            
                Thursday’s successful vote is a major victory for President Trump. House members have credited the president for sticking with the fight, and the punditry is astonished that the AHCA, declared dead just a few weeks ago, actually passed. 
                
                


                
            
                Trump wheedled and cajoled, invited objectors from across the political spectrum in for an Oval Office chat, encouraged compromises and won over recalcitrant members of his own party. This is what we expect from Trump; this is the Art of the Deal.
                
                


                
            
                It is also a needed much-needed victory for the House leadership. Trump supporters are impatient with the lack of legislative progress since the election, perhaps unrealistic in their expectations. The spending bill passed this week by Congress, which failed to reflect numerous conservative priorities, enraged many on the right. Repealing ObamaCare will mollify some of those critics.
                
                


                
            
                Not only is the vote a win for health care reform; it is also a win for tax reform. The repeal of the taxes that supported the Affordable Care Act will save Americans one trillion dollars over the coming decade. That savings makes further tax cuts much easier to pass, since the reduced rates will be applied to a lower tax base. As the GOP struggles to produce a tax bill resulting in revenue neutrality, that trillion will loom large.
                
                


                
            
                Thursday’s narrow victory is of course not the end of the story. The Senate will now get a whack at the bill that will replace ObamaCare; that expected row will usher in more hand-wringing from the left. 
                
                


                
            
                Democrats cleverly put the GOP on the defensive early on in this fight, portraying President Obama’s legacy plan as the Holy Grail of health care solutions. Even as it continues to fail across the country.
                
                


                
            
                Much has been written of the shortcomings of ObamaCare, focusing in particular on the soaring premiums and rising deductibles that will only worsen this year. The truth is that a sizeable share of the population can afford health care insurance under the current plan, but not health care.
                
                


                
            
                The central failure of ObamaCare is that it does not allow insurers to charge more for customers that will require higher expenditures. Women, for instance, who require higher medical expenditures, pay the same as men under ObamaCare. Also, people with so-called “pre-existing conditions” pay the same as all others. Simply put, this is not insurance, it is welfare.
                
                


                
            
                Providing affordable insurance to all Americans – even those who are sick -- is now expected. The question is how to do that while keeping private insurers in the game. That is the intent of the modifications made to Paul Ryan’s bill, including an extra $8 billion provided to cover high-risk pools for those people with pre-existing conditions.
                
                


                
            
                The vote comes before the Congressional Budget Office has had a chance to score it. Democrats will jump on the eventual CBO report, which will most likely project that some people will lose coverage. The GOP bill will be portrayed by Democrats as heartless and mean-spirited. 
                
                


                
            
                What will not be reported by the New York Times or CNN is how many Americans have stopped going to the doctor because their ObamaCare deductible is just too high. 
                
                


                
            
                Or how many parts of the country no longer have an insurance exchange available.
                
                


                
            
                 Just in the last few weeks several companies have pulled out of Iowa, citing losses, threatening to leave that state with no individual plans. Virginia, too, is bleeding plans, as are many other states. 
                
                


                
            
                ObamaCare is simply not working; it is indefensible.
                
                


                
            
                This fight is not over. Democrats do not want to see President Obama’s principle achievement ditched. The GOP has to manage the conversation, and explain how the new bill will help middle-class Americans. They should be ready to go with ads that feature working Americans unable to pay their doctor bills, even as they are covered by ObamaCare, or Obamasnare, as it might be portrayed for millions trapped in their costly plans.
                
                


                
            
                Nancy Pelosi has accused Republicans of wanting to destroy health care and take protections away from millions., all the while providing massive tax breaks for plutocrats. 
                
                


                
            
                Republicans must drown out such extreme voices, remind Americans that ObamaCare is failing, and move forward with the Trump agenda. 
                
                


                
            
                That’s what they were elected to do.

Will Paul Ryan's Medicare Plan Bring Back Pelosi?,"Well that was quick.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                A month ago all politics in Washington was about the budget deficit and Republicans held the high ground in calling for more budget cuts.                
                

            
                Today all politics in Washington is now focused on Medicare and Democrats hold the high ground in protecting a program seniors don’t want to lose.                
                

            
                Here are 5 ways the political winds have shifted in a flash:                
                

            
                1. This week the Senate rejected a House plan calling for major changes in Medicare. Democrat Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said the Republican reform of the government program amounted to ending Medicare “as we know it.”                
                

            
                Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid chimed in, too, saying that the GOP’s Medicare plan amounts to one that “makes the rich richer and the sick sicker.”                
                

            
                2. And then there was the upset in the special election for New York’s 26th Congressional District. After the Democratic candidate triumphed in the traditional GOP stronghold the Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Committee weighed in. Democrats and Republicans, he said, had learned three lessons from the special election, “Medicare, Medicare, Medicare.”                
                

            
                But he didn’t stop there. He boldly predicted that Democrats now had a chance to regain the approximately 25 seats they’ll need to take control of the House next year. ""I fundamentally believe the House of Representatives is in play,"" he said.                
                

            
                3. The country’s highest ranking Republican, House Speaker John Boehner, admitted publicly that the loss in a heavily GOP district in upstate New York was partly “had to do with Medicare.”                
                

            
                4. Oklahoma Republican Sen. Tom Coburn walked out of budget negotiations because he wanted bigger cuts in Medicare spending. That means budget talks are stalled over Medicare. The issue now is that cuts to Medicare will define budget talks. That puts Democrats in the favorable , charmed role of starring as of champions for Medicare.                
                

            
                5. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich’s presidential campaign has imploded among fellow Republicans over his criticism of the Ryan plan as “radical” and social engineering.                
                

            
                Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty says the Ryan plan is okay but he will offer a different plan to the voters.
The Republican faithful on Capitol Hill are telling me that they simply have a “message problem” with Medicare. They say they want to do a better job reminding voters about long-standing concerns over big government deficit spending.
They want to point out that Democrats have no plan for dealing with financial problems that will one day bankrupt Medicare.                
                

            
                Republicans are fooling only themselves if they believe they can get away from the fact that 235 House Republicans voted to pass the Ryan plan in April. They are forgetting their success in using the Democrats’ vote for health care reform to rout them last fall. The voters that handed them that impressive victory are now the same voters who have now turned against them.                
                

            
                The hard fact is every poll shows the Ryan plan – which turns Medicare into a voucher program and forces senior citizens to negotiate with private insurance companies – is unpopular with people over 65 and their children.
In the 26th Congressional district of New York senior made up 15% of all voters. News reports and polls reveal that those voters, who have fears about cuts to Medicare, made the difference.                
                

            
                Jane Corwin, the Republican who lost the race, tried to reduce Republican support for the Ryan plan to a messaging problem. In the middle of her campaign, after she went on the record in support of the plan, she said this:                
                

            
                ""There have been a lot of lies and distortions about what my position on Medicare is, and it scares seniors quite frankly and I'm shocked and appalled by that,” a frustrated Corwin said. “And I think it's important seniors understand that I'm trying to save the program. I want to protect it for them and for future generations.""                
                

            
                It didn’t work. And it won’t work for Republicans nationwide. -- Even if they accuse Democrats of using ""Medi-Scare"" tactics.                
                

            
                The GOP had better come up with a effective explanation or defense of the Ryan plan before 2012 or the gains they made in 2010 will be erased. Otherwise, it might not be ridiculous to speculate about whether Nancy Pelosi will end up back in the Speaker’s chair.

A physician's take on Trump's health care plan,"Donald Trump finally released his position paper on health care reform this week, clarifying and strengthening what had been a liability, one that his major opponents, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, had mocked for its inconsistencies and assertions.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As a practicing physician who has studied and been victimized by the damaging effects of ObamaCare, I was glad to see Trump define his position. I am on the lookout for any plan that aims to undo the worst of ObamaCare: spiraling premiums, limited access to providers, high deductibles that hamstring poor and middle-class patients and heavy federal subsidies and related tax hikes.                
                

            
                Complex candidate position papers are standard fare, but the fact is that little or none of their detail will be utilized when the election is over. So I’m more interested in broad brush strokes at this point, and the American public should be too. With this in mind, let’s examine the essential bones of Trump’s health care plan, even if it lacks the flesh of the other candidates’. He released seven key points:                
                

            
                1. Repeal and replace. Trump has said this repeatedly, and it carries more weight now than previous threats thrown at President Obama’s veto pen. The Health Care Choices Act, authored by Cruz and co-sponsored by Rubio last year, included central aspects of both senators’ positions: the ability to buy health insurance across state lines and eliminating the mandate to buy insurance, the insurance marketplaces and federal subsidies. But it had zero chance of becoming law. “Repeal and replace” can become a reality only if a Republican wins the presidency.                
                

            
                2: Modify the law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. “The lines, the lines,” Trump says on the stump, referring to removing the ban, not to the growing waiting lines in doctors’ offices. Like Rubio and Cruz, Trump favors portability of health insurance from state to state. As a mega businessman, he knows this will introduce more competition into the system and drive premiums down. If, for example, Nevada offers a cheaper yet equally effective insurance product as New York, my patients could buy it there and use it here.                
                

            
                3: Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premiums on their tax returns. Businesses take these deductions, so why shouldn’t individuals? This will help people who previously couldn’t afford insurance to buy it. Rubio, too, has backed the idea of tax incentives to buy health insurance.                
                

            
                4: Health Savings Accounts. Trump proposes to expand this program. Contributions should be tax-free and be allowed to accumulate and become part of the patient’s estate. Health savings accounts work well in the doctor’s office, as a patients are more aware of what services they’re getting and what they’re actually paying for them.                
                

            
                5. All prices should be transparent. Patients should be able to shop for the best prices for procedures, examinations, etc. This will help drive prices down to a more affordable range. Right now, something like an echocardiogram is far more expensive at one hospital than another. xxxx                
                

            
                6. Block-grant Medicaid to the states. States know their people the best, Trump says, “and can manage the administration of Medicaid without federal overhead.” Rubio, too, recommends block grants. But Trump refused to denounce Medicaid expansion in New Hampshire when he was campaigning there. He has said repeatedly, “I will not let people die on the streets.” His plan doesn’t take into account that Medicaid is an expensive and inefficient state-administered insurance plan that has a narrow network of doctors and badly needs an overhaul. Simply expanding it, the way ObamaCare does, or handing over full responsibility to the states is not the best solution. Perhaps a more informed Trump will come to see this.                 
                

            
                7. Remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. Trump believes special interests are driving up prices, and he wants consumers to be able to import drugs, which will drive prices down. He has also said that Medicare should be able to negotiate prices, a controversial change. Since Medicare frequently sets the standard for prices in the industry, this makes sense – especially when it comes to the overinflated prices of new cancer and heart drugs. Rubio proposes reforming Medicare by transitioning to a privately funded premium support program intended to control costs while maintaining services, though prior efforts to privatize Medicare have failed. Cruz would raise the Medicare eligibility age, which I believe is a good idea.                
                

            
                In a Feb. 18 interview with CNN, Trump indicated he would keep ObamaCare’s individual mandate, which makes you pay a fine if you don’t have health insurance. But the next day he tweeted that he would remove the mandate (a central piece of ObamaCare) and install a “backstop for pre-existing conditions.” His positions on health care seem to be evolving as he learns more.  In this week’s position paper, it is clear that he intends to get rid of the individual mandate. During last week’s debate, he flatly denied Cruz’s accusation that he wants the government to pay for everyone’s health care. Perhaps Trump would have agreed with President Richard Nixon, who in 1974 proposed a comprehensive health reform plan that included cost-sharing health coverage, subsidized by the federal government, for poor Americans. This plan probably would have passed, if not for Watergate.                
                

            
                Trump’s position paper on health care goes on to say that enforcing immigration laws will relieve economic pressures. His wall would theoretically help out hospitals in the South and Southwest that are overburdened by the costs of services they provide to illegal immigrants who can’t pay for them. Meanwhile, the heroin trade is burgeoning, with 300,000 more users than a decade ago and over 10,000 overdose deaths per year. Decreasing these numbers would decrease U.S. health care costs substantially.                
                

            
                So Donald Trump has a health care plan. It needs more flesh on its bones, but at first glance it is not as reckless as his main opponents (both huge ObamaCare critics) say it is. Trump promises to reverse at least some of the damage ObamaCare has done to my patients and me. I believe that if he’s elected, he’ll try.

Sen. Rand Paul's 'Read the Bills Act' - Is it really too much to ask members of Congress to read legislation before they vote on it?,"The median family income for a family of four in the United States these days is approximately $56,500. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate earn $179,000 annually. Each chamber’s leadership makes even more: $193,400. For this kind of money, taxpayers -- who pay these salaries -- might expect their elected representative to do their jobs.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                They don’t.
                
                


                
            
                Legislators are paid to … well, legislate. Legislating means crafting policy proposals, meeting with constituents, holding legislative hearings, and, ultimately, voting. High school students who come to Washington, D.C., still get copies of that perennial civics favorite, “How A Bill Becomes A Law.” But that brochure never discloses the reality of the American legislative process and how it differs significantly from that cheerful civics description.
                
                


                
            
                That situation is what prompted Senator Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, to again propose legislation, timed just as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a new GOP-sponsored health-care-reform bill, mandating that Senators first read legislation before they vote on it. If you are an elected representative, shouldn’t there be a presumption that before you decide how to vote, you actually know what you’re voting on? It’s not acceptable for members just to be told by their party’s Whip how they should vote as they enter the chamber.
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            One of the more revealing comments in this regard was made by then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who was commenting on the proposed Affordable Care Act. She remarkably said that, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” 
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
            
                The “Read the Bills Act"" was first proposed in 2006. Senator Paul endorsed it in 2010 and proposed similar legislation in June 2012. If enacted, the bill would not only promote greater transparency in government by requiring that bills be posted publicly at least 72 hours before a vote, but it would also most certainly produce legislation that was clearer, more coherent, and much shorter.
                
                


                
            
                The new Senate Republican health care proposal is 142 pages long. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Senator John Cornyn, R-Texas, on June 22 whether he had read the new proposal. Senator Cornyn held up the bound text, said that he hadn’t yet read it, but announced that given its relative brevity, he planned to read the bill that evening. By contrast, the Obama administration’s 2010 Affordable Care Act contained some 2,700 pages, roughly the length of Marcel Proust’s “In Search of Lost Time,” one of the longest novels ever written. How many elected officials read that bill?
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Is it really asking too much of our well-paid public servants in Washington to take the time to read and understand legislation before they vote on it? One of the more revealing comments in this regard was made by then Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi who was commenting on the proposed Affordable Care Act. She remarkably said that, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.” At least she was being candid.
                
                


                
            
                Pelosi’s remark, however, stands in sharp contrast to what Congress expects from others. For example, the 2003 Sarbanes-Oxley Act (intended to protect investors from fraudulent accounting practices) requires that chief executives and chief financial officers of publicly traded companies certify with each quarterly-earnings report that they have read their report and that it is accurate. Failure to do so can result in stiff civil penalties and, under certain circumstances, criminal liability. A health-care bill that impacts nearly 18 percent of the country’s gross domestic product has the potential for creating far more harm than almost any corporate quarterly earnings report imaginable.
                
                


                
            
                So why do so many members of Congress not take the time to read bills before they vote? It’s probably not because they are lazy. These men and women are typically Type A, driven individuals. It’s probably not because they are stupid or have short attention spans. You don’t get to serve in Congress -- at least for very long -- if you are intellectually challenged.
                
                


                
            
                The answer is much simpler: they don’t have enough time. And the one reason they don’t have enough time is because they spend an inordinate amount of their time dialing for dollars to fund their next reelection campaign. Some members of Congress have confessed to spending more than 40 percent of their time raising money. American taxpayers, in effect, are subsidizing nonstop electioneering in a manner that precludes their elected representatives from doing their real jobs.
                
                


                
            
                We need an overhaul of how our Congress works, and we can start by mandating that members certify that they have read legislation before they vote on it. Perhaps a more comprehensive bill, the “Making Congress Work for the American People Act,” (with “Work” having more than one meaning) should be considered – a bill that addresses the multiple dysfunctions of our Congress. This legislation could include: (1) banning all fundraising by members whenever Congress is in session, (2) withholding pay from all members if appropriations bills are not completed on time, (3) posting all legislation publicly at least 72 hours before a vote, (4) using technology to track changes in the legislative drafting process to allow more public scrutiny and accountability, (5) extending the Congressional workweek beyond what has now become a routine three days, and (6) having fewer and shorter Congressional recesses.
                
                


                
            
                Something tells me that members of Congress would read every word of this proposed bill. When traditional American pragmatism and common sense merge with today’s resurgent populism on the left and the right, it is likely that members of Congress will change their ways and start delivering for the American people and not just for themselves.

"Will Republicans ever take on Obama’s id, ego and sniping?","March 1, 2012: President Obama waves to the crowd after speaking at a fundraiser in New York City. 
	                        
	                        	 (AP)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd recently wrote about the battles between Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum and the tensions between moderate and conservative Republicans. She says that the party’s “id” or “dark forces” are overwhelming the party’s “ego”—its “common sense and reason.”                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Wall Street Journal columnist William McGurn warns that, “Unless the various constituencies cease their schoolyard sniping, these charges will come back to haunt whoever emerges as the GOP's presidential candidate.”                
                

            
                But what about President Obama’s id, sniping and ego? The president’s id and sniping drive him totally around the bend. For example, he claims -- without support -- that the Republicans’ plan “is let’s have dirtier air, dirtier water, less people with health insurance.”                
                

            
                Yet, for all of Obama’s vilification of Republicans, his ego is so inflated that he dares to portray himself as a unifying blend of common sense and reasonable Republicanism along with a Democrat’s dedication to fairness and equality.                
                

            
                Thus, in October, Obama claimed kinship with Ronald Reagan on closing tax loopholes for the rich: “…26 years ago, another president said that some of these tax loopholes, and I quote, ‘made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing while a bus driver was paying 10 percent of his salary, and that’s crazy. It’s time we stopped it.’ That was 26 years ago. You know the name of that President? Ronald Reagan.”                
                

            
                Conservatives knew Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was a friend of theirs. And Barack Obama, you are no Ronald Reagan.                
                

            
                But Obama’s egotistical audacity is such that he will continue to paint himself in conservative and liberal hues.                
                

            
                Obama did this in a December speech in Kansas: “I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, and when everyone plays by the same rules. Those aren’t Democratic or Republican values; 1% values or 99% values. They’re American values, and we have to reclaim them.”                
                

            
                In that speech, Obama linked himself to Republican president Theodore Roosevelt: “He believed then what we know is true today: that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. But Roosevelt also knew that the free market has never been a free license to take whatever you want from whoever you can. It only works when there are rules of the road to ensure that competition is fair, open, and honest.”                
                

            
                Does Obama plausibly represent the Republicanism of Teddy Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan? Obama’s record shows he speaks loudly but carries a cracked stick.                
                

            
                Obama’s health care reform only passed with outright vote bribery made behind closed—not open—doors. Remember the “Louisiana Purchase” and the “Cornhusker Kickback”? And ObamaCare’s “individual mandate” requiring almost all citizens to buy government-controlled health care by 2014 or face financial penalties is so anti-competitive, unfair and antithetical to a free health care market that 26 states are challenging it and the Supreme Court will decide if the whole law, with its 450 sections, is unconstitutional.                
                

            
                The same bogus attachment to Republican values is in Obama’s other vainglorious legislative “achievement”—the Dodd-Frank regulation overhaul law for financial institutions. According to The Economist magazine, Dodd-Frank’s 848 pages of “rules of the road” are “confused and bloated.”                
                

            
                The Economist catalogs the bureaucratic overreach of Dodd-Frank and writes that, “…one banker immersed in the issue speaks for many when he predicts a decade of grind, with constant disputes in courts and legislatures, finally producing a regime riddled with exceptions and nuances that may, because of its complexity, exacerbate systemic risks rather than mitigate them.”                
                

            
                None of this will deter Obama from combining his id, sniping and ego as he falsely “talks Republican and walks Democratic” in his campaigning and—later—in debates with the Republican nominee.                
                

            
                In 2004, before he addressed the Democratic National Convention, a cocky Obama told David Mendell of The Chicago Tribune, “I'm LeBron, baby. I can play on this level. I got some game.""                
                

            
                Whether it’s comparing himself to Republican superstar presidents or a basketball superstar like LeBron James, President Obama’s id, sniping and ego constitute a game for him.                 
                

            
                If the Republican nominee isn’t skilled enough to expose Obama’s fouls and outscore the president, Obama’s game will dominate for another four years—and the aftereffects will keep dribbling and rebounding for years to come.

Obama’s 'Indefensible' Health Care Plan,"Late in the evening on April 1, the Obama administration filed their official appeal with the 11th Circuit asking the court to overturn federal District Judge Roger Vinson’s pivotal decision declaring the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act unconstitutional.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                They called the decision by federal Judge Roger Vinson “indefensible” and are obviously trying to convince the appeals court that Vinson’s decision is an anomaly that flies against established legal precedent. But are they overcompensating with somewhat dramatic accusations against a respected federal judge’s decision because they realize their arguments in defense of the health care law’s constitutionality are losing steam?                
                

            
                Whether the administration wants to admit it or not, when 26 states, and NFIB, the nation’s largest small business advocacy group, join forces in a lawsuit against a federal law, and a federal district judge rules in their favor, the lawsuit has merit and deserves to be taken seriously.                
                

            
                Constitutional experts from both political parties along with several other district court judges have reached different conclusions over whether or not the individual mandate, or minimum coverage provision, requiring citizens to purchase government approved health insurance, is constitutional. And no one can definitely say how the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately rule on this issue.                
                

            
                What we know for sure, is that by passing the individual mandate, and compelling citizens to purchase a private product, Congress crossed a line that has not been crossed before. For the first time, the federal government is trying to manipulate their power to regulate interstate commerce to encompass forcing citizens to purchase products that they may not want or need.                
                

            
                Does our constitution give Congress the authority to compel citizens to purchase government approved goods and services against their will? Is Congress’ commerce power so broad that it permits the federal government to punish its citizens with a monetary penalty if citizens decide they do not want to purchase the product Congress has deemed to be mandatory? No matter what spin the government tries to put on this case this is the critical issue that needs to be answered by the court.                
                

            
                NFIB joined the lawsuit along with the states because our members, small-business owners nationwide, strongly believe that the constitution does not grant Congress this type of authority over how citizens choose to manage their independent lives. They recognize this is a slippery slope and do not want the federal government in the business of determining what private products or services citizens must purchase.                
                

            
                Proponents of the health care law, along with the administration, have tried to alleviate these fears by arguing that the health insurance market is unique and this uniqueness will somehow prevent Congress from passing similar legislation requiring individuals to purchase other products. But small-business owners, the states, the public, Judge Vinson in Florida and federal district Judge Henry Hudson in Virginia aren’t buying this. If Congress can require citizens to purchase government approved products in the name of health care reform, then there is no legal backstop preventing Congress from regulating citizens to buy other products in the name of any other worthy cause.                
                

            
                A court finding that Congress doesn’t have this authority will not tie Congress’ hands in terms of legislating future health care reforms. The government is correct in arguing that Congress has the authority derived from the Commerce Clause to regulate health insurance companies.                 
                

            
                No one but the administration’s legal team seems to think this is the issue. But regulating insurance companies and the products they sell to willing consumers is not what the individual mandate is all about. It’s about forcing unwilling citizens to purchase insurance products in order to reduce costs for insurance companies and their voluntary customers. These are distinct issues. And they cannot be melded together, from a constitutional stand point, on the grounds that entering into the health care market in one’s lifetime and needing to pay for the services received is inevitable. Many uninsured individuals can and will pay for the health-care services that they will receive, and they cannot be conscripted into the insurance market simply because others will fail to do so.                
                

            
                Congress has the power to regulate the insurance industry; they’ve done so for years. In passing PPACA, they chose to reach further and are now trying to regulate an individual’s personal decision not to participate in the insurance market. This is unprecedented and threatens to undermine any constitutional limits on Congress’ commerce power that exist today.                
                

            
                Congress knew this when they passed the bill, and President Obama knew it when he signed it into law. They also purposively passed the Act without a severability clause and have consistently argued that the individual mandate is integral to how this Act should operate. Yet the administration tries to caveat this argument by claiming that if (and only if) the court finds the mandate to be unconstitutional, then the rest of the provisions of the Act could stand on their own. Rings a bit duplicitous doesn’t it?                
                

            
                Despite what the government may want the 11th Circuit to believe, rejecting the government’s arguments and determining that the entire law is unconstitutional is anything but indefensible. NFIB, and the 26 states that have joined this lawsuit, look forward to proving this as our case proceeds.

              In the first six months of this administration, President Donald Trump has fought every day to deliver on his promises to the American people. At a historic pace, this president has taken bold action to restore prosperity, keep Americans safe and secure, and hold government accountable.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump has signed more than 40 bills and nearly 40 executive orders on everything from health care to energy, infrastructure and more.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While the previous administration turned to federal agencies to enact its agenda, President Trump has signed more laws to slash through federal red tape than any president in American history and has saved businesses up to $18 billion a year in costs.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              And whereas the last administration stifled the use of America’s vast energy resources, President Trump has put a renewed emphasis on American energy – approving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, rolling back the Clean Power Plan, and putting America First by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump inherited an economy that would barely budge – but under his watch, American businesses small and large have already created more than 800,000 new jobs since January. Company after company is responding to the president’s agenda with optimism – investing billions of dollars in American jobs, American workers and America’s future.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As the father of a United States Marine, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a president who cares so deeply about the men and women of the armed forces of the United States of America. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              After years of so-called “sequestration” and budget cuts to our armed forces, President Trump has already signed the largest increase in defense spending in nearly 10 years and called for the greatest investment in military readiness since the days of President Ronald Reagan.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every single day to restore an America of freedom, prosperity and opportunity for all.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              And this president calls our enemy by its name – radical Islamic terrorism – and with the leadership of this commander-in-chief our armed forces are taking the fight to ISIS on our terms on their soil. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              When it comes to security here in the homeland, President Trump has taken decisive steps to secure our borders and enforce our laws – a direct contrast with the previous administration.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And while illegal immigration was rampant in recent years, our administration has been working with local law enforcement to take drug dealers, members of gangs like MS-13, and other violent criminals off our streets. Illegal crossings at our southern border are down by more than 60 percent since the start of this year. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              After the previous president tried to stack the courts with liberal jurists, our president made a commitment to appoint federal judges who will uphold the Constitution and the God-given liberties enshrined there.

              President Trump’s accomplishments are nothing short of historic. But as the president likes to say, at this White House that's just what we call a good start.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump will not rest and he will not relent until we keep our promise to the American people and repeal and replace ObamaCare.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump has called on the Congress to do its job, and we will continue to work with both the House and Senate to give the American people health care reform built on the principles of personal responsibility, free-market competition and state-based reforms.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              President Trump is firmly committed to passing the largest tax cut since the days of President Reagan. We’re going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We’ll simplify the tax code. We’ll eliminate the alternative minimum tax. We’ll make the code flatter and fairer for everyone. And under President Trump, we will repeal death taxes once and for all. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And to get this economy moving again, we’re going to cut business taxes in America so that companies in this country can compete with companies around the world and create good jobs right here in America. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We’ll end the broken system that penalizes companies for calling America home. And we’ll cut taxes on trillions of dollars that are locked away overseas so that American businesses can invest in America’s future.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as vice president to a president who is fighting every single day to restore an America of freedom, prosperity and opportunity for all.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So with boundless faith in the American people, with faith in President Trump’s vision and determination, and with faith in God who has ever watched over this Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, I say with confidence: We will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And to borrow a phrase, we will Make America Great Again.

              With special counsel Bob Mueller filing charges against Trump associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates this week, a divided country is quickly moving on from last week’s controversy of the “Steele Dossier.”
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The scandalou series of memos – which contained allegations of treason and impropriety by then-candidate Trump and his campaign – took on renewed life after it was confirmed that the document was little more than a political hit job paid for by both Democratic and Republican operatives.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But while the headlines may shift, Mueller’s attention to a dossier-related scandal must not. Indeed, the dossier is almost certainly connected to the most audacious crime of the 2016 campaign.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              America’s senior law enforcement and intelligence officials were directly involved in the targeting of a democratically elected president for political assassination.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Here’s how.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Recall that the dossier first gained widespread attention and credibility after then CIA Director John Brennan, DNI Director James Clapper, and FBI Director James Comey briefed a summary of the document to a small group of D.C. leaders, including President Obama and then President-elect Trump.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              Knowledge of the classified briefing leaked in the press shortly thereafter.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In the days that followed, the New York Times raised a critical question. By spreading the dossier throughout D.C.’s political class, the nation’s spymasters virtually assured that the document’s allegations would be leaked and given undue credibility.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              So why did they do it?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The official response from Brennan, Clapper, and Comey was that they simply wanted to give policymakers the “fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              After all, they added, America’s politicians “may hear about it.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Curiously, however, these spymasters also said that they gave the document no particular credence after having investigated its treasonous allegations.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To any reasonable person, this makes absolutely no sense. Why brief a document about Trump’s alleged treason, knowing it would leak to the press, when you had already investigated the accusations and found them to be without merit?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Indeed, when President Obama was briefed on the dossier and the spymasters’ justification for doing so, his incredulous response captured the confusion perfectly.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              “What does this have anything to do with anything?”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              America is thus left with an important question first raised by the New York Times some 10 months ago but, conveniently enough, left unanswered.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Why would our senior intelligence and law enforcement officials bother highlighting a debunked dossier when they knew it would leak to the press, thereby giving it a degree of credibility and life it wouldn’t otherwise deserve?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              There are three possible answers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              First, one or all of these spymasters may have been influenced by their profound dislike of Trump as a person. From the “locker room” comments to fights with Hollywood personalities, even Trump supporters often find his conduct unpresidential.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A strategy of “brief and leak” would certainly be an effective revenge.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A second possibility is that these officials and their political chiefs may have been spooked by known or suspected connections between Trump’s campaign and Russian operatives. After all, they had heard months of Trump’s allegedly “soft views” on Russia and its former spy president, Vladimir Putin.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In short, Obama officials may have been fearful that a “corrupted” President Trump would shut down any collusion investigation before the facts were known.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Putting aside whether there’s any truth to these fears, it would still be wildly illegal for America’s spymasters to leak information to the media designed to damage a president. Officials working for the CIA and FBI are strictly regulated regarding their political activity, not to mention barred from disclosing classified or protected government information. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And that suggests a third and much more likely motivation of the intentional leakers: politics.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The Obama administration had every reason to believe that Trump and a Republican Congress would reverse Obama’s legacy – from the nuclear deal with Iran to health care reform. Republicans were also poised to add several conservative Supreme Court justices to the court, altering the direction of the country for decades to come.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s reasonable to believe, then, that leaking a dossier alleging treason might severely wound Trump and his agenda for the duration of his presidency.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Which begs the question: which spymaster had the greatest motivation to try to bring down the president? And was he alone in his efforts?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Here’s what we know.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              On June 8, 2017, former FBI Director Comey acknowledged that he had a secret relationship with at least one newspaper with whom he shared classified or proprietary government information that advanced articles critical of the president.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Subsequent analysis showed that the former director might have been engaged in this covert media operation for far longer and in many more press placements than he has acknowledged to date.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We also know that Comey could manipulate D.C.’s culture of leaks to accomplish his personal agenda. When asked whether he anticipated the leak of a letter to Congress on a separate matter, he replied, “Of course. I know how Congress works.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In sum, Comey admitted to having the motivation, access, and ability to conduct what would effectively be a covert influence operation designed to damage the president.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              But did he act alone? Reporting by the New York Times suggests not.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to the Grey Lady, there was a wholesale effort by the Obama administration to spread or disseminate classified information throughout the government and into the public domain that dealt with possible contacts between associates of Trump and the Russians.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In short, there were others – many others – who were joining Comey in a similar “brief to leak” operation designed to throw sand in the gears of a Trump presidency.   
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Regardless of who was involved or their precise motivation, one thing is certain: the spymasters’ decision to spread the dossier’s accusations contributed to nearly a year of political chaos that has roiled the nation.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Indeed, opponents of the president have repeatedly used the dossier as the foundation for their call for his impeachment. Democrats like chief investigator Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., highlight the document and its foreign author again and again to proclaim or suggest that Trump was either a secret Russian agent or had been blackmailed into doing Moscow’s bidding.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The message was clear: Trump must go.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Yet even if one agrees that Trump is not fit to serve, voters of all stripes should be outraged by the spymasters’ attempts to damage him. Indeed, one can disagree with Trump’s agenda or find him personally distasteful but that does not give license to ignore unlawful behavior by America’s law enforcement and intelligence communities.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Said differently, we cannot support an illicit political assassination simply because it brings about misfortune to those we oppose.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Accordingly, it’s time for Mueller to investigate our national security community with the same ferocity that he’s shown in his likely prosecution of Trump associates.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s time to investigate the scandal of America’s spymasters.

                It’s now been officially one month since President Obama launched his health insurance exchange and broken website. Over the past few weeks, it’s become clear that the problems with the health care law go well beyond a failed website. The technical problems are just the tip of the iceberg.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Nearly every promise made by the Obama administration has been broken.                 
                

            
                The president’s latest speeches and the testimony of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have just amounted to more spin.

                The health exchange has not been as easy to use as Amazon.com.

                People are finding their plans are not as cheap as a cell phone bill.                 
                

            
                Their family’s doctors may not even be covered by their new insurance.                
                

            
                President Obama should admit to the American people that his law doesn’t provide the affordable, accessible health care coverage that they wanted all along. Then he should come to the table with Republicans to give people the real health care reform that they need, that they want, and that they deserve.                
                

            
                As we all remember, President Obama also promised repeatedly that if you liked the insurance you had, you could keep it. It turns out that only if the White House likes your plan can you keep it – if not, you’re out of luck. In fact, the Administration knew for years that up to 16 million people across the country could lose their insurance. Rather than being honest with the American people, they chose to hide the problem.                
                

            
                Now millions of people who are getting cancellation letters from their insurance company know the truth. In New Jersey alone, 800,000 cancellation letters have gone out.                
                

            
                When these people and others start shopping for new insurance, many will find the premiums are much higher. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina told one customer that his current plan doesn’t meet benefit requirements of the President’s health care law. It suggested a comparable plan for $1,208 a month – $980 more than he pays now.                
                

            
                A woman in California faced a 50 percent rate hike. She wrote to her insurance company, “I was all for Obamacare until I found out I was paying for it.”                
                

            
                For a lot of people, the law means more than skyrocketing premiums. Their new policies will come with higher co-pays and bigger deductibles – triple what they have now in some cases.                
                

            
                After people recover from the sticker shock of their new Washington-approved and mandated insurance, there will be more negative consequences. Many will find that their own doctor is no longer eligible to treat them under their plan. A recent survey of physician practices found that only 29 percent say they’ll take insurance sold through the government exchange. The rest have either decided not to participate or are still making up their minds.                
                

            
                Finally, if all that weren’t bad enough, people trying to buy insurance through the exchange face increased risk of fraud and identity theft. Con artists are taking advantage of the Obama Administration’s bungling by setting up fake websites and phishing scams.                
                

            
                The Democrats’ whole law was based on the idea that government is capable of running America’s health care system competently. It turns out that the government can’t even set up a website competently – and they knew it.                
                

            
                The Obama administration also knows that it will have to delay implementation of the individual mandate by at least a year. The failure has been too widespread to fix quickly. This delay needs to be approved by Congress through the regular legislative process. It should not be another case where the President waves his magic wand to change the law how he wants, when he wants.                
                

            
                Democrats got the American people into this mess unilaterally. It’s time for a bipartisan solution to get us out.

                ""The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans,"" Jack Kennedy famously said in his 1961 inaugural address, a phrase once swollen with optimism and American pride.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It may be tempting for President Obama to use this same expression now to describe Health and Human Services Secretary (Baby Boomer) Sebelius handing off the HHS secretarial torch to her apparent (Generation X) replacement, Sylvia Burwell, but such a sentiment would be false optimism.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                It is time for a physician or an expert in health care to administer Health and Human Services, not another numbers-massaging manager, no matter how able.                 
                

            
                It is easy to forget that Secretary Sebelius was once Kansas Insurance Commissioner. This qualified her to administer health insurance, not health care.                 
                

            
                Though she certainly helped to fumble the ObamaCare website rollout, an even greater misdeed was her inability to anticipate how the arrival of ObamaCare could translate into less care and less access and higher premiums for those who already have insurance.                
                

            
                HHS stands for ""Health and Human Services,"" not Health and Insurance Services. Only a doctor who deals with ObamaCare every day can attest to the problems the growing insurance bureaucracy pose to actual patient care.                 
                

            
                Here are some actual questions that come up in my office:                  
                

            
                1. Is that patient eligible to see Dr. Siegel or is his insurance expired?                 
                

            
                2. How come Dr. Siegel is listed as a Blue Cross provider but is not part of the Blue Cross network for policies offered on the state exchange?                 
                

            
                3. Can Dr. Siegel's patient Victoria Scott afford the care she needs for her thyroid condition when she has a whooping deductible (almost $6000) on her Bronze plan?                
                

            
                It hardly matters to doctors and their patients what the cumulative numbers are for new enrollees on the state exchanges, and how many of these folks were actually uninsured beforehand (the latest RAND data suggests less than half). What matters most is what kind of care these patients can get and at what cost, and whether we doctors can still afford to take care of them.                
                

            
                Sylvia Burwell said at a recent Atlantic magazine event that the Affordable Care Act “is about improving access…about improving the quality of health care.”                 
                

            
                Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the new law does either one.                
                

            
                Contrast Burwell’s abstract statement to the practical wisdom of Senator John Barrasso, M.D., a practicing orthopedist for many years and former Wyoming Physician of the Year.                 
                

            
                He wrote in Investor’s Business Daily about how ObamaCare interferes with the real world doctor/patient relationship: “I continue to hear from my patients in Wyoming. They have always had my home phone number. They are anxious and angry. They know what they wanted from health care reform: access to quality, affordable care…That's not what they got with this law. Now, many face losing the doctor who has always been there for them.”                
                

            
                Dr. Barrasso would make a terrific HHS secretary, unfortunately, President Obama would likely never consider such a move.                 
                

            
                Sylvia Burwell may be a capable budget director, and her track record with the Clinton administration, the Gates and Walmart Foundations certainly shows that she is an able politician, but where is the evidence that she can manage a health care system that is becoming more complex by the day?                
                

            
                In the era of personalized health care, where genetic advances in cancer research and risk assessment predict both diseases and their expensive treatments on a patient by patient basis, the one-size-fits-all insurance model is becoming increasingly out of date. The more complex our health care solutions, the more unaffordable or inadequate ObamaCare will be.                
                

            
                Sylvia Burwell may do a better job presenting the latest insurance numbers to the public, but she will be no more qualified in deciding whether an 11-year-old like Sarah Murnaghan should get a life-saving lung transplant with adult lungs than Kathleen Sebelius was.                
                

            
                HHS needs a physician or at least a bio-engineer to navigate through the treacherous ObamaCare waters, not another insurance expert to sell us yet another policy to cover our mammograms and our colonoscopies even as our collective ship sinks

                I do solemnly swear that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich; and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge all the duties incumbent on me as according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the constitution and laws of the United States.                
                

            
                That oath, with only minor changes, is the same one taken by Supreme Court justices to this day. Thankfully, Chief Justice John Roberts was paying attention when he repeated it.
 
 The individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act aka ""ObamaCare"" was always, clearly constitutional — so much so that conservatives, recall, were not only the ones who came up with the idea in the first place but generally scoffed at legal challenges when they first raised.                 
                

            
                “It’s become just a very partisan battle cry on behalf of an argument which a few years ago was thought to be completely bogus,” said Charles Fried, President Ronald Reagan’s Solicitor General in Supreme Court cases 1985 to 1989.  
 
 It’s one thing to not like a law. It’s another to suggest that the highest court in the land should overturn centuries of precedent, not to mention the clear tax and commerce power enshrined by our Founders in the Constitution, in order to serve a partisan political agenda.                 
                

            
                In a recent survey conducted by Bloomberg News, 19 of 21 constitutional law scholars — across political affiliations — agreed that the individual mandate in health care reform is constitutional.  Thankfully, conservative Chief Justice Roberts joined the majority decision and ruled that, whether he personally likes it or not, Congress has the power to mandate health insurance coverage.
 
 In 2008, over 88 percent of Americans agreed our health care system was in desperate need of reform. President Obama put forward a plan not to create single payer Medicare system for all (as his progressive base, including myself, wanted) but to fix the crisis of runaway costs and 37 million uninsured Americans by bolstering the private insurance market with the individual mandate.                 
                

            
                It was not accidental that this centerpiece of his plan originated in conservative think tanks and was supported by, among others, Senator John McCain during his run for president.  President Obama went to pains to present a bipartisan solution to our health care crisis.                  
                

            
                Republicans? They did an ideological about-face, declared their wrath against the individual mandate and voted in a block against the Affordable Care Act. Conservatives have been trying to use health care reform as a political football ever since.
 
 Chief Justice Roberts’ vote is so striking precisely because it bucks the recent trend of conservatives contorting their own past beliefs and principles to attack President Obama in any way possible.                  
                

            
                It’s no coincidence that, today, the very same Republicans who decried Congress wasting taxpayer resources on “witch hunts” when George W. Bush was president have launched a grandiose fishing expedition against Attorney General Eric Holder -- not because of ""Fast & Furious,"" which has long been addressed, but because of some far-fetched conspiracy theory about the Justice Department’s own internal investigation.                 
                

            
                To ordinary Americans watching this exchange, it would appear that Republicans are against Congressional committee witch hunts, unless Democrats are the targets, just as Republicans support individual mandate solutions within the private insurance market, unless Democrats propose the idea.                  
                

            
                In 2006, Mitt Romney praised the individual mandate as the solution to our nation’s health care challenges. Now, he has joined the rest of his opportunistic party in condemning it.                 
                

            
                The American public is getting increasingly sick of conservatives flip-flopping on their supposedly core beliefs simply to try and score points against President Obama.  And the Tea Party, which keeps trying to oust any Republican who shows an ounce bipartisanship, isn’t helping.                 
                

            
                Fortunately, no matter how increasingly powerful the extreme right of the Republican Party becomes, they cannot oust Chief Justice John Roberts.                
                

            
                I’m not going to say  that I wasn’t surprised by today's ruling.                
                

            
                A quarter century ago, 2 out of 3 Americans approved of the job the Supreme Court was doing. Today, less than half of Americans feel the same way -- in no small part because 3 out of 4 Americans believe that the justices’ decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal beliefs.                 
                

            
                The Roberts' Court leans right and a number of 5-4 decisions along party lines have overturned centuries of precedent to serve partisan aims (see, e.g., Parents v. Seattle, Gonzalez v. Carhart and of course Citizens United).                  
                

            
                But look, America, sometimes justice manages to be blind to politics and sometimes, just sometimes, even conservatives on the Court realize that we have a federal government for good reason. And, too, sometimes the Constitution that conservatives love to pay lip service to confers all kinds of legitimate powers to government.  It’s a good thing Chief Justice Roberts referred to the Constitution in his decision, and not Twitter.                
                

            
                In Marbury v. Madison, the Court wrote: “The Government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.” Far too often and far more frequently, the five conservative men on the Supreme Court have put politics ahead of the law.                  
                

            
                Today, Chief Justice Roberts upheld a vital act of Congress that will bring down our health care costs, improve the quality of our care and make sure 37 million uninsured Americans have access to affordable insurance.                 
                

            
                But Chief Justice Roberts also upheld the integrity of the Supreme Court on which he sits. We can only hope that today's ruling is a significant step toward restoring the sort of independent rationalism and truth we so desperately needs. In a country far too blinded by partisanship, justice may not really be blind but hopefully it can see better than the rest of us.

              The Trump administration stands on the verge of a big win, or a significant defeat on this Friday, July 21. It’s the Republican Party that decides which way it’s going to go.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              You know the story. We are 6 months into this presidency and so far, the republican Congress has delivered very little. Now, it’s crunch-time: next week the senate will vote on ObamaCare, and after that, its tax reform.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Just for a moment think about what it would mean for the economy and for Middle America, if the president gets a win on both! You get to choose what health insurance you want, and you get to keep more of the money you make! Isn't that what republican voters, voted for?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I try to steer clear of stock market predictions: we leave that to our guests, but i have to tell you, that almost everyone who has appeared on “Varney & co.” says that your investments will do even better if the republicans deliver and so will the economy. The Republican Party holds the key.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And if they don't come through, watch out! Again, I don't make predictions, but the people who are paid to forecast are unanimous: no health care reform, no tax cuts. Watch out below.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              That’s the economic side of the argument: politically, there's just as much at stake. Our perception of the Trump presidency will change dramatically, if he gets a win: if he doesn't, the media will become even more contemptuous than it is now. They'll call him a failure. A lame duck after only a year.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              This presidency is now in the hands of the Republican Party.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              And the future of the Republican Party is in the hands of the Republican Party.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s Friday, July 21 and we're on the brink, America.

Health care and health insurance are not the same thing - the fundamental disconnect in health care reform,"Politicians from both sides of the aisle continue to show a troubling disconnect from basic principles in their approach to health care reform. Among their many debates about changing health care, the single most essential reform – reducing the cost of health care itself - is typically underemphasized or even entirely absent from the discussion.  Yet that is the fundamental avenue to broader access to care, lower insurance premiums, and ultimately better health.
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                Instead, legislators continue to erroneously focus on increasing the percentage of people with health insurance. But the disregarded reality is that health insurance premiums are only a secondary manifestation of other factors, chiefly the cost of medical care and to a lesser extent the regulatory environment for insurance.
                
                


                
            
                In a misguided attempt to insure more people at all cost, the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) doles out over $1 trillion of tax revenues to subsidize premiums and adds numerous regulations and taxes, many of which counterproductively increase premiums.  At this point, there should be no need to debate the harmful impacts of this approach – insurance premiums skyrocket; insurers withdraw from the marketplace; and for those with coverage, doctor and hospital choices narrow dramatically.
                
                


                
            
                What is baffling is that today’s Republican-dominated House and Senate both continue to focus on making insurance “more affordable,” mainly through cash to consumers in refundable tax credits.  By ignoring the root problem, such policies artificially prop up insurance premiums for coverage that often minimizes out-of-pocket payment. This shields medical care providers from competing on price. While emerging GOP proposals rightfully strip back some of the ACA’s harmful regulations and taxes, far more emphasis is urgently needed on reducing medical care costs, the core cause underlying high insurance costs.
                
                


                
            
                It is also particularly disturbing that our own elected leaders ignore what we all should have already learned from those countries boasting about a fully insured population under socialized medicine. In those countries with government insurance for all, epitomized by the shameful NHS of the United Kingdom, their “insured” patients have far worse access to care for even the sickest patients. There are unconscionable delays for those needing urgent treatment for already diagnosed cancer (17% wait more than two months) and already recommended brain surgery (17% wait more than 18 weeks); delayed access to important medications; and factually worse outcomes from serious diseases like cancer, heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and diabetes compared to Americans pre-ObamaCare. Indeed, having insurance is not at all synonymous with having access to quality medical care.
                
                


                
            
                Lowering the cost of medical care itself, though, is fraught with peril. It must be achieved without harming patients. That means without jeopardizing quality, restricting access, or inhibiting critical innovation of American medical care that - based on peer-reviewed data throughout the leading medical journals (see, for example, reviews such as In Excellent Health ) - is the standard of excellence for the world.
                
                


                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                We first must create an environment where consumers care about prices and receive benefit from seeking value. But is it even realistic to suggest that people could shop for medical care and seek value, as Americans do for virtually every other good and service?
                
                


                
            
                Some medical care, including emergency care, obviously does not lend itself to price consideration. But emergency care represents only six percent of health care expenditures.
                
                


                
            
                Among privately insured adults under age 65, almost 60 percent of all health expenditures is for elective outpatient care; only 20 percent is spent on inpatient care and 21 percent on medications. Likewise, 60 percent of Medicaid money is spent for outpatient care. Even in the elderly, almost 40 percent of expenses are for outpatient care. Of the top one percent of spenders, the group responsible for more than 25 percent of all health spending at an average of $100,000 per person per year, a full 45 percent of care is also outpatient. Outpatient health care services dominate America’s health spending, and these are amenable to value-based decisions.
                
                


                
            
                To fully leverage consumer power on health care prices, consumers must have an expanded role in directly paying for their care. Higher deductible insurance plans (HDHPs) are vehicles to position patients as direct payers for a higher proportion of their medical care. These plans are most effective when combined with large health savings accounts. When people have a reason to shop for value - when they have growing savings to protect in HSAs - the cost of care comes down without harmful impact on health. When paired with HSAs, spending of those with HDHPs decreased at least 15% annually in a March 2015 study. More than one-third of the savings by enrollees in such coverage reflected value-based decision-making by consumers. Cheaper, limited mandate, high deductible coverage; markedly expanded HSAs; and targeted tax incentives to expand their use are key to reducing medical care prices.
                
                


                
            
                Leveraging the power of seniors, the biggest users of health care, is also important. The expected tripling of health expenses for a 65-year-old by 2030 projected by HealthView makes HSAs even more relevant, particularly since today’s seniors with their longer lifespan need to save money for decades, not years, of future health care.
                
                


                
            
                In addition, reforms must eliminate the artificial constraints on the supply of medical care. Although less publicized, almost two-thirds of the 2025 projected doctor shortage of 124,000 will be in specialists, not primary care. Medical school graduation numbers have stagnated for almost 40 years. Severe protectionist residency training program restrictions have been in place for decades. And archaic non-reciprocal licensing by states unnecessarily limits specialist patient care, especially as telemedicine proliferates. These anti-consumer practices need to be open to public scrutiny and abolished.
                
                


                
            
                Primary care specifically could be far less costly with immediate modernization. Nurse practitioners and physician assistants can provide the vast majority of routine primary care, including flu shots, blood pressure monitoring, and prescription renewals. In a 2011 review, 88 percent of visits to retail clinics involved relatively simple care, 30–40 percent cheaper than at physician offices and about 80 percent cheaper than at emergency departments.  These clinics can potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars per year with high patient satisfaction.  We need to simplify credentialing requirements for such clinics, and states should remove outmoded scope-of-practice limits on nurse practitioners and physician assistants.
                
                


                
            
                The primary goal of health reform should be to reduce the costs of medical care, not to increase the number of insurance holders.  Beyond regulatory reform and tax repeal, specific mechanisms to reduce the prices of health care without harming access, quality, or innovation have been proven effective, and they should be the focus of health care reform.  Everything else follows.

                Five days into the 1993 calendar – 15 days before his White House stay concluded – George H.W. Bush traveled to West Point for one last presidential address.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The event was short on bells and whistles. Gray-uniformed Army cadets provided the backdrop. The event opened with the National Emblem March and wrapped up with the West Point March. Bush’s reward for making the trek up the Hudson River: a cadet parka – a curious bit of clothing for a Navy man.                
                

            
                Bush 41 was all business that solemn day. He chose the venue to impart wisdom on what role the attending future warriors would play in global theatres. He chose not to pat himself on the back for peacefully concluding the Cold War and humiliating Saddam Hussein, but instead outlined America’s commitments as a triumphant superpower in a reshaped world.                
                

            
                Fast-forward 14 years and five days to Chicago’s Lakeside Center at McCormick Place and President Obama’s Tuesday evening “farewell address” before an effusive crowd – the second time, now, that an outgoing president said goodbye in a venue beyond the nation’s capital.

                Two things you should know about Obama’s last hurrah:                
                

            
                First, it wasn’t so much “farewell” as “to be continued”.                
                

            
                Come a week from Friday, Obama will be the first ex-president since Woodrow Wilson to stay in Washington once his administration ends.                
                

            
                On Tuesday night, Obama made it clear that, unlike the enfeebled Wilson (or the gracious George W. Bush, for that matter), he plans to be quite vocal – on everything from illegal immigration, replacing ObamaCare, climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal – if he feels the necessity.                
                

            
                Second, Obama chose the moment and the setting (it’s where he gave his victory speech on Election Night 2012) to bask in idolatry rather than say much that will stand the test of time.                
                

            
                As such, it was a disappointing finale to a presidency that, too often and in too many different ways, placed too high of a premium on celebrity status and cult of personality – an American colossus ruled by Narcissus.                
                

            
                Here’s a list of presidential farewell addresses, from the pre-modern written versions to this generation’s televised goodbyes.                
                

            
                They include our nation’s first President George Washington establishing a peaceful transfer of power, Andrew Jackson showcasing populism, Dwight Eisenhower warning of a “military-industrial complex” and Ronald Reagan embracing of a “shining city on a hill”.                
                

            
                Those and most other presidential farewell tended to be futuristic in their substance. Big-picture speeches.                
                

            
                And Obama?                
                

            
                He did go big-picture in the beginning, tapping the Founding Fathers and the concept of a more perfect union and a republic defined by generational embraces of American exceptionalism. And he lamented the current “state of democracy” – Americans needing to set aside their differences for the good of the nation’s solidarity.                
                

            
                However, too much of the 54-minute address was devoted to a recitation and defense of a progressive record.                
                

            
                Obama talked up the broadening the definition of marriage, rebooting relations with Cuba and what he claims to be a healthier economy with poverty on the wane.                
                

            
                On the topic of inequality, he referenced “a new social compound” that’s, in effect, a back door to more unionization, more social-program spending and higher taxation of the affluent.                
                

            
                Get used to more of this. Part of Obama’s post-presidency will include revamping Organizing for Action, a group born from his campaign machine and tasked with candidate recruitment.                
                

            
                Obama also claimed that race relations have improved over the recent decades, arguably his wobbliest words as (a) he removed his presidency from the equation and (b) in a city fraught with intra-racial homicides, it was just five days ago that four black Chicagoans were arrested for torturing a white special-needs teen live on Facebook.                
                

            
                However, the topic of race was also one of Obama’s stronger moments: calling on white Americans to better understand minority struggles with equality; minorities learning to better appreciate white struggles with a changing economy. “We all have to try harder,” he neatly surmised.                
                

            
                Still, Obama couldn’t resist the subtle dig at his successor (“science and reason matter”) and the loyal opposition (“how can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, not when we’re cutting taxes for corporations?”), even if it was cloaked in a nobler call for both parties to stop engaging in double standards.                
                

            
                Not until nearly midway into his remarks did the only president to serve an entire two terms with a nation at war delve into terrorism.                
                

            
                Not that it was much a deep dive.                
                

            
                The former constitutional law professor rolled ISIS into a big ball of human rights, women’s right and LBGT rights – and from there, naturally, protecting voting rights and a closing passage in which Obama called for his countrymen to became a nation of community organizers.                  
                

            
                Add it up and, for one last time, America was witness to the Obama paradox. Twice, this very personable man was elected to the nation’s highest office. He’ll leave office with healthy approval numbers.                
                

            
                Yet on three separate occasions – two midterm elections and Hillary Clinton’s ill-fated stab at “hope” and “change” – the American people rejected the man’s ideas and ideology.                
                

            
                One good thing about star power, as Obama showed this one last time as president: it means not going unnoticed.                
                

            
                Back in 2009, George W. Bush’s press minions had to grovel for airtime for their boss’s farewell address from the East Room of the White House. This time around, none of the three major television networks balked at granting Obama coverage live and in primetime.                
                

            
                And good television it was.                
                

            
                As per usual, the words were melodic. The crowd was spellbound; a fawning media will swoon over the passages.                
                

            
                But with Obama it’s always been a temporary high – a long, rhetorical nitrous oxide hit before returning to the sobering realities of a sluggish economy, flawed health care reform, a socially divided nation and a world stage dotted with bad actors.                
                

            
                Despite the lofty language, the kind optics and the man’s cool presence on stage, Obama’s party paid a terrible price down-ticket in congressional, gubernatorial and state legislative numbers. Last November, the electorate handed the presidency to a man who’s the anti-Obama in taste, temperament, experience and execution.                
                

            
                Saying farewell can be hard – especially when one’s party has been left in the dust.

                Editor's note: The following column originally appeared in The Hill newspaper and TheHill.com.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                                 
                

            
                This Saturday marks President Trump’s 100th day in office.                
                

            
                On Day One, after listening to Trump’s inaugural address, former President George W. Bush reportedly said: “That was some weird s--t.”                
                

            
                The GOP establishment still holds that view after 100 days of President Trump.                
                

            
                And Democrats are also offering “We Told You So” looks to all who voted for Trump.                
                

            
                Trump’s most striking achievement in his first three months is being the least popular new president in modern history.                
                

            
                A majority of Americans – 52 percent — disapprove of his job performance as president, according to the most recent Gallup tracking poll, released Saturday.                
                

            
                Even Trump’s supporters have to admit these first three months have been defined by the administration’s failure to deliver on campaign promises.                
                

            
                For all of Trump’s talk about being a great dealmaker, the flashing lights on the political scoreboard read as follows:                
                

            
                No repeal of ObamaCare. No tax reform. No Muslim travel ban — in the sense that the attempt to enact one is bogged down in the courts — and no evidence to support the incredible claim that President Obama had Trump wiretapped.                
                

            
                There is also no wall on the southern border and no indication that Mexico will pay for it.                
                

            
                And in the last few weeks, the reversals on campaign promises have come thick and fast.                
                

            
                Now Trump approves of the Export-Import Bank. Now Trump is no longer a fan of the border adjustment tax. Now he believes in NATO. Now China will not be listed as a currency manipulator. Now Janet Yellen is a good chairwoman of the Federal Reserve.                
                

            
                Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) put all the flip-flops in delicate terms so as not to offend the Trump faithful:                
                

            
                “I think President Trump is learning the job and some of the things that were said during the campaign I think he now knows — that’s simply not the way things ought to be.”                
                

            
                Trump’s singular success was getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court.                
                

            
                But the credit for that win should properly go to the Heritage Foundation and the conservative legal minds at the Federalist Society. They compiled a list of their favorite conservative judges and handed it to Trump.                
                

            
                Now, let’s look ahead to Trump’s next 100 days.                
                

            
                The biggest threat to Trump is the split between him and Republicans in Congress.                
                

            
                He has proven to be a weight on Republican congressional candidates in two special elections in Kansas and Georgia.                
                

            
                FiveThirtyEight forecaster Harry Enten tweeted earlier this month that the House GOP caucus is in the worst position of any party holding the House majority since 1954, when voters were first asked their preference for which party rules the House.                
                

            
                That ballot question was simply, “If the election were held today, would you vote for the Republican or the Democratic candidate?” Enten’s average of the polls has the Republicans down by six points.                
                

            
                There is more than a year for the Republicans to dig out from there, but it is a big hole.                
                

            
                That gives Republicans every reason to start distancing themselves from the Trump White House. Democrats are already standing far away.                
                

            
                Yet Trump needs Congress’s help right now to avoid a government shutdown.                
                

            
                After a two-week Easter recess, Congress returns to work tomorrow with just four days left until funding for current government operations is set to expire on April 29.                
                

            
                The top two Senate Republicans, McConnell and Majority Whip John Cornyn (Texas) are going out of their way to call for a bipartisan, stop-gap funding measure to stave off a shutdown.                
                

            
                “We’ll be talking to Senate Democrats,” McConnell said before Easter. “They will be relevant to the process. It will require 60 votes. I’m confident that Senate Democrats are not going to want to shut down the government.”                
                

            
                So now we have leading Republicans calling on President Trump to work with the Democrats.                
                

            
                But Democrats know that Trump’s plans for future budgets anger their base. So why would they help him?                
                

            
                The Trump blueprint for future budgets, released last month, outlined draconian cuts to funds that support popular education, social welfare and economic development programs. Meals on wheels for the elderly and afterschool programs for disadvantaged youths were two that invited public outcry.                
                

            
                Trump recently said he remains focused on health reform and is threatening to withhold subsidies to insurance companies to force Democrats to help him pass a bill to replace ObamaCare.                
                

            
                ""Health care [reform] is going to happen at some point,” the president told my Fox colleague Maria Bartiromo. “Now, if it doesn't happen fast enough, I'll start the taxes. But the tax reform and the tax cuts are better if I can do health care first.""                
                

            
                If you are a Democrat who enjoyed the disastrous GOP civil war over their health care bill, then you are going to love the upcoming GOP slugfest over spending and taxes. If past is prologue then Trump will be frustrated, and fail to get his tax and spending plans passed by the splintered GOP Congress.                
                

            
                His biggest success will be in driving down the GOP’s poll numbers as the midterm elections get closer by the day.

"Trump's first 100 Days, Hillary Clinton and America's missed opportunity","Now Playing                            Trump Presidency approaches first 100 days                                                                                                 
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                I’m a Hillary Clinton fangirl and I feel no shame.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                She was the most qualified candidate to run for president in history – we all should be Hillary Clinton fangirls.                
                

            
                Does that mean I don’t see her faults? Of course not.                
                

            
                She had a flawed message (I’ll get back to you when I figure out what “stronger together” actually means). She had a private email server and bungled the explanation. She didn’t surround herself with new faces on the campaign trail. She didn’t go to Wisconsin. She didn’t learn valuable lessons from the primary about sentiment within the white working class community. She overplayed the gender card, even with the role of misogyny in the election which was very real and powerful.                
                

            
                I could go on and I could certainly also discuss the bizarre twists that undoubtedly hurt Clinton on November 8th. They include, but are not limited to, the role of FBI Director James Comey, Russian interference, Anthony Weiner’s sexting scandal, an overblown server scandal and viral rightwing media (I’m looking at you “performance artist” Alex Jones) that spread lies and disinformation about Clinton.                
                

            
                But the reality is that obsessing over what Clinton and her team got wrong distracts from the real issue at hand: the Trump presidency.                
                

            
                Soon President Donald Trump will have been in office for 100 days and with very little to show for it.                
                

            
                He’s failed twice to push through his controversial travel ban, feeling the impact of an independent judiciary, outside groups and security experts. The de facto Muslim ban pulled at the heartstrings of Americans on both sides of the aisle who were horrified when he first floated the idea on the campaign trail - “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on,” his statement said – as there’s little more American than freedom of religion.                
                

            
                The American Health Care Act crashed and burned in spectacular fashion. Majority of the blame rests on Paul Ryan’s shoulders as he let his ego get ahead of good policy, public sentiment and the numbers. What good is a Speaker who can’t deliver his caucus? President Trump learned the hard way that there are actually principled conservatives (shocked this Democrat, too!)                
                

            
                It looks like tax reform is going to have to wait until after health care reform, a dangerous move for Trump as the promise of a big fat tax cut pulled Republicans and Independents who were uneasy about him into his camp. Voters wanted a tax cut even more than the wall at the Southern border.                 
                

            
                And while we’re on the subject, there is no wall.                 
                

            
                Trump promised to drain the swamp and instead filled the White House with bankers from Goldman Sachs and his own family. Can you imagine the outrage if pictures of Chelsea Clinton sitting next to Angela Merkel were making the rounds? Or if Chelsea won a trademark in China after having dinner with President Xi? I can’t even.                
                

            
                ""I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That is what we have the White House for,"" GOP Senator Joni Ernst commented. ""We would love to see more of those State Department visits in Washington D.C. I have not spoken to him about the Florida issue yet, but that is something I think has been bothering not just me, but I think other members of our caucus.” That’s right, the guy who criticized President Obama for nonstop golfing can’t stop golfing – on our dime. His party is noticing.                
                

            
                What’s more, of 554 positions that require Senate confirmation, 473 are still without a nominee and only 22 have been confirmed. That isn’t just Democrat obstruction. That’s Trump.                
                

            
                Then there’s the flip flopping. On NATO, on the Fed, on intervention, on Chinese currency manipulation. And that was just one day!                
                

            
                Against this backdrop, it’s not hard to see why the president’s approval rating continues to hover in the low 40s, even with majority approval for his actions in Syria (Americans split on posturing with North Korea).                
                

            
                Moreover, I’ll spare you a diatribe on rolling back worker and environmental protections – you know what I’m thinking.                
                

            
                In the plus column, the stock market is still performing well and consumer confidence remains high. Elections are won and lost on the economy and that’s where Trump could prove the haters wrong. But without a comprehensive tax plan and the numbers to get it passed – debt hawks are going to be a tough sell especially if Trump deals on infrastructure with Democrats – we’re looking at the potential for a lame duck presidency.                
                

            
                So candidate Trump sold America a bad bill of goods and they bought it. Now we’re getting a bad bill of goods from President Trump. Clinton surely had something to do with that and we’ll continue re-hashing how it all went so wrong until the end of time (or at least the next four years).                
                

            
                But to return to the original point here, I’m a Hillary Clinton fangirl and we should all take note of the message of her concession speech. After taking 8 hours to collect herself, Clinton told her supporters – and all of America – “Last night I congratulated Donald Trump and offered to work with him on behalf of our country. I hope that he will be a successful president for all Americans.”?                
                

            
                I remember her message every time President Trump does something that makes my jaw hit the floor. It’s going to take us all working together. That starts with the occupant of the highest office in the world and trickles down to each and every one of us.                
                

            
                So to all the fangirls out there, we can still love Hillary and make this work. Four years isn’t that long.

When Obama Met Martin Luther King In the Oval Office,"This Sunday President Obama will celebrate the opening of the new Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in Washington, D.C. with a speech to be televised nationally.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                It is a moment rich in history – the first black president dedicating the first national monument to the power of a black minister born at time of racial segregation and who never held high office, led no army to victory and had no wealth.                
                

            
                Dr. King is honored for the power of his words, his Christian appeals for equality in the name of America’s enduring, inspiring capacity to right the wrongs of the past in the name of justice for all.                
                

            
                But before the big day on the mall there was a dream.                
                

            
                President Obama had a dream yesterday.                
                

            
                He saw Dr. King was in the Oval Office. The president was finalizing his speech to celebrate the opening of the King memorial on the National Mall. He looked up from his desk to see a balding old black man, mumbling words from King’s August 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech.                
                

            
                “I still have a dream,” the old man said. The president looked around to see where this man with the familiar voice had come from. Then it hit him and he said “Is that you, Dr. King?”                
                

            
                The nation’s first black President, a very logical, learned and pragmatic man, knew he was dreaming.                
                

            
                But even in the dream he rubbed his eyes in disbelief at the 82-year-old man who looked like a living Dr. King. This Dr. King began speaking louder and louder, reciting words he first spoke at the March on Washington. In lyrical tones he again spoke of his dream of America as a nation rising up to fulfill the Founding Father’s creed of all God’s children being equal... “a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.”                
                

            
                OBAMA: Dr. King? Is that you?                
                

            
                MLK: Mr. President.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Big day for you. Your memorial is between Jefferson and Lincoln.                
                

            
                MLK: And a big day for you, too.                
                

            
                OBAMA: I know. I am trying to get this speech right. It is hard to compete with your words, your dreams for America.                
                

            
                MLK: You are living a dream, my dream, America’s dream, Mr. President. So many of us dreamed of a nation that judges its children and its leaders not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character. You could not have won without white support. You know, son, my spirit was there three years ago today in Denver when you became the first African American to accept the presidential nomination of a major political party. I was never prouder.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Thank you.                
                

            
                MLK: What happened?                
                

            
                OBAMA: What do you mean?                
                

            
                MLK: You spoke about change and hope. Yet, three years in - little has changed and it seems people are losing hope. The American people like you, they love your family, but they are losing the dream.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Change takes time. I am doing the best I can with a bad situation.                
                

            
                MLK: What happened to the “fierce urgency of now?”                
                

            
                Even in his dream President Obama recognized the line from the famous speech. And he did not like it being thrown in his face.
King had said to the 200,000 black, white and Hispanic people there, then largest civil rights march in history at a time of mass jailing and murders of activists involved in intense struggles against racism in small towns and big cities, that there was “no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism …now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice… it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment.”                
                

            
                OBAMA: I don’t need you to lecture me, old man. I know the ‘urgency of now.’ We prevented a second Great Depression and passed health care reform.                
                

            
                MLK: True, that was a good start. But why do you think your political opponents won control of the House while your base of support is sinking and even your support in the liberal community is now colored by disappointment? You extended the Bush tax cuts. You gave up on the public option in the health care bill leaving millions of people uninsured with insurance companies still in control.                
                

            
                OBAMA: I’m a politician. You never ran for any office. You gave great speeches but I am President for everyone. Remember that!                
                

            
                An upset President was standing now, waving his hand and pointing over his desk at the original dreamer, Dr. King.                
                

            
                OBAMA: If I keep my cool and reach out in the spirit of bipartisanship the American people will see who is fighting for them. We have an election coming – the people will decide.                
                

            
                MLK: Really? What about Senator Tom Coburn, whom you once called “not only a dear friend, but also a brother in Christ?” He recently said your “intent is to create dependency” because “as an African-American male, you received tremendous advantage from a lot of these (government) programs.” If that is how your friend talks about you, what must your enemies say?                
                

            
                OBAMA: Tom didn’t really mean that – he must just be trying to fend off a primary challenge from the Tea Party.                
                

            
                MLK: I was up against that violent Birmingham police commissioner Bull Connor with his fire hoses and police dogs. You are up against the non violent opposition of the Tea Party and talk radio. Even most Republicans think the rich should pay more taxes and you still can’t make it happen. We had actual bruises in our struggle you have only a bruised ego.                
                

            
                OBAMA: I will be able to do more in the second term.                
                

            
                MLK: If you get a second term. Lyndon Johnson passed Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, The Economic Opportunity Act – all in his first four years in office. Those were much tougher sells than ending tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires. He did not wait for a second term.                
                

            
                OBAMA: At least we can agree that my presidency has lifted up the black community?                
                

            
                The president shifted from pointing at the living Dr. King to turning his hands up, as if pleading for understanding. He walked over to Dr. King who seemed to be fading, disappearing into the dream.                
                

            
                MLK: The poverty rate is over 15 percent, about 25 percent for blacks and Hispanics. Almost 17% of black people are unemployed. One in nine black men between the ages of 20 and 36 are in prison. Public education in poor neighborhoods is still in shambles. Yes, a black man as President of the United States is a symbol of hope but you need to live up to that symbol with policies that help all the people, especially the children and the poor.                
                

            
                A genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.                
                

            
                OBAMA: Please, Dr. King.                
                

            
                Just then the image of Dr. King faded to a ghost in the Oval Office. But his voice could still be heard. As the President looked around the room, King spoke about America’s heritage of social protest, it capacity for non-violent change, and the enduring promise chiseled in the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence of “Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness,” for all Americans. He spoke about a nation that had sent him to jail for protesting segregation now honoring him with a monument to be opened with words from a black president.                
                

            
                MLK: God bless, America, Mr. President. You are going to have to stand up and let your friends and foes know you, not the politician but the child of Republican Abe Lincoln and Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, a fighter for all the people.                
                

            
                By now the president was turning around and around looking for the living Dr. King. He found himself waking from the dream, tangled in the covers he had pulled off of Michelle. She asked him if he was okay.                
                

            
                The president looked at his wife and said: You know he is more than a monument. Dr.King is alive.

              Even as Congress debates whether to overhaul the nation’s health care system or to wait for ObamaCare to fail, few lawmakers are talking about the hidden health care crisis many Americans with health insurance are already facing: denied coverage.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While much attention has been paid to rising premiums and pre-existing conditions, a growing number of insured Americans with chronic or persistent conditions—up to 53 million—risk being denied coverage for medications, tests and procedures to treat their illness. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              I was recently commissioned to conduct a nationwide poll of insured Americans by the Doctor-Patient Rights Project (DPRP), a new health care advocacy coalition. The results were alarming and disheartening.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            When insurance companies—not doctors—become the arbiters of patient health, no one should be surprised that cost concerns are prioritized. Yet even with losses from ObamaCare mandates, health insurance companies’ net income rose to $13.1 billion in 2016, up 46 percent from the year before.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
              Not only did it find that coverage denials for treatment of chronic conditions were widespread and common, the results suggest that those most in need of quality health care—patients treating serious chronic or persistent diseases—are most frequently denied treatment coverage by their insurers.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Ironically, these denials worsen the conditions for many patients and create an even larger health care expense either for the insurance provider or for the publicly-funded entitlement programs that are intended to serve those the private insurance system leaves behind.  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              While the debate over health care reform has focused largely on increasing the number of people covered by insurance, it has ignored the burden on taxpayers that occurs when insurance providers withhold treatments to consumers who have paid for coverage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              DPRP’s poll found that more than 53 million Americans—nearly one in four with chronic or persistent illnesses—may lack access to essential treatments because their provider denies coverage.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Many of the denied consumers DPRP surveyed were denied multiple times and most had to wait more than a month before their insurer responded to their request for coverage of a prescribed treatment. While they waited, nearly a third said their condition worsened.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              When insurance companies—not doctors—become the arbiters of patient health, no one should be surprised that cost concerns are prioritized. Yet even with losses from ObamaCare mandates, health insurance companies’ net income rose to $13.1 billion in 2016, up 46 percent from the year before.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Health insurers managed to sustain their profits by increasing rates, restricting provider networks and limiting plan benefits.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              One tactic, for example, called “therapeutic substitution” but known more commonly as “non-medical switching” allows insurance companies to direct pharmacists to dispense a cheaper, alternative drug in lieu of the medication the doctor prescribed. In many states, it is perfectly legal for pharmacists to make the switch without notifying the patient or the prescribing doctor beforehand.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Another cost-saving tactic insurers use is step therapies, or “fail first” policies, which require patients with a particular condition to take a less expensive medication and document its ineffectiveness before the insurer will pay for the more expensive drug treatment the doctor has prescribed.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In some cases, patients have waited years and been made to take five or six different drugs before gaining access to the recommended medication.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              As more consumers experience coverage denials, it is unsurprising that they are rejecting—by wide margins—insurance company interference in treatment decisions.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              DPRP’s poll found that 91 percent of consumers believe insurance providers should not have the final say in medical decision-making and should play either a secondary role or no role at all in making treatment decisions, the largest consensus the survey uncovered.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Even if Republicans are successful at repealing ObamaCare’s individual and employer mandates and reducing federal subsidies, it will do little to address the health care concerns of many Americans who have coverage, but have no guarantee it will be there when they need it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              From a simple economic perspective, consumers who are denied the coverage they have purchased, and whose conditions deteriorate as a result, become greater burdens on their health plans or on the taxpayer-funded health care safety net.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Consequently, Congressional efforts to reform the nation’s health care system have little chance of succeeding until legislators address the hidden health care crisis plaguing those who are ostensibly already covered.

                Ask students how long they can stay on their parents’ health insurance because of ObamaCare, and they will likely know the answer is until age 26.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                But how about asking them when the individual mandate goes into effect, how the age rating restriction will impact premium costs, or what perverse incentives ObamaCare creates for employers to cut hours and paychecks?                
                

            
                Too many will be surprised to learn that the individual mandate penalty goes into effect on January 1.

                The ACA mandates that insurers can only charge older people as much as three times the rate charged to younger people, so insurers have less flexibility to charge lower premium costs for younger people.                 
                

            
                Too many young people haven’t yet realized that ObamaCare will shift more costs to them to pay for older, generally less healthy people.                 
                

            
                One study, for example, predicts those between the ages of 21 and 29 will be hit with a 42 percent premium cost increase under ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Similarly, young people aren’t likely to know that ObamaCare requires employers with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time workers to provide coverage or pay a penalty.                 
                

            
                Many businesses struggling in this economy have chosen to cut employees’ hours or keep the number of employees under 50.                 
                

            
                Who often suffers? Young workers and job-seekers.                
                

            
                During a recent speech on campus, I asked the crowd about some of these issues. They were indeed quick to recognize that they could stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26, but they were unaware of the increased costs they would face once they had to buy insurance for themselves.                 
                

            
                This is a problem.                
                

            
                According to research cited in a recent report from the College Republican National Committee, “Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation,” 41 percent of the young people surveyed thought the overall impact of ObamaCare would be positive, and young people preferred how Democrats handled health care by a 63-37 margin. But do they really understand what the Democrats did?                
                

            
                Republicans and other critics of ObamaCare must more effectively make the negative impact of the law known to young people and do so in a compelling way.                
                

            
                This month, the Republican National Committee launched ObamaCareCosts.org, a website dedicated to showing the costs of ObamaCare.                 
                

            
                One video begins with the president touting the positive aspects of his reform effort and ends with a woman challenging his claims by complaining about the costs she faces. The website includes media clips, polls, and an interactive tool that visitors can use to find articles on the negative impact of ObamaCare in their local communities by entering their zip codes.                
                

            
                This puts the effects of this reckless legislation into human terms, and it’s a good demonstration of the real impact the law will have on people. We need more of this.                
                

            
                In 2010, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “But we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it….” It has been over three years since ObamaCare was signed into law, but too many people -- especially young people -- still don’t know what’s really in it.                 
                

            
                The administration knows it is important to win over young people.                 
                

            
                This summer, for example, Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the president, convened a meeting of celebrities to recruit them to sell the ACA, which included actor Kal Penn (a former Obama administration official), comedian Amy Poehler, Funny or Die’s Mike Farah and YouTube’s Daniel Kellison, among others.                
                

            
                If critics of ObamaCare want to undo the damage of this legislation and pursue health care reform, they must make an even greater effort to make the true costs and consequences of ObamaCare apparent to young people.                 
                

            
                Young people must know more about ObamaCare than “Age 26.”

                A desperate President Obama went to Capitol Hill Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to try and save his disastrous health care law, but all he managed to do was get left-wing lawmakers to back the monumental failure with old, tired and divisive rhetoric.

                They want to scare the American people because Republicans want to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But all they can offer are lame talking points.                
                

            
                “The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn't make America great again, it would make America sick again,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

                But while Democrats were pointing fingers and spouting canned lines, Vice President-elect Mike Pence was meeting with Republicans to formulate a real plan to repeal and replace the disastrous law.                
                

            
                “The first order of business is to repeal and replace ObamaCare,” Pence reasoned. “ObamaCare has failed. And the American people have sent a decisive message to Washington, D.C., that they want ObamaCare to be repealed and replaced with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government.”                
                

            
                Republicans need to make sure they keep their promises and move quickly to repeal and replace ObamaCare. But they also need to be careful, because Democrats have already shown they are not going to blame themselves when ObamaCare finally dies and crumbles.                
                

            
                President-elect Trump warned the GOP in a tweet that, ""Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases, like the 116 percent hike in Arizona Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web.""                
                

            
                Trump is 100 percent right. Republicans need to make President Obama and the Democrats own every lie they told, every failed promise they didn't keep. And there were a bunch of them.                
                

            
                “No matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period,” Obama said on June 15, 2009. “If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan, period.”                
                

            
                Two months later, he said, “If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.”                
                

            
                Obama promised that the average family would save $2,500 per year. Well, since 2009, the average American family is paying $4,100 more for health care.                
                

            
                We also know that millions of Americans lost their doctors and their plans or both. And that is just the start of this ObamaCare disaster.                
                

            
                Here's what the president and Democrats own, because remember, not a single Republican voted for this law: ObamaCare premiums this year along are increasing by 25 percent on average. Premiums on average for a family of four making $60,000 a year will spike by 43.6 percent. Deductibles for the same group are exploding by 22.9 percent.                
                

            
                The misery doesn't end there. The president promised free-market competition and choices for Americans on the exchanges, but the opposite has happened. Major insurers like Humana, Aetna, United Healthcare and Blue Cross Blue Shield are all pulling out of states because they are losing money on the exchanges. Humana alone lost over $1 billion just for participating in ObamaCare. In states like Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wyoming, people have only one insurer to choose from now.                
                

            
                And then there's all the taxes. The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has previously found that the middle class will face $377 billion in tax increases, courtesy of ObamaCare. According to a recent study, the surging ObamaCare premiums will cost American taxpayers an extra $9.8 billion this year alone.                
                

            
                The negative impact of ObamaCare is obvious, and it helped propel President-elect Trump to victory. Sure, there are certain aspects of the law that Republicans will keep, like coverage for people with pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents’ plan until age 26. But ObamaCare itself is a single, fundamental, massive big government failure that needs to be completely scrapped and redone. American consumers deserve better care, free-market competition and lower costs.

Now They're Blaming Bush for Obama's Campaign Strategy,"Over the weekend, a pair of political pundits – National Journal’s Charlie Cook and the New York Times’ John Harwood -- engaged in some historical revisionism, suggesting President Obama’s emerging campaign strategy was (more or less) a carbon copy of President George W. Bush’s 2004 re-election bid.

Like a lot of revisionist history, there was a surface appeal to their theories. But alas, neither writer got it right. Mr. Bush is not to blame for Mr. Obama’s dash to the far left wing of his party. Mr. Obama is.

Let’s begin with the noted prognosticator and electoral commentator extraordinaire Charlie Cook, who suggested that when “independent voters…viewed Bush with skepticism,” the 2004 reelection “began focusing more on expanding its base than on throwing huge amounts of resources at independent and undecided voters.” Mr. Obama, he opined, is merely doing this year what Mr. Bush did eight years ago.

Uh, no.

If Mr. Bush won re-election by focusing on the Republican Party’s base, exactly how is it that he won 23% more votes than he received in 2000?                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                By focusing on the GOP base, did Mr. Bush (a) nearly erase the gender gap; (b) carry the highest percentage of Hispanic voters for a Republican since exit polls began tracking Latinos; (c) increase his share of the African-American vote by 22%; (d) boost his support among union households by 4 points; and (e) do better among Jewish voters than any Republican since Ronald Reagan swept 49 states in 1984?

Mr. Cook asserts all those gains occurred because the Bush campaign focused on its base rather than throw “huge amounts of resources” at swing voters. That’s news to me.

Mr. Cook described only one leg of the Bush tactical approach. Of course we took steps to energize the Republican base; any incumbent does. But the 2004 Bush re-election also focused a huge amount of attention on persuading independents and swiping “soft” Democrats. The former succeeded so well that Mr. Bush won 48% among independents and 11% of Democrats while Mr. Kerry carried 49% of independents and only 6% of Republicans.

Much of the Bush re-election’s massive volunteer effort was aimed at persuading non-Republicans to support Bush. So was its advertising, including an extensive under-the-radar effort on African-American radio stations that helped, for example, double Mr. Bush’s support among Black voters in Ohio.

Mr. Cook concedes that a “base-only” strategy has its weaknesses and risks, requiring a candidate to place all his political eggs in one political basket. That’s why Mr. Bush’s re-election would have rejected a “base-only” strategy in a nanosecond as politically insane.

Last weekend’s other revisionist journalist is the New York Times’ John Harwood. He, too, suggested Mr. Obama is parroting Mr. Bush’s 2004 strategy, writing that in 2004, “George W. Bush exploited social and national security issues to offset his economic vulnerabilities.”

But what “economic vulnerabilities” does Mr. Harwood have in mind? The average unemployment rate in 2003 was 6% and for 2004, 5.5% (compared to 9.1% today). According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the economy grew 4.7% in 2003 and 6.4% in 2004.                 
                

            
                In the last two quarters, by comparison, the economy has grown at 0.4 percent and 1.3 percent. The 2004 election, in fact, took place in the midst of an unprecedented period of uninterrupted job growth. Mr. Obama is stressing social issues because he wants to downplay the economic ones.

In addition, it wasn’t Mr. Bush who injected social issues – namely gay marriage – into the 2004 campaign. It was instead the Massachusetts Superior Judicial Court with its November 2003 decision legalizing gay marriage in the Bay State. That is what altered the status quo and forced conservatives to react.                 
                

            
                The Massachusetts decision set off a grass roots reaction throughout the country that eventually led 11 states to pass traditional marriage measures by referendum in November 2004.                 
                

            
                It’s also worth noting that the then-president and his 2004 Democratic opponent both supported the traditional definition of marriage, as did Mr. Obama in his 2008 contest.

Third, Mr. Bush had little choice in making national security the focal point of his 2004 campaign. The Democratic opposition already had made it so: it was the number one issue in the 2003 lead-up to their primaries, propelling the little known governor of Vermont to frontrunner status (until his campaign imploded in Iowa).

To suggest Mr. Bush focused on Iraq and the War on Terror to compensate for the economy is laughable. With unemployment low and GDP growth robust, Democrats didn’t want to make the election about the economy. The war was an issue because the Democrats wanted to fight the campaign over it. And Mr. Bush was happy to oblige. We knew he could defeat Senator Kerry on multiple political fronts.

Mr. Harwood did hit the mark on an important aspect of Mr. Obama’s current strategy: the president has suffered an enormous decline among college graduates, independents and young people (his job approval rating among the last group has dropped 30 points since his inaugural).                 
                

            
                But President Obama is pursuing a strategy that is completely at odds with, not similar to, the one pursued by President Bush. And these appeals to class warfare, demands for higher taxes, and slashing attacks on his political opponents are unlikely to get these voters back, no matter where Mr. Obama stands on social issues. These groups were among those most powerfully drawn to the young Illinois senator’s pledge to change Washington by being the president “not of red states or blue states but the United States.”

The latest Obama strategy, though, is to seek to divide Americans in every possible way, including by class and sexual orientation. And so Mr. Obama takes great delight in excoriating “millionaires and billionaires” for their “corporate jets.”                 
                

            
                This weekend he attacked Republicans for not denouncing a couple of people sitting in a debate audience who booed a question on repealing ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" (they did not boo the gay soldier). This is a pitiful (and fruitless) effort to draw attention away from the disastrous effects of his stimulus program, alarm over his spending patterns and deficits, and the huge opposition to his signature achievement, health care reform.

To date Mr. Obama’s re-election strategy is, if anything, an anti-Bush strategy. If an unpaid intern had suggested we do what the Obama campaign is doing, he’d have been demoted. But thankfully no one on the ’04 Bush campaign was that stupid.

Challenges and joys facing America's small businesses,"A new small business starts with an idea, but in between that first dream and the first sale there are lots of obstacles. Still, millions of Americans open their own business every year. This creativity and persistence of small business owners fuels our economy.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                According to the Census Bureau, 99.7 percent of U.S. businesses are small employers and these small businesses employ about half of all private sector employees. Small businesses are responsible for more than 60 percent of net new jobs in the last two decades.                
                

            
                Yet in recent years small employers have faced a host of new hurdles to overcome before they can open their doors or make their website go live. They add up quickly, blocking attempts to start up or forcing some longtime owners to close their doors.  Among the hardest for small businesses to clear are federal regulations, federal taxes and the rising cost of health insurance.                
                

            
                No one goes into business because they like filling out government paperwork, yet Washington has been engaged in a great effort to pile up new regulations. In fact there are currently thousands of proposed rules awaiting approval and many will affect small business directly.                 
                

            
                One such proposal would drastically expand the Clean Water Act, for the first time giving the federal government jurisdiction over private ponds, seasonal streams, usually dry creek beds and other bodies of water.  If the White House approves the rule, farmers and local business owners will have to apply to the EPA to do anything on their own land that might affect a nearby water source.  It’ll add tens of thousands of dollars to small projects and lead invariably to potentially devastating lawsuits brought by activists.                
                

            
                The complexity of the tax code, which now exceeds 70,000 pages, is another major barrier to growth. NFIB research calculates that tax paperwork costs small businesses $74 an hour. That’s 67 percent higher than what the average cost of compliance is for big businesses.  And according to the IRS the typical small business now devotes 24 hours per year just on tax preparation.                  
                

            
                Of course, high tax rates inhibit growth, too, by siphoning away money that small businesses would otherwise invest.  President Obama and some members of Congress have proposed a cut in the corporate income tax rate.  But that would exclude three quarters of small businesses who file as individuals.  Those small businesses, many of which pay the top rate of 39.6 percent, create more jobs than corporations and they pay a larger share of federal taxes.  Cutting small business income tax rates would free up capital, stimulate demand and strongly encourage job creation.  It would also simplify the process for small business owners and give them time to focus on growth.                
                

            
                Among the barriers for small business perhaps the most worrisome is the spiraling cost of health care.  In the last decade, average health insurance premiums for small firms have increased 63 percent.  Small business owners hoped that health care reform would reduce the cost of insurance.  Instead, Obamacare made it more expensive.  Sixty-two percent of small businesses we surveyed claimed that per employee premium costs were higher in mid-2014 than in mid-2013. Statistics for the previous year were similar too. In 2014, only 40 percent of small employers offer employer-sponsored health insurance, down six points from the previous year.                
                

            
                Obamacare created 21 new taxes, new mandatory coverages and new red tape that has reduced the choices available to small business owners. One of the worst of these new taxes is the Health Insurance Tax. This tax falls on the fully insured market, where 88 percent of small businesses purchase their coverage. While the tax is on the insurers, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has stated that this increase will get passed on to customers in the form of higher premiums. Our own research shows that private sector employment could by more than 262,000 jobs in the next seven years. Nearly two-thirds of these losses would be at small businesses.                
                

            
                Despite all these obstacles, there is still much to celebrate during Small Business Week. Millions of small business owners are working hard to provide for themselves and their families. They are contributing to their communities by doing things like sponsoring sports leagues, keeping their neighborhood clean, and so much more. There is incredible fulfillment in watching something that you started grow and thrive. As long as this country lets individuals profit from their creativity and industry, there will be people who sacrifice to make their dreams come true. We are all better off because of them.

Supreme Court upholds ObamaCare and Americans have lost the right to be left alone,"Editor's note: The National Federation of Independent Business joined with 26 states in the lawsuit against the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The author of this commentary, Karen Harned is the executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business Small Business Legal Center.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                When President Obama signed the Patients Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly known as ""ObamaCare"" into law in 2010, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) decided that we had to take the fight to the Courts.                  
                

            
                We joined the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the health care law because, for months, we had heard from small business owners who were greatly concerned over the costs, the burdens and the impositions that the PPACA would bring. They believed it threatened their businesses, employees, families, and livelihoods.                 
                

            
                So we fought to the bitter end to keep their fears from playing out.                  
                

            
                Yet this case was about something bigger than health care policy, it was about preserving American liberty from the increasingly powerful hand of the federal government.                  
                

            
                Today marks a sad day in the history of America. With this decision, Americans have lost the right to be left alone, which Justice William O. Douglas once called “the beginning of all freedom.”                 
                

            
                It is painful to recognize that the liberties which our forefathers fought a revolution to secure have been lost. But it is clear that our original constitutional system has been thrown out, and we are left with only the democratic process to preserve our rights. That should be a sobering thought for anyone who values liberty.                
                

            
                The significance of this decision cannot be overstated. Our Founding Fathers were greatly concerned that by giving too much power to the federal government, they would be endangering our liberties. So they sought to restrain the federal government by vesting it with only limited powers. As James Madison said, the powers of the federal government were to be “few and defined.” Yet with this decision, it is clear that the powers of the federal government are no longer limited at all. Our only remaining protections are with those liberties which were explicitly spelled out in the Bill of Rights, and even those are under assault. So today Madison’s vision of the American Republic has been turned on its head: The powers of the federal government are now broad and uncabined, and the freedoms of the people are few and confined.                
                

            
                As Justice Kennedy put it, during oral arguments in March, the individual mandate “changes the relationship of the Federal Government to the individual in a very fundamental way.” We wholeheartedly wish that more weight had been added to that statement in the Court’s opinion. But the die has been cast.                 
                

            
                We must now look forward, with great trepidation, into this brave new world, a world in which the Constitution has been undone, and federal power knows no limit. This is a day that our Founders would never have wanted to see. All that they had fought to secure and preserve has been lost.                
                

            
                But, it is important to realize that at the end of the day this is about real people. We were fighting so that small business owners would not be subject to paternalistic demands to buy a product that they did not want, or need.                 
                

            
                We were fighting so that you and I could choose whether or not to buy broccoli, or cars or gym memberships or solar panels. With this decision, we no longer have the choice.                
                

            
                What will happen next is anyone’s guess. But it seems clear that the political dialogue over health care reforms will continue.                 
                

            
                In any event, we will never give up, and we will never give in. Today we have suffered a terrible setback, but we will press on in our fight to protect small business owners, and to restore our lost Constitution.                
                

            
                On the health care front, the mandates and burdens imposed by the PPACA remain a grave concern for small businesses. Moreover, small business owners are still worried about the costs of health care; so health care reform will remain a top priority for NFIB.                 
                

            
                We have long advocated free-market oriented health care solutions that will benefit all Americans without putting undue strain on our job creators, and we will continue to carry that banner forward until we have achieved workable solutions to these vexing problems.

"Hey, GOP Candidates -- Bring Your 'A' Game to the Iowa Debate or Stay Home","Like many Americans across the country, I will be watching Thursday’s Iowa presidential debates with keen interest.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Watch the GOP debate on Fox News Channel at 9 p.m. ET or watch it streaming live on FoxNews.com from 8:30 p.m. ET.                
                

            
                There is no doubt this debate will make or break the campaigns of one or two candidates. So, if the candidates have been holding anything back, now is the time to bring it. The Iowa Caucuses are only 20 days away, followed shortly by New Hampshire.                
                

            
                As the newest frontrunner, Newt Gingrich is facing criticism for blemishes on his very long political record. His opponents will seek to exploit his past support for an individual health care mandate, bailouts, and climate change. And to be fair, Americans deserve to know how Gingrich has changed, not only on these policy issues, but on past personal and moral choices.                
                

            
                It’s no secret Gingrich is receiving disapproval, especially from evangelical Christians, for his three marriages. But as Christians, we desperately desire forgiveness and grace, and we believe it exists for all who ask for it from God, even our leaders.                 
                

            
                The real angst centers on the question of true repentance, which is essential for change but, alas, only God sees our hearts. And we have to give Gingrich credit for going above and beyond this week to confront his past personal and public woes.                
                

            
                I was impressed when last week Gingrich drafted his own marriage pledge, which committed his loyalty to his wife, conservative values, the Constitution, and the American people, in response to the Family Leaders’ “Marriage Vow.” -- Yes, we want it in writing.                
                

            
                Besides moral character, America’s current economic crisis is, and will continue to be, the greatest factor in the 2012 election.                
                

            
                Mitt Romney has the best professional background in business and has been a steady candidate throughout the race, although Gingrich and Perry cleaned his clock in last week’s debate. But despite his experience, Romney’s big-government views will likely frustrate voters who are tired of the country’s huge unemployment rates and a mounting $15 trillion national debt. Further, it will be hard for the former Massachusetts governor to explain why his state health care reform cost the state $4.3 billion, sacrificed over 18,000 jobs, and did not include protection for the unborn. Yes, we know Romney blames the state courts, but in the end, he signed the law.                
                

            
                Rick Perry did much better in the last debate and, by now, the campaign has acknowledged that he had serious back surgery that many believe severely impacted his performance early in his campaign. His exceptional record as governor of Texas, and his dedication to his evangelical faith, gains him support from Iowa Christian conservatives, but is it enough? Perry’s super PAC, Make Us Great Again, has spent over $2 million on campaign ads in Iowa alone. As a result, his poll numbers may be improving.                 
                

            
                This debate may truly make or break him. If he does well, he may have a chance to resurge; if not, he should probably pack it up and think about future career opportunities.                
                

            
                Michele Bachmann did a great job in the last debate explaining more of her personal background and how it shapes her strong Constitutional principles. I had no idea her father deserted her and left her  Godly, single mother to raise the family.                 
                

            
                It is also essential for Michele to hit a home run this time around, but if it is anything like last week, she is up to the task. The congresswoman used her consistent conservative record to decimate Newt and Romney, and she will be a fierce threat to them again on Thursday.                
                

            
                And why on earth has Rick Santorum’s passionate social and fiscal platforms not gained more support? He is the real deal. A father of seven, including a daughter named Bella who was born with Trisomy 18, a seriously disabling and usually fatal disorder, he’s got an amazing record in the Senate for carrying the pro-life and pro-family torch. It makes no sense why he has had to fight for even a shred of media attention. My advice to Santorum: master the art of knee-capping your opponents while smiling like you just offered them a cookie.                
                

            
                Ron Paul has done a great job of changing the debate over the Federal Reserve’s heavy hand in citizen’s lives, but he isn’t serious when it comes to foreign policy. Does he really not believe that Iran is a threat to national security? And where does he stand in support of Israel if, God forbid, Iran makes an attack?                
                

            
                Is Jon Huntsman in this debate? I honestly believe he made a mistake and meant to sign up for the next Democratic presidential race. Based on his social and fiscal policies, I can’t see him as the next GOP nominee. (Although, I do see him selling me my next used car when this race is over.)                
                

            
                Yes I know, ANOTHER debate. How many does this make? Fifty? Regardless, folks, this is the one to watch. Don the jammies, grab the popcorn, and figure out who should lead the free world.

"BERNARD GOLDBERG: Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the Race Card and President Smith","Let’s count the number of people who think Donald Trump is a racist. On second thought, let’s not. We’ll be here all day. But a short list includes Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, David Letterman, Bob Schieffer, some guy named Ed Schultz who screams a lot on MSNBC, and Chris Mathews who says Trump is appealing to “right-wing rubes” who “just don’t like him [Obama] because he’s black.”                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Even Seth Meyers, the ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian who hosted the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday night, took a jab at The Donald, who was in the audience. ""Trump said recently that he has a great relationship with the blacks,"" Meyers told the crowd.                
                

            
                ""But unless the Blacks are a family of white people, I'll bet he's mistaken.""                
                

            
                Yes, they’re all liberals and liberals tend to see racism all over the place. It’s one of the things that make them feel morally superior to everyone who doesn’t see racism all over the place. It’s one of the ways liberals tell black people, “We’re the good white people. So please don’t blame us for the past.”                
                

            
                The ammo Trump handed his critics started with his fascination with Barack Obama’s birth certificate. At the Correspondents' dinner, Mr. Obama, comedian-in-chief for the evening, returned the fire. ""Donald Trump is here tonight,"" the president said. ""Now I know that he's taken some flak lately, but no one is prouder to put this birth certifcate to rest than The Donald. Now he can get to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing.""                
                

            
                Big laughs from the journalists and their guests.                
                

            
                But some others who had The Donald in their cross-hairs weren't laughing -- not after Trump said that Mr. Obama should get “off his basketball court or whatever he is doing at the time” and pressure OPEC to lower gas prices. And not when he wondered out loud whether Barack Obama got crummy grades at Columbia and still managed, somehow, to get into Harvard Law. Can you say affirmative action?                
                

            
                On ""The View,"" Joy Behar said, “It’s very racist. He can’t fathom that a black man could be that smart. That’s what’s behind this.”                
                

            
                Whoopi Goldberg said, “I’m getting tired of trying to find reasons not to think of stuff as being racist. Being black, when you say, ‘You know, this is racist,’ 9,000 people say, ‘Oh, no, you’re just playing the race card!’ Well, you know what? I’m playing the damn card now!”                
                

            
                Bob Schieffer of CBS News said, “That’s just code for saying he got into law school because he’s black. This is an ugly strain of racism that’s running through this whole thing.”                
                

            
                David Letterman said, “It’s all fun, it’s all a circus, it’s all a rodeo, until it starts to smack of racism. And then it’s no longer fun.”                
                

            
                Ed Shultz kept it short and sweet: “I think Donald Trump is a racist.”                
                

            
                Let’s see if I have this right: It’s racist if Donald Trump questions Barack Obama’s academic credentials, if he wonders what kind of grades he got in college — but it was perfectly okay for liberals to make fun of President Bush because of his so-so grades at Yale. Really?                
                

            
                Of course it’s not just what Donald Trump said about Mr. Obama’s grades. The fact is if you say just about anything negative about President Obama there’s a good chance you’re going to be called a racist. Against his stimulus bill? You’re probably a racist. Against ObamaCare. Yup, you’re a racist. And it started even before he was elected.                
                

            
                Back in 2008, when Mr. Obama was running for president, Jacob Weisberg wrote a piece for Slate, the online magazine, which ran under this headline: If Obama Loses Racism is the only reason McCain might beat him                
                

            
                Are there some racists out there who hate Barack Obama simply because he’s black. Sadly, yes. Are the birthers, especially the ones who still don’t believe Barack Obama was born in the United States, unbearably stupid. Yes again.                 
                

            
                In a country of more than 300 million people, there are going to be some stupid bigots in the crowd. But the haters don’t begin to represent all, or most, or even a significant percentage of the president’s critics. The nuts and the haters play at the fringe.                
                

            
                And whatever one may think of Donald Trump, he is no racist. His many New York liberal friends would have spotted it years ago if he was, and would have dropped him like the proverbial bad habit.                
                

            
                Yet, even smart liberals apparently can’t fathom that it might be Mr.Obama’s liberal policies that Donald Trump and the vast majority of conservatives don’t like, not the color of his skin. So let’s make it easy for my liberal friends. Let’s play pretend.                
                

            
                Let’s pretend that two years ago voters elected America’s first black president. Except this one is a Republican and as conservative as Rush Limbaugh. Let’s call him President Smith.                
                

            
                President Smith is against raising taxes on the wealthy. He’s against massive health care reform that forces everyone who can afford it to buy an insurance policy. He’s against going on a world tour apologizing for America’s supposed sins. He’s for lowering taxes on individuals and businesses. He’s for cutting federal spending to get control of both the short term deficit and the long term national debt. He thinks citizens should have the right to own a gun and he’s against any federal money going to pay for abortions – or NPR.                
                

            
                Okay, here’s the question: Are we supposed to think that Donald Trump or any other critic of President Obama would condemn our pretend President Smith because he’s an African-American? I don’t think so. Not even if he had a Muslim-sounding first and middle name. Not even if his father was born in Kenya. Not even if he had questionable grades way back in college and liked to play basketball. My guess is the overwhelming percentage of conservatives would be thrilled that they finally, at long last, had a true-blue conservative back in the White House and couldn’t care less if he was black.                
                

            
                And who would be criticizing our make-believe President Smith for his hard right positions. Not Donald Trump. Liberals would, that’s who.                
                

            
                Does that make them racists? After all, Mr. Smith is black?

                For us it is clear that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is an important step in improving the lives of all Americans and especially for Hispanics. Implementation of the ACA will make it possible for many people to obtain health insurance who up to now had no options for purchasing health insurance.                 
                

            
                For Hispanics, obtaining affordable health insurance is particularly critical as we are the community least likely to have health insurance. The lack of health insurance among Hispanics is usually driven by two factors. First, Hispanics are more likely to work in places that do not provide health insurance for their employees. Additionally, Hispanics are likely to be independent contractors or cobble together several part-time jobs in order to provide income for their families.                 
                

            
                In both of these cases options for purchasing health insurance are very limited.                 
                

            
                Second, because in some states like Texas a modest income disqualifies a person from any public health insurance.                
                

            
                The Affordable Care Act makes it possible for persons to buy health insurance. This is even possible when the person has a pre-existing condition, like diabetes, that prevented many Hispanics from obtaining coverage in the past even when their employer offered it. The coverage that was out of reach is now affordable and for those with very modest incomes there is some support from the government to help pay for premiums.                 
                

            
                Will there be glitches as this program unfolds? Of course. Perfection on rollout of a new program is never expected, especially for something as huge as health care where success will be driven by addressing the circumstance of the individual. What is expected are improvements as we move along the way and work to improve coverage for those who have gone without it for so long.                
                

            
                Is the ACA the answer to all of our health issues? Of course not, but it is a way to provide health insurance for those who up to now could not obtain it. It is a critical first step for the long road ahead that we must travel to fully achieve the health care reform that we all want and need. We have to work together to get there because this is a matter of life and death.

                The Republican congressional leadership erred because they decided to repeal and replace ObamaCare within the traditions of the pre-Trump legislative swamp.                
                

            
                By default, they accepted the fake scores of the Congressional Budget Office. By allowing the scores to exist, they let Democrats and the media quote ""the non-partisan CBO"" to their disadvantage.                
                

            
                Leadership applied the absurd limitations of Senate reconciliation rules to a House bill, even though it was guaranteed to frustrate their conservative members.                
                

            
                They established a deadline for failure – which we know is detrimental to large legislative achievements. Ronald Reagan took eight months to pass a tax cut, which was giving away money. We took 18 months to pass welfare reform, which had the support of 92 percent of Americans. Obama took eight months to pass ObamaCare – even while he promised it would cure all our health care ills.                
                

            
                The current congressional leadership tried to pass a complicated, critical bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare in fewer than three months.                
                

            
                While Republicans focused on process, and a complex, wonky, Washington-insider argument (just read the transcripts), their opponents in the media and the left hammered away at the human cost of their bill. The result: By the time the bill was pulled, only 17 percent of Americans – or less than 1 in 5 – wanted it.                
                

            
                In an era when total outsider candidate Donald J. Trump was elected president, congressional leaders adopted a “trust us, we’re in Washington” strategy. They promised all the rough edges would be smoothed over during Stages 2 and 3 – which were obscure and undefined. Americans didn’t believe them.                
                

            
                Frankly, they were fortunate to avoid the vote. Insider health reform was a major factor in killing the Democratic House majority in 1994 – after a 40-year reign. Insider health reform killed the House Democratic majority in 2010, too. Voting for a bill with 17 percent approval might have broken the current House majority.                
                

            
                History has taught us: America doesn’t like political health care. There is a deep imperative for Congress to think through bipartisan health care reform.                
                

            
                The House and Senate GOP leadership can learn a lot of lessons from this failed experiment – if they are willing to.                
                

            
                THE ROAD AHEAD                
                

            
                There are a set of principles for successful conservative reforms. President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher used them in the 1980s. We followed them in creating the ""Contract with America"" in 1994, reforming welfare in 1996 and passing the balanced budget in 1997.                
                

            
                As Thatcher said: ""First you win the argument, then you win the vote."" The best short book on her fight to reform Britain, Claire Berlinski's ""There is no Alternative: Why Margaret Thatcher Matters,"" makes clear the moral, human arguments Thatcher used to dismantle socialism in Britain.                
                

            
                The No. 1 goal of any health reform must be to communicate with the American people and convince them this will provide a much better future than the current system. Tom Evans' ""The Education of Ronald Reagan"" outlines Reagan’s years at General Electric and the lessons he learned in focusing on educating the public, so they would educate the Congress.                
                

            
                In Reagan's farewell address, he explained his legislative successes this way: ""I've had my share of victories in the Congress, but what few people noticed is that I never won anything you didn't win for me. They never saw my troops, they never saw Reagan's regiments, the American people. You won every battle with every call you made and letter you wrote demanding action.""                
                

            
                A new health reform effort must start by focusing on the American people and winning their support. It will be President Trump's health rallies in the states which win the day not clever insider negotiating in Washington.                
                

            
                2.  The key is to focus on health and health care, not on financing.                
                

            
                When asked about his success, Eisenhower said, “Whenever I run into a problem I can’t solve, I always make it bigger. I can never solve it by trying to make it smaller, but if I make it big enough, I can begin to see the outlines of a solution.”                
                

            
                That principle applies to reforming the health system. To solve health financing, you have to expand the discussion to the entire health system.                
                

            
                For decades, government has tried to focus on financing. Costs continue to rise. Systems get more and more complex. A bigger and bigger percentage of money is spent on bureaucracy (public and private) rather than health. People get lost in the arguments about insurance and programs, because they are highly technical and don't relate directly to their lives.                
                

            
                The first goal must be to describe the values (and the systems which will achieve those values) that matter to people.                
                

            
                People want to live longer and healthier, at lower cost, and with greater convenience. For example, people want solutions other than nursing homes. They want systems other than maintenance for diseases. They want health and independent living. There are many.                
                

            
                Health policies have to be described in both micro and macro terms.                
                

            
                Micro policies are quite simply ""what does it mean to me and my family?"" People at the personal level want to know about their own health, their access to health care, their premiums, their deductibles and whether they have access to the doctors they want.                
                

            
                Macro policies are how the society, the private sector, nonprofits and government are going to organize and incentivize activities to achieve the micro policies.                
                

            
                3. Health is the largest sector of the American economy and the most complex. Health care is at least 10 times more complicated than national security. It is one-fifth of our economy.                
                

            
                Really understanding and solving health and health care takes more time than politicians and bureaucrats have been willing to invest.                
                

            
                Hearings must be held geographically, by topic, and by specific specialties to gather enough information to develop a series of steps that will improve health and health care.                
                

            
                Listen-Learn-Help-Lead is the key system for involving the entire country and developing a comprehensive understanding of what the American people want and how to achieve it.                
                

            
                Health is broader than payments. The National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Food and Drug Administration, federal community health centers, the Indian Health Service, the Veterans Administration, Tricare, etc. are all part of the fabric of meeting our health potential.                
                

            
                4. As the health reform plan evolves, it has to be described in very detailed question-and-answer systems online, so people can understand how it affects them, health professionals can understand how they will be impacted, the news media can understand it, and the elected officials can explain and defend it.                
                

            
                The plan should meet the goals defined by President Trump during the campaign. They were the goals the American people voted for and, unlike Obama, we should keep our word.                
                

            
                The plan should be implemented in a series of bills. It is impossible to write a comprehensive health care bill. No one can understand the complexity. No one can understand all the second- and third-order effects. The 21st Century Cures bill, as a bipartisan achievement, is a better model than the HillaryCare and ObamaCare comprehensive bills.                
                

            
                5. It should be possible to outline the entire new system in a series of very clear charts, so everyone can understand the goals and the directions before being asked to support the transition process. People both have to understand the long-term values-based goals and the policy changes, which will be bridges to achieve these goals.                
                

            
                6. Properly developed, a dynamic, innovative, science-based American health system will be the largest job creator, the largest sector of high-paying jobs, and the biggest earner of foreign exchange in the country. If we liberate the American health system so it can once again be the most innovative and effective in the world, people all over the planet will buy American health products, seek American health technology, and ask to see American medical specialists. Health is not a problem, it is a great opportunity and should be approached as such.                
                

            
                7. Following a disciplined road map like this is hard work and requires more patience and more discipline than the inside Washington game. As Reagan, Thatcher, and the “Contract with America” Congress proved, it can also yield dramatically bigger and better results.

              As the end of President Trump’s first year in office nears, Republicans are desperate for a victory. Following their failure to pass health care reform, polling shows they trail Democrats by nine percentage points in a generic 2018 House race. The GOP has one last hope to save its first year agenda: passing middle class and small business tax cuts.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Recent Gallup polling shows “significant” middle class tax cuts are supported by a sizable majority of Americans. For good reason. Too many hardworking taxpayers struggle to make ends meet. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Despite modest recent improvement, median wages have stagnated for most of this century. New survey data shows that four out of five full time employees are living paycheck-to-paycheck. 
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              A recent Federal Reserve report finds that nearly half of Americans could not cover an unexpected $400 expense like a car repair or home appliance replacement. Meanwhile, health care, housing, and child care costs have skyrocketed. A tax cut is the most direct way to boost wages and provide these families some relief.  
 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A tax cut for American small businesses, over which the economic recovery has largely passed, would do just as much good. It would allow small businesses to keep more of their earnings, reversing their decades-long decline and reinvigorating Main Streets in communities across the country. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Consider the results of a recent Job Creators Network nationwide poll of small business owners: Most respondents said they would reinvest their tax cut savings in the form of employee wage hikes, new hires, and expansion.  
  
 This suggests a tax cut could address the problem of stagnating wages twice. First, by directly giving all hardworking taxpayers an immediate raise in their take home pay. Second, by allowing small business employers the funds to provide a pay raise.  
  
 Whether your politics are left, right, or center, this is something we can all agree on: More money in more Americans’ pockets is a good thing for everyone.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              More money in our communities and less shipped off to Washington D.C. would produce a major economic stimulus, helping the country get back to its historic economic growth rate above three percent. This economic growth would help offset the fiscal costs of a tax cut. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Americans have shouldered the costs of out-of-control Capitol Hill spending for too long.?But rather than cut costs, Washington keeps hitting withdraw, withdraw, withdraw. The government treats taxpayer wages like a Take-a-Penny tray. ?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In order to highlight the substantial benefits of a tax cut for American small businesses, families, and communities, my organization, Job Creators Network, is launching a major tax cut campaign, which includes a nationwide bus tour with a rally stop at the IRS building in Washington D.C. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The message is simple: Pass a tax cut retroactive to January 1st and give working and middle class Americans a bigger paycheck by returning some of the money the government took from them last year – hundreds of dollars a month – to their wallets today. ? 
 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Think of what a family of four could do with a few hundred extra dollars: cover unexpected expenses, keep up with out-of-control health care costs, buffer savings accounts, or even take a well-deserved vacation. And think of what a small business could do: raise wages for loyal employees, hire some weekend help, expand into new product lines, or give back to the community.?It’s their money. They earned it. They should have the final say on how to spend it.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s time for Congress to come together and deliver results that actually matter at the dinner table. To recognize what hardworking taxpayers plainly need and deserve. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              We’re not asking for a sweeping overhaul of the federal tax code. We’re not asking for a once-in-a-generation, bipartisan omnibus reform package. We’re asking for a simple, one-time tax cut that puts a few extra dollars back in people’s pockets in time for the holidays. By next year, it will be too late

What Occupy Wall Street Protesters Really Believe,"President Obama and the Democratic leadership are making a critical error in embracing the Occupy Wall Street movement—and it may cost them the 2012 election.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Last week, senior White House adviser David Plouffe said that ""the protests you're seeing are the same conversations people are having in living rooms and kitchens all across America. . . . People are frustrated by an economy that does not reward hard work and responsibility, where Wall Street and Main Street don't seem to play by the same set of rules."" Nancy Pelosi and others have echoed the message.                
                

            
                Yet the Occupy Wall Street movement reflects values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American people—and particularly with swing voters who are largely independent and have been trending away from the president since the debate over health-care reform.                
                

            
                The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies. On Oct. 10 and 11, Arielle Alter Confino, a senior researcher at my polling firm, interviewed nearly 200 protesters in New York's Zuccotti Park. Our findings probably represent the first systematic random sample of Occupy Wall Street opinion.                
                

            
                Our research shows clearly that the movement doesn't represent unemployed America and is not ideologically diverse. Rather, it comprises an unrepresentative segment of the electorate that believes in radical redistribution of wealth, civil disobedience and, in some instances, violence. Half (52%) have participated in a political movement before, virtually all (98%) say they would support civil disobedience to achieve their goals, and nearly one-third (31%) would support violence to advance their agenda.                
                

            
                The vast majority of demonstrators are actually employed, and the proportion of protesters unemployed (15%) is within single digits of the national unemployment rate (9.1%).

ObamaCare boosters are wrong about the American Health Care Act - just like they were about ObamaCare,"Do any of these lines sound familiar?
                
                    
                        
                    
                    
                        
                    
                
                


                
            
                If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your insurance plan, you can keep it. The Affordable Care Act will cut your yearly premiums by $2,500. The law will “bend the health care cost curve downward” and save taxpayer money. 
                
                


                
            
                Oh, and the website will be as easy to use as Amazon.  
                
                


                
            
                These are the arguments ObamaCare supporters, including in the liberal media, deployed to pass their federal health care takeover. They should sound familiar and completely unrelated to the experience of most Americans.
                
                


                
            
                Many in my home state of Tennessee lost the insurance plans they liked. Premium prices have almost doubled, and doctors are harder to find. Barack Obama promised his namesake law would boost the economy, but across the country, small and large businesses report ObamaCare harms their ability to hire and grow. 
                
                


                
            
                Under ObamaCare, for the first time in decades, average life expectancy in the U.S. declined, and the mortality rate rose.
                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            While not perfect, the new AHCA reflects conservative values of constitutionalism, limited government and the free market, containing an option for states to waive ObamaCare regulations that are driving up the cost of insurance.
					
		        
	        
        
    



                
                    
                        
                    
                
            
                Yet defenders of the indefensible, a law which cost Democrats the House of Representatives, Senate and White House, are making all sorts of dishonest claims about the American Health Care Act, a better alternative that will return stability and choice to the individual insurance market.
                
                


                
            
                Not only that, insurance would mean actual health care. High-deductible ObamaCare plans are barely worth the paper they’re printed on – much like reports that ObamaCare was just fine until Donald Trump came along. In reality, Tennesseans and others voted for the president in large numbers because local health insurance exchanges are near collapse. 
                
                


                
            
                Remember when ObamaCare creator Jonathan Gruber admitted Democrats relied on “the stupidity of the American voter” to foist their disaster on the public? Republicans, on the other hand, trust in Americans’ ability to see past the disinformation and make their own health care decisions with their own money, the idea at the heart of the AHCA. 
                
                


                
            
                Because our plan repeals billions of dollars of taxes on everything from prescription drugs to insurance itself, those voters will have more to invest in health care (or whatever they like). The AHCA expands health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, and tax credits to help low-income earners and middle-class families purchase insurance. 
                
                


                
            
                Importantly, it modernizes Medicaid to ensure only those who truly need the program take advantage. If you can believe it, ObamaCare's Medicaid expansion favors able-bodied adults over the poor and disabled who rely on the program. That’s unfair. 
                
                


                
            
                Charges that the AHCA discriminates against patients with pre-existing condition are untrue. In fact, the law contains funding to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses. Claims that the law punishes rape victims are cynical acts of desperation and proven false.     
                
                


                
            
                ObamaCare’s individual and business mandates are gone, another feature the Freedom Caucus and I liked about the original AHCA. Others we didn’t like as much, and my conservative colleagues and I worked hard to give states and consumers greater flexibility in the version that passed the House.  
                
                


                
            
                While not perfect, the new AHCA reflects conservative values of constitutionalism, limited government and the free market, containing an option for states to waive ObamaCare regulations that are driving up the cost of insurance.
                
                


                
            
                The AHCA is only the start. While the Senate considers the House bill, the President and his Secretary of Health and Human Services are making every effort to exempt individuals, families and businesses from ObamaCare regulations. HHS Secretary Tom Price, a conservative doctor like me, knows exactly what the Trump administration must do to help more people afford insurance.    
                
                


                
            
                Like me, he knows insurance is meaningless without access to good doctors and medicine. In Congress, the Freedom Caucus, GOP Doctors Caucus and other concerned members are working to expand generic drugs, reduce the costs of starting a medical practice, and to encourage life-saving medical innovation. 
                
                


                
            
                But opponents of real health care reform will say anything to protect ObamaCare at the expense of the people it hurts. To me, Americans’ well-being is more important than any party’s political legacy. And it's more important than insurance companies’ bottom lines. 
                
                


                
            
                Right now, numerous government bureaucracies are funneling taxpayer money to a few big insurers, whose profits are soaring along with the national debt. The object is to bring transparency to a process that’s become too convoluted and cumbersome to comprehend, much less afford. The price of an office visit or medical procedure shouldn’t be such a mystery.
                
                


                
            
                The truth is that Republicans are working hard to undo the damage ObamaCare has done and improve health care in America for all of us. We’re putting patients first.

                ORLANDO, Fla. –  Gov. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) was one of those Tea Party stars whom voters believed had the courage of his convictions when he promised, as recently as last summer, to block The Affordable Care Act in his state. But last week, writes the Orlando Sentinel, ""Scott made an abrupt about-face, embracing a three-year expansion of Medicaid coverage for about 1 million low-income Floridians that will be paid for by the health care law.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Scott said, ""I think this is a common-sense solution to dealing with this for the next three years where it will give us the time to think about how we can improve the system."" Sounding like a Democrat, he added that the state is obligated to help ""the poorest and weakest among us."" No, governor, charities and religious bodies are obligated to help the weak and poor. State and federal governments have no such obligation. To claim they do empowers bureaucrats and politicians who are having a difficult enough time fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities. It also undermines the work ethic.                
                

            
                After (borrowed) federal money runs out in three years, Florida will be expected to kick in some cash and carry on with the funding. Scott says his commitment is only for those three years, but as Ronald Reagan once wryly observed, ""...a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth!""                
                

            
                Scott, whose favorability rating was 36 percent in a December Quinnipiac University poll, is clearly looking at his vulnerability in next year's election. Apparently, he thinks sounding more like a Democrat will convince voters to give him another term in office. Perhaps he thinks the tea party votes he is likely to lose will be made up for with purchased votes from those who will line up at the federal ATM.                
                

            
                Scott is a former health care executive. The health care industry has spent millions lobbying to influence health care reform legislation, including Medicaid. They also are the largest employer in many states. Should Scott lose next year's election, taking federal Medicaid money won't hurt his chances of a high-paying position in his former profession.

                The Orlando Sentinel examined Scott's rapid turnaround on other issues dear to conservative hearts. It said he ""...has barely looked like the same guy who ran for governor in 2010"" and cited examples. After large initial budget cuts, Scott ""...proposed the largest budget in state history and said his top priority was a $2,500 raise for teachers, whom he infuriated during his first year in office by passing a merit-pay law while cutting education spending by $1.3 billion.""                
                

            
                Scott has also said nothing in several months about illegal immigration. He once pledged to back an Arizona-style immigration law that would require police to check the legal status of people they suspected were illegal. He has since backed away from this pledge.                
                

            
                Slade O'Brien, the Florida director of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, told the Sentinel he was ""flabbergasted"" by Scott's decision, saying it went beyond even his budget proposal that didn't cut spending and the teacher pay raises. ""For the governor to reverse that position, I felt incredibly shocked and so did many of his base,"" he said.                
                

            
                A few Republican governors have turned down federal money to expand Medicaid in their states. So far, Gov. Rick Perry (R-Texas) is not one of them. Last week he made his intentions clear when he said, ""We're not going to be expanding Medicaid in Texas. The reason is because it's a broken system. It's moving our state -- and I'll just speak to our state -- towards bankruptcy if we expand the current program.""                
                

            
                As for Gov. Scott's turnabout, a paraphrase of the wisdom Forrest Gump's momma gave him might fit: Politicians are like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're going to get until after they're elected.

Hospital crisis needs a healthy dose of faith,"My home state of Georgia is in the throes of a health care crisis.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Providers are cutting hours, hospitals are closing their doors, and Georgians -- black, white, brown, purple, rich and poor -- are suffering. Five hospitals have been shuttered in the past three years, and many more have reduced the services they provide.                
                

            
                As a minister and a concerned community member, I cannot stand by and idly watch this situation worsen. The Bible teaches that we have a moral responsibility to care for the most vulnerable among us. Proverbs 21:13 states, “He who shuts his ear to the cry of the poor will also cry himself and not be answered.” Their suffering is our suffering. But as we seek to face the reality of our daily challenges to keep health care accessible in Georgia, we must keep Washington from making the situation worse.                
                

            
                Hospitals, clinics and other treatment centers have to navigate myriad regulations handed down from federal and state statutes. More have been piled on since the passage of health care reform.                
                

            
                Today, a successful program that was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 to benefit critical access hospitals in poor rural and urban areas has become a congressional target -- the 340B program. The 340B program requires that pharmaceutical companies sell their outpatient drugs to safety-net hospitals at discounted prices. In return, they are able to participate in the federal Medicaid program and have access to many millions of guaranteed customers.                
                

            
                Scripture is clear on our moral obligation to help those in need, but history has taught us that depending on Washington for solutions is often a fool’s errand. Finally, in the 340B program, we’ve found something that works -- a revenue-neutral program that benefits safety-net hospitals serving low-income areas, often with large aging, minority, or infant populations, without costing taxpayers money.                
                

            
                It’s important that Congress leave this program alone, especially given the numerous other health care issues that demand immediate attention.                
                

            
                Georgia isn’t unique in its mounting hospital closures. Nationwide, 43 rural hospitals have closed since 2010. Inner-city hospitals have faced similar pressures, and experienced similar results. These hospitals and clinics are often major employers in their communities, as well as the last line of defense for life-saving treatments. As they scramble to keep their doors open, many have come to increasingly rely on the 340B program. Congressional cuts to the number of providers eligible to benefit from the program would be a mistake.                
                

            
                The mayor of Belhaven, N.C., walked the nearly 300 miles to Washington, D.C., last week to raise awareness for the plight of rural hospitals after his local hospital closed in 2014. With him was the Rev. William Barber, head of the North Carolina NAACP, an outspoken advocate for health care for low-income and minority populations.                
                

            
                While Rev. Barber and I differ in some of our views, we’re united by our faith and by a common background. Of course we likely agree that health affirming and health improving programs are needed. The health and livelihood of the unborn, mothers and women in general must be of the highest value in our society.                
                

            
                We also share a set of challenges that demand real world solutions while reducing the taxpayer burden, as the cost for government programs becomes too great for working Americans to bear.                
                

            
                My uncle, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said in 1964 that poverty “is one of the most urgent items on the agenda of modern life.” It’s as true today, unfortunately, as it was then. We must recognize effectiveness when we see it, cost-savings when we can, and moral responsibility at all times.                
                

            
                Anything less is both fiscally irresponsible and morally reprehensible."
Don't let ObamaCare debate derail search for lifesaving medical cures,"In one of their final votes before heading home for Congress’ annual summer recess, House Republicans voted to repeal ObamaCare – for the 40th time.                                              ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                While this bill will not go any further with the Democratic-controlled Senate than their last 39 attempts, the Republicans’ repeated efforts to vocalize their staunch opposition to the Affordable Care Act demonstrate how controversial the policy remains.                  
                

            
                The fight over Obama’s health care law will only become more heated when Congress reconvenes, as the new state insurance marketplaces – a signature piece of Obama’s law – are set to open for enrollment shortly thereafter.                  
                

            
                Some Republican Congressmen now say that unless the law is defunded, they will not pass a budget, which is needed to fund the government beyond September 30 in order to avoid a government shutdown.

                This partisan bickering is unproductive for our country and, more importantly, preventing us from addressing the real challenges facing our nation.                   
                

            
                Democrats and Republicans need to replace political fights over the budget and efforts to defund ObamaCare with the development of a pro-growth agenda that focuses on economic development, jobs, and innovation.                  
                

            
                Yet while our political leaders continue to fight about the details and implementation of a bill that was passed three years ago, radical achievements in other areas of health care are being overshadowed.                  
                

            
                A report released last week revealed there are currently 444 new medicines and treatments being tested by America’s biopharmaceutical research companies to treat and possibly even prevent a variety of debilitating neurological disorders.                
                

            
                There are over 600 neurological disorders affecting millions of Americans every year.  Some of these disorders are well known such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Multiple Sclerosis, while others are more obscure, but they are all severely crippling. In addition to physical suffering, these disorders cause both patients and their families immense pain and hardship, and cost the U.S. government billions of dollars.                  
                

            
                Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and affects roughly 5.4 million people. Without effective treatment, that number is expected to triple by 2050.  The current cost of care of Alzheimer’s patients to American society is $203 billion dollars -- a figure that is projected to increase to $1.2 trillion by 2050.                
                

            
                Recently, however, serious advances have been made in the treatment of neurological disorders. The boundaries of medical and scientific research are being pushed to new extremes, paving the way to innovative products that could potentially reverse the effects of or even prevent these devastating diseases entirely, reducing the overall cost to American society.                
                

            
                Among the 444 medicines in development are a few that represent truly revolutionary scientific approaches to medicine.                 
                

            
                For instance, several of these new medicines and treatments are using gene therapy to repair and restore damaged cells, enabling doctors to treat neurological disorders by replacing mutated genes or inactivating mutated genes that cause debilitating symptoms.                 
                

            
                A similar therapy, “Targeted RNAi Therapy,” is also in clinical testing stages.                
                

            
                In addition to providing patients and their families with hope, these groundbreaking scientific methods are helping researchers to understand more about the genes that affect the development of particular neurological disorders.                  
                

            
                A deeper understanding here could potentially lead to new ways of slowing or even reversing the effects of these diseases, which would cut costs significantly.                 
                

            
                According to the report, delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s by just 5 years could reduce the cost of care by $447 billion in 2050.                
                

            
                At a time when the implementation of health care reform remains a point of contention between the Democrats and Republicans, it is critical that we do not let these types of innovative medical achievements go unnoticed, or lose focus on the need for a continued national commitment to develop new, lifesaving medicines and treatments.                
                

            
                The persistent efforts of biopharmaceutical scientists in America have brought cutting-edge treatment options to patients, lessening the physical and emotional burdens of these disabling neurological diseases, and improving their overall quality of life.                   
                

            
                This in turn has significant impact on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our health care system.                  
                

            
                We simply cannot let ongoing battles surrounding our country’s health care system and the budget to allow us to lose sight of the importance of developing new medicines and treatments, and on medical innovation."
The ObamaCare spin machine revs up,"FILE - In this June 15, 2012 file photo, President Barack Obama announces his administration's immigration plans, in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington. There's not much President Barack Obama can do to boost the economy in the next five months, and that alone might cost him the November election.  But on a range of social issues, Obama is bypassing Congress and aggressively using his executive powers to make it easier for gays to marry, women to obtain birth control, and, now, young illegal immigrants to avoid deportation.

                There's been a recent flurry of activities attempting to boost the Affordable Care Act. In mid-June, for example, President Obama's ""Organizing for Action"" group reportedly spent seven figures on TV ads (in California, Florida and Texas) claiming, ""Americans are already seeing the benefits"" of health-care reform.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Also in June, the administration and an allied nonprofit, Enroll America, described how hundreds of thousands of community organizers will sign up seven million uninsured people for health coverage, once registration for subsidized insurance starts Oct. 1.                
                

            
                Then on July 2, the administration dropped a bombshell, delaying the employer mandate for a year.

                Even Democrats were taken aback. Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, one of the law's authors, was quoted in the New York Times saying, ""This was the law. How can they change the law?"" But the rule of law won't stop this White House from trying to reduce the damage from ObamaCare until after the 2014 midterm elections.

"Jobs Up, Unemployment Down -- The Numbers Prove U.S. Economy Is Finally Picking Up Steam","Friday, the Labor Department reported the economy added 216,000 jobs in March. After adding 194,000 jobs in February, this indicates the economy is finally accomplishing momentum. First quarter growth will likely be a bit higher than 3 percent.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Unemployment ticked a notch lower to 8.8 percent on the strength of jobs growth. Unlike past months, this improvement could not be attributed to adults leaving the labor force of emigration.                
                

            
                These gains are in sharp contrast to weaker gains the previous 13 months, and largely resulted from stronger, potentially self-sustaining private sector jobs growth.                
                

            
                As measured by GDP, the economic recovery began in July 2009; however, the economy did not begin adding jobs until January 2010, and gained only 76,000 jobs a month through January 2011. Too many of those jobs gains were created by stimulus spending, temporary business services, and health care and social services, which are heavily subsidized by federal and state governments. Job gains in the core private sector—private employment less temporary business services, and health care social services and temporary business services--averaged only 47,000 a month.                
                

            
                Core private sector jobs are so important, because those have the potential to set off a virtuous cycle of hiring, consumer spending and more hiring. In March and February, this barometer of private sector vitality gained 157,000 and 183,000 new positions, respectively. Similarly strong core private sector gains will be needed to continue adding 200,000 or more new jobs each month going forward.                
                

            
                The jobs drought may finally be over but important challenges remain.                
                

            
                Gains in the range of 200,000 a month are not enough to push unemployment down to acceptable levels. Continued dependence on foreign oil, the growing trade deficit with China, and health care and tax policies that penalize the location of businesses in the United States are responsible for slower jobs creation than has been accomplished during past recoveries and that could still be achieved.                
                

            
                The economy must add 13 million private sector jobs over the next three years—360,000 each month—to bring unemployment down to 6 percent. Core private sector jobs must increase at least 300,000 a month to accomplish that goal.                
                

            
                The economy is expanding at a 3 percent annual rate and this is barely enough to hold unemployment steady, because the working age population increases 1 percent a year, and productivity advances about 2 percent. Growth in the range of 4 to 5 percent is needed and possible to get unemployment down to 6 percent over the next several years.                
                

            
                Coming out of a deep recession, growth of 4 to 5 percent a year is certainly possible. However, continued dependence on high priced foreign oil, the growing trade deficit with China, and health care and tax policies that penalize the location of businesses in the United States are responsible for slower jobs creation than has been accomplished during past recoveries and that could still be achieved.                
                

            
                Simply put, more jobs could be created by drilling for more domestic oil now, which would keep money here that American drivers send to the Middle East; taxing dollar-yuan conversion to offset China’s undervalued currency and 35 percent subsidy on its exports; genuine health care reform that lowers drug, insurance administration and tort burdens rather than subsidizing a system that costs 50 percent more than private systems in Germany and elsewhere; and replacing the corporate income tax and elements of the personal income and social security tax with a value-added tax.

Our Next President Cinches Nomination,"After five states hold primaries this week, President Barack Obama is all but certain to officially win the number of delegates needed to be the Democratic nominee for the 2012 presidential election --- an election he will most likely win.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                On camera and in print, Republican officials and strategists are boastful about GOP prospects to take the presidency. But behind the scenes, even the most publicly audacious Republicans are quite sanguine about their fall prospects. It’s partly about Mitt Romney. The Republican base had to hold its collective nose to support Romney and, even then, he only narrowly achieved front-runner status and remains outright detested by high margins of the party faithful.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                But frankly, even if Ronald Reagan himself were to rise from the grave --- and be allowed to run as a Republican within an increasingly, aggressively Right wing party --- there is little chance that Republicans would win back the White House this fall. Why? No doubt some of you reading this can’t manage to find a single thing likeable about President Obama or his leadership. You, however, are not the voters who decide general elections. And while you have already decided who to vote for, among independent and swing voters the election is literally just beginning. No debates yet. No ads. No chance for the President to present the facts of his Administration’s accomplishments and poke holes in the job-destroying record of Governor Romney.                
                

            
                What record, you scoff with the putrid taste of partisanship in your mouth? Suck on this:                
                

            
                ·Job Creation: When President Obama took office, the economy was losing over 700,000 jobs per month. Through March 2012, the President’s policies have added 4.1 million new private sector jobs. That’s 25 consecutive months of positive, private sector job growth.                
                

            
                ·Investing in American Manufacturing: Under President Obama, America has seen its first year-over-year manufacturing job growth since 1997. And notably, the President saved the American auto industry --- the engine and pride of American manufacturing and a move for which 1 million American workers are clearly grateful.                
                

            
                ·Health Care Reform: Under the President’s Affordable Care Act, 34 million Americans --- who were previously uninsured and making us all pay more when they used ER treatment for primary care --- will now have health insurance. The American people agreed that something had to be done about runaway costs and the lack of comprehensive coverage, and the President took the leadership not to make excuses or put up obstacles but do something about the problem.                
                

            
                ·Tax Cuts: President Obama cut taxes for 95% of American families. Meanwhile, most millionaires and billionaires pay lower taxes than average Americans. The President supports raising taxes on the very wealthy instead of cutting Medicare and public education --- a move that the majority of voters also support.                
                

            
                ·National Security: See, e.g., Osama bin Laden.                
                

            
                I could go on. An energy policy that doesn’t just give handouts to the wealthy dirty oil businesses of the past but invests in the energy --- and economy --- of the future. Standing up for equal pay for women and reproductive choice. Raising public school standards and doubling investments in scholarships. No one in the President’s camp is going to argue the economy is as strong as we’d all wish nor that the work of fixing our health care system or public schools is complete. Indeed, I’ve spent much of my energy criticizing the President for not doing more on these fronts --- taking even bolder leadership with less regard for the carping and moaning obstructionism of Republicans. But make no mistake about it, as our nation’s leader during the second-worst economic recession in history, President Obama has a very strong record to fight on. And, as the saying goes, he’s only just begun to fight.                
                

            
                Things might look better for Mitt Romney had he created more jobs than he killed in the pursuit of his personal fortune. Or had he stuck to a consistent set of principles instead of flip-flopping his way across the electoral landscape of his career. Or if he would stop talking about his friends who don’t just watch NASCAR races but own them. Or if, instead of falling woefully behind President Obama on personal likeability polls, Romney would take a page from the Tupac concert and fashion a more warm and friendly hologram of himself to hit the campaign trail.                
                

            
                Still, even if Mitt Romney could pull off the impossible and become a likeable candidate without a checkered personal and political history, he would still be running against a very strong opponent with a very strong record. Oh yeah, not to mention the incumbent. But Romney and the Republicans will keep pinning their hopes on a dream of a chance at victory, while President Obama hangs his hat on the very real and very impressive accomplishments of his leadership.

Opinion: Not voting in November could mean a 'wall' between you and your healthcare,"BERLIN, GERMANY - SEPTEMBER 05:  A doctor uses a stethoscope on a patient on September 5, 2012 in Berlin, Germany. Doctors in the country are demanding higher payments from health insurance companies (Krankenkassen). Over 20 doctors' associations are expected to hold a vote this week over possible strikes and temporary closings of their practices if assurances that a requested additional annual increase of 3.5 billion euros (4,390,475,550 USD) in payments are not provided. The Kassenaerztlichen Bundesvereinigung (KBV), the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, unexpectedly broke off talks with the health insurance companies on Monday.

                Over the past few weeks, tens of millions of Americans tuned in to the political conventions. And not surprisingly, Obamacare was a central issue during both conventions. One party chanting for its repeal, the other touting its successes.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                During his address, Donald Trump chalked up the need to repeal and replace Obamacare to the fact that you will be able to “choose your own doctor again.” This was in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton’s mention of Obamacare which she says has insured 20 million people since its adoption.                
                

            
                So, why does the GOP have such a doom and gloom view of Obamacare? And why have they spent the past six years challenging the most comprehensive and inclusive health legislation ever passed by Congress? For starters, they might not want you to know that it’s working – particularly for the Latino community. And, that you actually CAN choose your own doctor, among other benefits.                
                

            
                In the six years since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed, we have made great strides to address health disparities in the Latino community. Before health care reform, 32 percent of Latinos were uninsured – the highest uninsurance rate of any racial or ethnic group in the United States. That lack of insurance was particularly troubling as Latinos tend to suffer from many illnesses and chronic health conditions at much higher rates than white Americans.                
                

            
                Since its enactment, the ACA has resulted in more than 4 million Latino adults gaining insurance coverage. Nearly 9 million Latinos with private insurance can now access free preventative healthcare, including flu shots, mammograms, depression and cervical cancer screenings. They can no longer be dropped by their insurer just because they get sick. Major federal investments and ongoing reforms to our health care system will soon improve the quality of care and management of chronic diseases. So it’s clear that Latinos stand to lose the most during a Donald Trump presidency.

                Regardless of the progress we have made in increasing health equity, Obamacare has faced (and survived) two Supreme Court challenges and more than 60 repeal votes. Just a few months ago, Congressional Republicans came closer to repeal than ever before by using a fast-track legislative tool that sent a repeal bill to President Obama’s desk with only a simple majority in the Senate (it was of course vetoed).                
                

            
                While Obamacare seems invincible, it’s important that voters and supporters of the law not become complacent. Make no mistake, this election marks a critical juncture for Obamacare and our country. One that presents both opportunities and challenges for health reform, and will determine whether we want a more equitable, accessible, and patient-centered health system, or whether we reverse course toward a system of increasing health disparities.                
                

            
                Still, there is much more work to be done to ensure that the Latino community receives the high quality and equitable health care they deserve. While blacks and whites have seen their uninsured rates decrease by 50 percent as a result of Obamacare, Latinos have only seen theirs fall by 25 percent. According to the Urban Institute, 1 in 5 Latino adults are still uninsured and most are unaware of financial assistance available through the ACA. This means we have more to do to make sure Latinos fully realize all of the benefits accruing from the ACA. Health providers, promotoras de salud, navigators and other community leaders must do a better job connecting with Latino communities to educate them about the health insurance marketplace and the many low cost coverage options available.                
                

            
                So, where should the Latino community go from here? First, go to healthcare.gov to explore options if you haven’t already. Open enrollment for getting into the ACA health insurance exchange is fast approaching and you might not want to miss out.                
                

            
                From there, go to the polls this November. It’s not only important that you cast your vote to ensure the right presidential candidate makes it to the White House, but that you are making your voice heard when it comes to electing local and state legislators. They are often the ones making decisions on state healthcare matters, so make them aware of the issues and how you want them to act on your behalf.                
                

            
                Because not voting could mean waking up on November 9 to find a “wall” built between you and the healthcare coverage that is your right and privilege.

                My business takes me out of the country very often. I was in Mexico last week and listened to the radio and TV when President Obama was talking to young people at the Museum of Anthropology. He was well received by them and I wondered whether he appealed to them as he did to the young people in the United States five long years ago. The broad smile, the inspirational speech, the beautiful setting, all seemed to be just right to deliver a hopeful message.                                             ADVERTISEMENT

                So it was ironic to see him there for a wonderful photo op while trouble was brewing in DC —big trouble. I could be just as critical and cynical as the next guy, but that is not what this is about. I am profoundly troubled by all that is happening under this president’s watch. More than the scandals are the tragic consequences of what has transpired by either negligence, dereliction of duty, or outright malfeasance.                
                

            
                Whether we are talking about the Benghazi tragedy, which appears to be a cover up; the IRS targeting of conservative groups and those who apparently oppose this president; or the massive subpoena of AP phone records and the public handling by this administration, especially by the White House, it is cause to give us all a huge pause. I won’t even go into the lies we were told about the health care reform and the implementation fundraising controversy surrounding Secretary Sibelius.                
                

            
                It is beyond comprehension how this administration has gone so astray. It pains me to even think that we are at the verge of losing the foundation of our existence as a country. The principles on which our country was founded are in danger of being destroyed. More than anything else I am in shock. Yes, there is outrage out there as there should be, and not just from Republicans. Yet what I feel is a considerable sense of sadness.                
                

            
                Finally the press is being awaken as to what has slowly crept up, but only because it finally hit them directly. The media, the greatest apologists for President Obama, have finally realized that their own creation has come back to haunt them. The mere thought that our federal government would threaten one of the most fundamental freedoms –the freedom of the press– should have a chilling effect on the way we look at this president.

                Unhappily it reminds me of the renowned First they came… poem by Pastor Martin Niemöller. First, they went after their opponent; the media not only stayed silent but also enabled them; then they went after their opponent’s supporters via the IRS and the media stood by, but now they are going after the media and that is the most dangerous.                 
                

            
                There are places in this earth where that happens, where it is the way it is. But here in the United States we should not stand idly by; as a matter of fact we should all defend that freedom with our own voices. Too many have died to give us that freedom. It is our sacred duty to defend it, or there will be no one to speak for us.

How the left and progressive foundations gave us ObamaCare -- a law hated by so many,"(AP)
	                        
	                    
	                
                
            
        
    

    


                        






    
        
        
        
            
                As pundits and the public eagerly await the Supreme Court’s ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act – aka ObamaCare – it’s worth pondering how a nation mired in a debt crisis and an economic recession has become embroiled in a political fight that addresses neither problem.
 
 This quandary is all the more puzzling because polls show that half the country, including nearly 40 percent of Democrats, opposes all or part of the health care law. But then, popular appeal was never a factor in ObamaCare's passage. When President Obama assumed office, public opinion and a strong bipartisan consensus held that the economy was the primary issue facing the country. Deaf to the national mood, the president instead declared that “we can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold.”
 
 Then as now, Obama's choice seems to defy logic. In fact, it is less surprising than it may seem that from the get-go Obama made expanding government’s role in health care a top legislative priority – even as the ailing economy was paramount for most voters. As we show in our just published book, ""The New Leviathan,"" what seems like a case of profoundly misplaced priorities is really a tribute to the disproportionate capacity of the champions of universal health care on the left, backed by the financial might of progressive foundations, to bring their agenda to bear at the national level.
 
 President Obama was not the first to pursue universal health care, but before him those efforts had always failed politically.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In 1945, President Harry Truman proposed a sweeping “economic bill of rights” that included a right to universal health-care coverage but was repeatedly rebuffed by Congress.                 
                

            
                The late Ted Kennedy took up the issue in the 70s, deeming health care “a fundamental right and not just a privilege,” but his ambitious plan to make health care a universal government benefit failed to win the support of even liberal stalwarts like Jimmy Carter.                 
                

            
                Most recently, Hillary Clinton almost singlehandedly engineered a Republican takeover of the House in 1994 after her secretive attempt to push through a 1,367-page bill that would have forced all Americans to purchase health insurance and socialized one-seventh of the economy, galvanized a popular backlash.                
                

            
                Because these efforts to pass universal health care met with repeat failure, many failed to notice that even as the left's agenda stalled in Congress it won an important constituency: tax-free progressive foundations.                 
                

            
                In 1989, the Ford Foundation published a report called ""The Common Good: Social Welfare and the American Future"" concluding that “The national goal should be universal health coverage for all Americans.” The Rockefeller Foundation announced that it working to “support the transformation of health systems toward universal health coverage.” The Tides Foundation described universal health care as one of the organization’s “fundamental principles.”
 
 Perhaps most influential was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the largest philanthropy focused exclusively on health care. Long a backer of universal health care coverage, the foundation spent millions in the 90s backing state and national efforts to pass legislation expanding government-provided health care and even sponsored community forums in which Hillary Clinton promoted her health-care plan—this despite being ostensibly nonpartisan. Such was the foundation's financial influence on the health care debate that by 1995 it alone accounted for almost 45 percent of all giving in the area of health policy in America.
 
 While that was not enough to purchase the passage of HillaryCare, the left learned an important lesson. Massive expenditure of funds on health care advocacy could keep universal health care in the national discussion even when there was no national support for it. The realization gave rise to a series of single-issue political coalitions funded by foundations and advocating for universal health care legislation – with lasting consequences for health care policy.
 
 The most successful of these coalitions was Health Care for America Now (HCAN). Created shortly after Obama won the Democratic nomination in July 2008, HCAN's twenty-one-member steering committee included such left-wing groups as ACORN, the Center for American Progress, MoveOn.org, the National Council of La Raza, and the Center for Community Change. Those groups in turn enjoyed the support of the leading left-wing foundations, ranging from the well-known Ford Foundation to health-care-focused funds like the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Though its members groups were sustained by millions in foundations' grants, HCAN styled itself as a ""grassroots"" campaign -- this even as it pledged to spend $40 million to make health-care reform a reality.
 
 Amplifying HCAN's voice on health care was its alliance with public sector unions like the Service Employees International Union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the United Food and Commercial Workers union.                 
                

            
                This was a novel development in American politics, since unions hadn’t always supported health care. Labor leaders like Samuel Gompers, the legendary head of the American Federation of Labor, opposed mandatory health insurance on the grounds that it was “paternalistic and repugnant.” But as unions’ membership dwindled, they came to see government's involvement in health care as a lifeline that would turn health care workers into government union members while maintaining their generous pay and benefit packages.
 
 HCAN thus represented a tremendous arsenal of financial resources -- and it used it to its advantage. HCAN launched a media campaign urging health care reform that included a $1.5 million ad buy in national print, online, and broadcast media, all part of an eventual $25 million media blitz. Before long, HCAN was able to claim that its goals “are supported by President Obama, Vice President Biden, and more than 190 members of Congress.""                 
                

            
                This proved no idle boast, as the Obama administration and Congressional Democrats moved full speed ahead with a socialized health care plan, which became known as “ObamaCare.” HCAN was just one of several health-care focused coalitions that leveraged their foundation-funded might into a decisive role in the health care debate.   
 
 This history helps explain why President Obama and other supporters of an increased government role in health care won't be chastened even if the Supreme Court strikes down the health care law. Already, the Obama administration is threatening to move ahead with major parts of the law if its most controversial provision, the individual mandate, does not survive. Government health care may be pronounced politically dead, but as it has so often in the past, the left’s million-dollar money machine is determined to keep it on life support.

ObamaCare repeal: GOP leaders are missing their chance,"Now Playing                            White House and GOP push to revive health care reform                                                                                                 
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                America has endured for generations because our Constitutional framework and our collective commitment to liberty protects us against the inevitable failures of our government and its leadership. Yet, when it comes to the current debate over health care, GOP leaders are abandoning these safeguards and risking not just our access to quality health care but something far greater.                                               ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                To be sure, most tangibly for the many Americans for whom rising health care costs and diminishing access to quality care is a very real, daily concern, the decisions we make will have lasting and very serious consequences. These are the reasons to fully repeal ObamaCare immediately and to then respect the states and the free market to give us the options to get the best health care possible.                 
                

            
                Yet, incomprehensibly, Congressional leaders are choosing not to do so and have abandoned their constituents in a series of negotiations – most recently for state “waivers” and other crumbs of liberty – that have little actual hope of meaningfully honoring their campaign commitments to fully repeal ObamaCare and reform health care markets.  Unfortunately, there are much larger implications to their lack of boldness.                
                

            
                First, Congress is turning away from the free market.  Republicans talk a big game about believing in free enterprise and capitalism. But the grassroots out in real America see their actions as more cronyism than principle. Whether it’s subsidizing big corporations through the Export-Import Bank or the more recent $100 billion insurer slush fund included in the American Health Care Act, the grassroots understandably consider Congress’ actions to be political pay-offs and more of Washington picking winners and losers rather than the free market at work.                
                

            
                So when those who claim to promote freedom refuse to legislatively repeal market-constricting regulations and then “replace” ObamaCare subsidies with new -- and arguably more expansive -- subsidies in the form of refundable tax credits, it makes one wonder.  Which party is for less government intervention?                  
                

            
                Second, Congress is continuing the trend of ceding its Article I legislating powers to others, in particular the administrative state.  The Legislative Branch – hiding behind the intricacies of Senate rules and the Budget Act – has been selling “repeal” in a future second phase at the hands of the Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Tom Price’s ability to repeal ObamaCare administratively.  Setting aside the fact little meaningful repeal can be accomplished administratively beyond tinkering at the margins, the more troubling concern is why our elected leaders refuse to just do what they have the power and duty to do and have repeatedly promised to do.                 
                

            
                This is a pattern. Congress frequently punts. Take President Obama’s illegal Executive Amnesty. The Congressional GOP could have used its Article I powers to stop funding any implementation of that executive action.  But it didn’t even entertain that idea, choosing instead to leave it to states like Texas to fight in the courts.  Moreover, during the 2013 defund fight, Republican Congressional leaders hid behind not having 50 votes in the Senate and not having a GOP-controlled White House. The conservative grassroots being skeptical of their position questioned their sincerity. And here we are.  Since the repeal effort stalled, a possible “deal” is being floated to permit Governors to seek “waivers.” The simple truth is Republicans seemingly would rather hide behind conjecture and procedural theory while punting responsibility.                
                

            
                Third, the health care debate today centers almost entirely on the word “repeal,”  and while it has been a rallying cry for conservatives, it is too much now an end to itself.  It’s just a word.  And it’s a word that is all about process and politics, not really substance.  Congressional leadership is so wrapped up in the idea of “repeal,” that it has become a political box-checking exercise rather than a commitment to ensure Americans actually receive better health care at more affordable costs.                
                

            
                Worse, this exercise is not actually checking the box! If one aims to repeal ObamaCare – a law built upon subsidies, regulations and Medicaid expansion – how can one honestly look at your constituents and claim to have repealed it with a new law built upon subsidies, regulations and continued, albeit slightly limited, Medicaid expansion? Even if they allow a theoretical waiver for states, it defies common sense to claim this is repeal.                
                

            
                Finally and most importantly, GOP leaders are missing their chance to win the minds and hearts of the American people. They are denying a new generation of Americans the ability to understand and embrace constitutionally limited government, federalism, free markets and the opportunities those ideals create.                  
                

            
                The Republican Party has been afforded a historic moment in time to transform America’s health care system to one that offers the best we could dream of – plenty of doctors, low cost insurance options, affordable medicine - all while maximizing the number of individuals receiving the care they need.                 
                

            
                Instead, Congressional leaders are defining the debate in terms of tax reductions and supposed out-year cost savings instead of how to increase the supply of high quality health care that is available and affordable to actual human beings.                  
                

            
                This fight over health care reform will come and go, but the lasting impact of how it is fought will be significant.                  
                

            
                If Congress is nothing more than a box-checking regime that will overstate its own actions to claim success while further ceding its own Constitutional powers and abandoning the free market – then America will completely lose its identity.                
                

            
                This is what is at stake.                 
                

            
                Congress has a choice – and it ought to choose the principles that made this country great and that they claim to believe in, not the failed Washington-centric policies that have been the problem all along.

              Great news! Hillary Clinton has finally figured out What Happened! It wasn’t, after all, James Comey or racism or Vladimir Putin or sexism or the hostile media that torpedoed her bid for the White House. Instead, it was…(drumroll please…) millions of Stepford wives, voting the way their husbands told them to.
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In her insatiable thirst for redemption Hillary casts an ever-wider net, trying to scoop up those responsible for her defeat. Speaking in India recently, she again revisited her stinging 2016 election loss, this time hauling in white women, who vote the way “your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              What an offense to the millions of women who didn’t trust Hillary, didn’t like Hillary, and didn’t think she had earned the right to be our first female president.  And what an embarrassment to her party, some of whom have disavowed her comments. Senator Claire McCaskill, for instance, who is battling to be reelected in red state Missouri, criticized Hillary’s remarks; nonetheless, the Republican opponent hoping to dislodge McCaskill wasted no time tying her to Clinton, whom she previously had endorsed.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              


              
          
              Republicans hope Hillary will hang around, reminding Trump voters how delighted they are that she isn’t president. More and more Democrats would like her to disappear Stage Left, for good.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              According to one survey, 61 percent of white women without a college degree voted for Donald Trump as did 45 percent of white women who graduated from college.  Did all those tens of millions of females simply do as they were told by the men in their lives? Please, women are not that compliant or that stupid.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The irony is, of course, that Hillary would never have been a candidate for president but for the men in her life. It was husband Bill who pushed her forward from the start and, against all odds, became a beloved leader of the Democratic Party. And she would never have come close to cracking the glass ceiling but for the dogged efforts of President Obama, who saw her as willing to carry on his legacy.
              
             
               
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Democrats who put gender ahead of the economy, or jobs, or national security, or who think that their dogmatic positions on abortion or equal pay are the only key to winning elections, are insulting women. 
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              Remember, she was such a terrible candidate that she almost lost the Democratic primary battle to a septuagenarian Socialist who had been in Congress for 24 years and never passed a significant piece of legislation. And that was with the DNC not only rallying behind her but cheating on her behalf as well.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It was Bill who put Hillary on the national stage in 1992, breaking with long-standing convention to give his wife a policy role early in his administration. That she immediately flamed out after trying to craft a health care reform program, offending allies and opponents alike by running roughshod over them, should have raised red flags about her political IQ.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It was Bill who begrudgingly campaigned for her victorious rival Barack Obama in 2008, presumably in exchange for some guarantee that Hillary would win the latter’s backing when her turn came. And it was Bill who lent her his popularity and who pushed her to address disaffected white, working-class voters during the campaign -- advice which she ignored.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The insulting remarks in India were not Hillary’s first broadside against her own gender. During Bill’s first run for president, she explained that she had chosen the unusual path of working while he was governor by saying “I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas.” Though Hillary tried to walk the sarcasm back, women not in the workplace knew they had been dissed.   
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Hillary is not the only liberal who blames white women for her defeat.  Michelle Obama also railed about how women were, well, wrong to vote for Donald Trump. In a speech in Boston, the former First Lady said, “As far as I'm concerned, any woman who voted against Hillary Clinton voted against their own voice in a way.” Like Hillary, Michelle thinks women were simply following orders: “Well, to me that just says you don’t like your voice. You like the thing we’re told to like.”
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Told to like? How about, saw the big picture?
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              For voters overall, and for women, the economy and terrorism were the top issues in 2016. Hillary flunked on both counts. She promised to continue the economic policies of her boss Barack Obama, who produced the most lackluster recovery in the country’s history. Not only did she propose raising taxes on businesses and the wealthy – though she surely knew such measures would prove harmful to growth – she also came out against what she disparaged as the “gig” economy. This, as Millennials and women, in particular, applaud the flexibility that comes with jobs provided by new start-ups and technological innovation.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              On terrorism, Hillary was on more solid ground, since even she had criticized Obama for lacking a robust foreign policy. As she said, “""Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don’t do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle."" Unfortunately for Hillary, she made those remarks in 2014. By the time the election was in full swing, she had attached herself to Obama’s coattails as firmly as a face is planted on Mt. Rushmore; veering more hawkish on Syria or ISIS, for instance, was simply not an option.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Democrats who put gender ahead of the economy, or jobs, or national security, or who think that their dogmatic positions on abortion or equal pay are the only key to winning elections, are insulting women. Many men and women understand that providing policies that unleash the growth of the economy is essential to the ambitions of our nation. Bolstering our entitlements programs, funding health care for the needy, improving our education system and strengthening our military all require revenues that will only come from an expanding economy.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              That growth is what President Trump promised, and what he is delivering. And that is why he won.

Why this doctor is glad that Trump wants to take on big pharma (and protect  Americans from drug makers' greed),"Now Playing                            Trump: You're going to be proud of plan to replace ObamaCare                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                Health care reform has been a big part of the election of 2016.  While the Affordable Care Act (aka ObamaCare) has taken center stage, many have wondered what may happen to the pharmaceutical and medical device industries under a Trump presidency.  Wednesday, President-elect Trump made the answer quite clear — no more price gouging.                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                In the last year, we have all heard about the significant price hikes of the Epi Pen made by Mylan pharmaceuticals. Mylan and CEO Heather Bresch are just one example of price gouging, price fixing and collusion among pharmaceutical companies.                 
                

            
                Many other drugs are also increasing in cost at alarming rates, without any real plausible explaination. Most concerning is the fact that while consumers have seen a 500 percent increase in the cost of the Epi Pen, Ms Bresch has seen a nearly 700 percent increase in her own salary over the last few years.                
                

            
                Mylan is definitely not alone in its greed. Last year the CEO of Turing, Martin Shkreli increased the price of an important (and relatively cheap) drug in the treatment of HIV related illness nearly 5000 percent.                
                

            
                Countless other cases of inflated drug prices have come to light in recent months.                 
                

            
                In Europe, a precedent has been set when in late 2016 drug maker Pfizer was fined a record 85 million pounds by the National Health Service for unfairly raising the price of an old epilepsy drug by 2,400 percent.                 
                

            
                It is clear that price gouging is not limited to newly developed or expensive biologic/designer drugs–even the price of insulin (which has been around for decades) has gone up nearly 300 percent.                
                

            
                Insulin and other medicines like it are drugs that are used to treat common diseases (like diabetes) that many patients NEED daily just in order to LIVE.                
                

            
                 Are we now going to allow some in the pharmaceutical industry to maximize their profits at the expense of the health of children with Type I diabetes?                 
                

            
                Wednesday, President-elect Trump took dead aim at the pharmaceutical industry in his noon press conference.  He made it clear that he will take steps to regulate the pharmaceutical industry because “they are getting away with murder”.                   
                

            
                Mr. Trump stated that he will seek to immediately allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices—no longer will government programs be forced to pay whatever pharmaceutical companies ask.                 
                

            
                He suggested that open bidding by suppliers to provide drugs for Medicare would be an important way to manage cost and potentially save billions of healthcare dollars.                 
                

            
                Mr. Trump noted that the pharmaceutical lobby has been a dominant force in Washington and has been instrumental in keeping prices high. It appears that the President-elect will take quick steps to address the growing national crisis of drug costs.                  
                

            
                Currently the U.S. pays far more for drugs than any other developed nation. We bear the costs of research and development for the rest of the world.  While it is critical to innovation that we reward new developments, we must create limits to how much (and for how long) drug makers can charge exorbitant prices.                 
                

            
                Its Time that We Hold Pharmaceutical Executives Accountable                
                

            
                As a physician and patient advocate, one of the biggest barriers to treatment in my practice is the cost of therapy.                 
                

            
                 Patients want to get well and want to do what is needed to stay healthy. However, many simply cannot afford to purchase their medications—even with assistance programs.                  
                

            
                Pharmaceutical companies MUST do better and I believe that  President Trump will work to make sure that they provide quality products at AFFORDABLE prices in the future.                 
                

            
                 Congress MUST look at amending patent protection laws and must also review the rules and regulations concerning the production and cost of generic medications.                  
                

            
                We must allow Americans to purchase drugs from reputable pharmacies from Canada and other locations in order to lower costs at home.                  
                

            
                Most importantly we must ensure that our government does not overpay for common, low cost drugs simply to line the pockets of pharmaceutical executives and shareholders.                 
                

            
                Initially following the election, drug stocks soared as investors anticipated less regulation and more free market competition in this space.                  
                

            
                Wednesday, things retreated immediately following his comments with the health sector already down several percentage points.  Mylan and Bristol Myers Squibb immediately dropped nearly 4 percent while others such as Pfizer and and Allergan dropped 3 percent.                  
                

            
                It  is my hope that leaders in the pharmaceutical world will begin to work with Mr. Trump and Congress to find better and most cost effective ways to lower the cost of needed and life saving prescription drugs.                 
                

            
                 It appears that with the signing of the 21st Century Cures Act in December, the process for getting drugs approved by the FDA will become much more streamlined and less costly—providing a cost reduction to the pharmaceutical and device industries that should be passed along to patients.                
                

            
                I believe that in his press conference Wednesday, President-elect Trump showed that he is going to stand up for patients and work to reduce the cost of health care in the U.S.                 
                

            
                While drug prices are just one aspect of a very complex system, I think that it is a great place to start.                  
                

            
                Finally, my patients may be able to afford their pills.

"Romney, Gingrich, Huntsman and Health Care Hypocrisy","What do Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney, the leading contenders for the Republican presidential nomination, have in common?
Long before President Obama even entered the Oval Office, both men supported an idea they now pretend to spurn — the idea of requiring people to buy health insurance.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                As recently as 2009, Romney publicly supported, the “individual mandate” for buying health insurance. And as recently as last month one of Gingrich’s websites still endorsed the “mandate” for all Americans earning more than $50,000 annually.                
                

            
                Romney and Gingrich are not alone in their history of supporting the idea of a government requirement that everyone buy health insurance. As governor of Utah in 2007, Jon Huntsman endorsed a health care reform plan from the United Way of Salt Lake City that called for a mandate.                
                

            
                “I think if you’re going to get it done and get it done right, the mandate has to be part of it in some way, shape or form,” he said at the time.                
                

            
                Gingrich, Romney and Huntsman are wide open to charges of political hypocrisy.                
                

            
                They apparently feel the need to fake their outrage over the individual mandate to win the GOP nomination. In an age of outrageous political posturing — telling lies and daring anyone to call you on it — this is the strongest indicator of the current lack of leadership and honest political debate about major national problems.                
                

            
                And it is not even good politics.                
                

            
                A CNN poll taken in November found that support for the individual mandate rose to its highest level yet, with 52 percent in favor and 47 percent opposed. The previous poll taken in June found that 54 percent opposed it and 44 percent supported it. That shift to support for the individual mandate is likely to grow as more parts of the overall Affordable Healthcare Act go into effect over the next two years.                
                

            
                At the moment, polling results on the overall national health care reform plan range from support between 38 percent and 40 percent and opposition between 44 percent and 48 percent (Quinnipiac and Kaiser Family polling). That split is pretty good for a plan filled with so many unknowns.                
                

            
                But as the GOP contenders face waves of strong conservative voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, united principally by a distaste for Obama, those candidates have concluded it is wise to pretend to have no connection with Obama’s signature legislation. Tea Party anger at the Democrats’ health care reform plan did drive the success of Republican candidates who won big in the 2010 midterm elections.                
                

            
                But times change.                
                

            
                Now national polls show support for the Tea Party is lower than support for Occupy Wall Street, and falling fast. And already Americans express support for key elements of the health care reform legislation that have been implemented, including allowing young adults to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans until they are twenty six.                
                

            
                Similarly, support is high for requiring insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing medical conditions as well as closing the so-called “doughnut hole” in subsidies that help seniors pay for prescription drugs.                
                

            
                The general election campaign is going to be even more distant from angry Tea Party activists. By the 2012 general election, the eventual GOP nominee is going to be open to charges of flip-flopping on healthcare reform. He will also find himself out of step with the American people who know the status quo on healthcare is expensive and leaves them vulnerable to the profit-driven prerogatives of insurance companies.                
                

            
                Romney, Gingrich and Huntsman have to realize they are playing a losing game in terms of general election politics.                
                

            
                At the CNN debate this October in Las Vegas, Gingrich took a swipe at Romney over the former Massachusetts governor’s healthcare plan that requires citizens in the Bay State to buy health insurance. Romney shot back: “Newt, we got the idea of individual mandate from you.”                
                

            
                Gingrich responded: “You did not get that from me. You got that from the Heritage Foundation.”                
                

            
                They are both correct on this revealing point. The Heritage Foundation, the influential conservative think tank, first developed the idea of an individual mandate for healthcare in the late 1980s. That is how deeply this idea is tied to conservative thinkers.                
                

            
                Romney used the Heritage policy in developing his Massachusetts health care law. That reform contained the dreaded individual mandate.                
                

            
                And Gingrich supported the federal mandate as an alternative to Hillary Clinton’s health care reform package when he was Speaker in the 1990s.                
                

            
                If Republican voters heard Gingrich and Romney speak honestly about health care reform — and why they came to appreciate and support the good of the individual mandate — my bet is that most GOP and independent voters would be more impressed than they are with the blatant lies now being told on the campaign trail.

"Sen. John McCain: You were fed ObamaCare lies, America. Here's what must happen now","Now Playing                            As ObamaCare premiums rise, so does cost to taxpayers                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                As the old adage goes, “If you don’t change your direction, you’re likely to end up where you’re headed.” When it comes to health care in America, Democrats’ refusal to change course on ObamaCare – even as it crumbles across the country – will lead us to more skyrocketing costs and decreased quality of care.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This week, the Obama administration confirmed that monthly premiums for benchmark plans are set to rise by an average of 25 percent in the 39 states participating in ObamaCare’s federal marketplace. About one-in-five consumers will have just one provider to choose from.                
                

            
                As bad as these numbers are, they don’t paint the full picture of the burdens many across the country will face come open enrollment next week.                  
                

            
                In my home state of Arizona, a 27-year-old shopping for benchmark plans will see their premiums rise by an average 116 percent. For Arizonans selecting other plans, the situation is just as bad, with premiums set to increase by 51 to 74.5 percent.                
                

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	    
		        
		            In my home state of Arizona, a 27-year-old shopping for benchmark plans will see their premiums rise by an average 116 percent. For Arizonans selecting other plans, the situation is just as bad, with premiums set to increase by 51 to 74.5 percent.
					
		        
	        
        
    


            
                In Maricopa County – Arizona’s most populous county, which includes the city of Phoenix – the 126,000 citizens who have enrolled in ObamaCare will only have one health provider option. According to state regulators, that would mean more than $1,400 per month for a family of four and nearly $500 per month for a middle age man for a benchmark silver plan. Those who can’t afford these expensive plans will be forced to pay a penalty.                
                

            
                This is a far cry from the promise of more “choice, more competition, [and] real health care security,” that President Obama once declared.                
                

            
                When the president and Congressional Democrats traveled the country touting their so-called “Affordable Care Act” back in 2009, my Republican colleagues and I were quick to highlight that their proposals, however well-intentioned, would only make health care worse for American families. It doesn’t take a Ph.D. to recognize that injecting unprecedented levels of government control into what amounts to nearly one-fifth of the nation’s economy would have devastating consequences.                
                

            
                But Democrats dismissed these warnings – demonizing opponents of the law as partisan fear-mongers. The President assured us, “If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.” He said, “No one will take it away, no matter what.”                
                

            
                We now know those promises turned out to be lies. As is his pledge that with a few small tweaks and a new so-called public option, ObamaCare will be on a smooth path forward.                
                

            
                American families are demanding greater affordability and accessibility when it comes to their health care. They are calling for more choice and competition in the health insurance marketplace. And they are urging their leaders to challenge the status quo – not act as rubber stamps for unworkable policies, as my Democratic opponent in the campaign for Arizona Senate promises to do by defending ObamaCare, her “proudest vote.”                
                

            
                Contrary to the president’s misleading claim in Miami last week, Republicans in Congress are already working to reform this broken system and have introduced numerous pieces of legislation to replace ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Just in this current Congress, Senator David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Congressman Tom Price (R-Ga.) and I introduced the Empowering Patients First Act, which would replace ObamaCare with patient-centered policies that would actually lower costs and increase competition for consumers.                
                

            
                We’d do this by establishing age-adjusted tax credits, providing economic incentives to purchase coverage, and allow people to purchase insurance across state lines. All of this and more can be accomplished while ensuring no one is priced-out of the market if they have a pre-existing condition.                
                

            
                If we don’t change direction soon, we are likely to end up where we are headed – to even higher health care costs, less choices and decreased quality of care.                
                

            
                The surest way to alter the dangerous course we are on would be at the ballot box by sending Republican majorities back to Congress who are committed to repealing and replacing this failed law.                
                

            
                We need leaders who will fight for health care reform that works by putting patients first.

                So what would a Romney presidency look like?                
                

            
                As a Romney supporter, I already have a good idea of what to expect from a President Romney. But like many voters who either already support Romney or are considering Romney, I want to hear more specifics over the course of the presidential debates scheduled for this month.                 
                

            
                Watch the second presidential debate LIVE on Fox News Channel and FoxNews.com beginning at 8:55 pm ET.                
                

            
                Specifically, here is what I want to hear from Romney:                
                

            
                1. How will Romney lead by example?                
                

            
                The former Massachusetts governor is known for being frugal in his everyday life. He does his own laundry and irons his own shirts. He should carry those habits into the White House. Specifically, during the debates he should tell Americans that as we prepare to sacrifice for the next generation, he will lead by example. This isn't a way to cut the deficit. Rather, it's to show that by cutting back on the perks of the presidency -- taxpayer funded vacations, unlimited travel options, big inaugural parties -- that a President Romney appreciates that we're all in this together                
                

            
                2. How will Romney end trillion-dollar deficits?                
                

            
                President Obama promised to cut the deficit in half in four years. But far from halving the deficit, Obama has more than doubled it.                 
                

            
                Romney is a budget hawk and a voracious consumer of data.  He has the training and expertise to explain to Americans how he will do what his predecessor could not.                 
                

            
                During the next two debates, he should give concrete examples of what he would do to pull the country back from the fiscal cliff. He can pore over the inspector general reports from the numerous federal agencies that are always documenting waste and abuse. For example, in 2011 an inspector general's report suggested that one minor policy change would save Medicare over a billion dollars annually  on the costs for just one drug. This is the type of concrete examples voters need to hear.                
                

            
                3. How will Romney keep his promises?                
                

            
                As governor of Massachusetts, Romney had his staff document every campaign promise so that voters could hold him to account. A President Romney should offer the same thing, only he should offer to put his campaign promises on the White House web site where they would be open, transparent, and there would be nowhere to hide. Romney should offer this during the debates, while also pointing out how the media has failed to hold Obama to account for his broken promises. Which could lead to the line: ""I'll do the job the media hasn't done in four years.""                
                

            
                4. Other than the deficit and the economy, what are Romney's top priorities and how will he tackle them?                
                

            
                Voters know that whoever is president next year, he will have to do something about the economy and spending. Those issues will be covered during the debates. But what else would top a Romney administration to-do list? For Obama, it was health care reform. This is an opportunity for Romney to really step outside the box and present a bold agenda to voters: is it immigration reform; Social Security/Medicare reform; or a foreign policy initiative?                
                

            
                5. Explain why an administration lasts four years, not eight.                
                

            
                Obama now argues that he needs another four years to complete his agenda and see results. This opens an opportunity for Romney to remind voters that if a president can't get results in four years, then he shouldn't be given another four years. Romney should make a deal with Americans during the debate: He should present a metric (GDP, employment, etc.) and promise that if he does not meet that metric, then he will not run for reelection. Romney wants to be president to fix things. And a president can fix things in four years.                
                

            
                Our nation faces serious challenges that our political leaders have ignored. Romney's biggest challenge as president will be convincing Americans that we all must share in sacrifice for the next generation. He needs to start persuading us on Tuesday night.

Sean Hannity: GOP must come together to save Trump agenda,"Now Playing                            Hannity: Freedom Caucus not to blame for health care failure                                                                                                
				    
			
		 

    






                        






    
        
        
        
            
                After the House Republican leadership's plan to repeal and replace ObamaCare stalled in Congress, the mainstream media decided the Trump presidency is dead in the water.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Since taking office, President Trump has been checking off his campaign promises, one by one. It’s obvious that the president has been moving very fast and effectively, at what I call “the speed of Trump.” And now, there’s a danger that infighting in the Republican Party could undermine the president's agenda.                
                

            
                Trump even noted this potential problem with a Thursday morning tweet aimed at House conservatives who some blame for the health care reform debacle.                
                

            
                ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda,” Trump tweeted. “If they don't get on the team and fast, we must fight them and Dems in 2018.""                
                

            
                The president is clearly frustrated with this division in the Republican Party. It’s understandable.                
                

            
                For seven long years, the GOP ran on repealing and replacing ObamaCare.  ""Give us the House,"" they said. They got it in 2010. ""Give us the Senate,"" they said. They got it in 2014. ""Give us the White House,"" they said. On Nov. 8, they got the last piece of the puzzle.                
                

            
                Republicans should control Washington. And they should have a unified plan to implement their agenda.                
                

            
                In my opinion, it's not the Freedom Caucus that's responsible for the GOP failure to repeal and replace ObamaCare. The legislation put forward by the House leadership was flawed from the beginning. It was created behind closed doors, and no Freedom Caucus members saw it until it was rolled out. That made it a disaster.                
                

            
                I don't know who is telling the White House to focus its anger on the Freedom Caucus, but it's misplaced. The members of the Freedom Caucus have told me personally that they want to make a deal and they want the win for the president and the country.                
                

            
                My advice to Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of Congress is simple: Get all the differing factions in your caucus together. Get them together with senators like Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Mitch McConnell and Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price.                
                

            
                Get everybody in a room, lock the door, order pizza and beer. Don’t come out until you have a consensus bill like the one you've been promising the country for eight years. And when you do, take it straight to the president's desk.                
                

            
                Your mission is to keep your promise. It's not ideology. It's what's good for the American people and it is no more and no less than what you said you would do.

              President Trump caused some head scratching when he told a plane full of journalists en route to France that “what I’d like to do is a comprehensive immigration plan.” But as the Russia investigations drag on, the prospects for health care reform are on hold, and tax reform continues to be a work in progress, this seemingly far-fetched plan may in fact be the most likely opportunity for the president to land a signature legislative victory during his first year in office. 
              
                  
                      
                  
                  
                      
                  
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              It’s not the conventional bet, but this is not a conventional time nor a conventional president – and, this is not the first time we’ve seen him lay some groundwork for such a pursuit. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              The travel ban and aggressive enforcement have been the face of the administration’s immigration policy thus far, but the facts on the ground have changed of late. The president just announced the number of illegal border crossings has dropped by 75 percent since his inauguration.  This may create the opportunity to do more.
              
             
                           		
					
              
              
              
              

    

    

    
    	
	       	
	       	
		        
		            Getting to yes on immigration would be a legacy-making move for President Trump – his Nixon-goes-to-China moment.
					
		        
	        
        
    



              
          
               Even before his comments on Air Force One, President Trump had signaled a desire and willingness to go beyond enforcement to fix the broken visa system and address the fact that 11 million people live here without legal status. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              A couple weeks ago he told Apple CEO Tim Cook and a gathering of tech leaders that he would put “more heart”into the immigration debate and pledged to work on comprehensive immigration reform, a sentiment he had expressed a couple months earlier to a room full of broadcast journalists. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              These comments may be far from setting administration policy – indeed, Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly just indicated he may not defend Obama-era protection for DREAMers and Politico is reporting that some in the Trump Administration are advocating for cutting legal immigration in half – but they do make clear that a broad immigration overhaul is on the president’s mind and he is open to taking on the issue that has stymied every president since Reagan.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
                  
                      
                  
              
          
              I’ll be the first to acknowledge reasonable skepticism, but working on this issue from a nonpartisan vantage point, I believe there are three compelling reasons to believe immigration reform is and should be at the top of the agenda:
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              First, this is how President Trump can fulfill his promises on immigration enforcement. On its own, a bill to build a wall is dead on arrival in the Senate. However, in 2013, a comprehensive bill passed the Senate with votes from 54 Democrats and 14 Republicans. And it passed because instead of focusing solely on enforcement, it overhauled our outdated legal immigration system.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
               The bill didn’t skimp on the border, either. It included $46 billion for security and enforcement, double what President Trump is requesting for his wall now. It mandated hundreds of miles of walls and fences, doubled the number of border patrol agents, and funded aircraft, watchtowers, ground sensors, and mobile surveillance to further monitor the border, while also cracking down on employers who hired undocumented immigrants.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Second, and in contrast to many of the administration’s other legislative priorities, overhauling the immigration system already enjoys major bipartisan support in this Congress. Since the 2013 bill, new Republican supporters like Senator Thom Tillis have joined longtime Republican stalwarts like Senators Flake and Hatch in calling for broad immigration reform. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              In this Congress, Republicans in both chambers have already introduced four distinct bills that would provide undocumented immigrants with legal status. (One such bill in the House has attracted more than 200 co-sponsors, including 99 Republicans.)
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Finally, despite all the political rhetoric, immigration is actually one of the least controversial policy issues out there.  Americans don’t want open borders and amnesty, but they also don’t want to deport 11 million people, the vast majority of whom are not criminals, are working, and are active members of their communities. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Multiple polls show that Americans of all political persuasions, including a clear majority of Trump voters, overwhelmingly support immigration reform that would secure the border, grant legal status to non-criminal undocumented immigrants, and bring the visa system into the 21st century by increasing protections for American workers while also allowing companies to recruit the top talent and necessary workers to fill gaps in the American workforce.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
               Importantly, popular support for these policies is only growing – but to enact them, we’ll need a dealmaker who can succeed where so many others have failed. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              To get a deal, President Trump needs to sweeten the pot by adding broadly popular reforms that would grow the American economy. According to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, such comprehensive reform would cut the deficit by $900 billion over 20 years because of tax revenues from the millions of people who would be able to formally enter the workforce, and would actually result in a 0.5 percent wage increase for all American workers. It would go a long way toward supporting the administration’s economic growth and job creation goals – the president’s own chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has written extensively on the large gains immigration reform can bring – while also creating the budget room for other major priorities. 
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              Of course, the loudest voices might insist on an enforcement-only approach, and decry anything they suspect to be “amnesty.” But balanced against such a challenge will be the enormous political, historical, and economic upside of passing comprehensive immigration reform. Getting to yes on immigration would be a legacy-making move for President Trump – his Nixon-goes-to-China moment, one that would put his deal-making skills on a level with the last president to sign immigration reform, Ronald Reagan.
              
             
               
              
              
              


              
          
              After decades of gridlock on immigration, political necessity and popular demand seem to have aligned. Now it’s in the power of the Dealmaker in Chief to make immigration reform a reality.

No Republican alternatives to ObamaCare?

                The White House and Nancy Pelosi announced with great excitement this week that the President’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is a huge success because they hit their goal of signing up 7 million people to the new federal system.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The celebrating should stop there. Hitting a target without full recognition of the brokenness of the overall health care  scheme is nothing to be proud of.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                The law has provided anything but economic security to Americans who need a buffer against life’s unexpected circumstances. For instance:                
                

            
                 
 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the law’s incentives will slash our economy’s total number of hours worked by the equivalent of around 2.5 million jobs by 2024, and its redefinition of the work week will force schools and small businesses to either cut employees’ hours or lay them off entirely. 
 President Obama said Americans could keep their doctors and insurance plans if they liked them, but it is estimated that more than 5.5 million U.S. residents have received cancellation letters from their insurers, including 185,000 Illinoisans. An economist from the American Enterprise Institute estimates that as many as 43 percent of Americans will face changes to their insurance plans. 
 The persistent claim that the law would “bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family” has proven untrue. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office predicted in 2009 that premiums would increase 10-13 percent in the individual market and $2100 per family in the non-group market. A CMS study has predicted that 65 percent of small businesses may see their health premiums increase. And premiums have continued to rise for middle class Americans. 
                
                

            
                Our leaders in the governor’s mansion have jumped on the bandwagon, ignoring the challenge that the law poses to Illinois. While Gov. Quinn did not hesitate to push Illinoisians onto ObamaCare, enrollment has lagged. Only 13,733 Illinois residents signed up for coverage during the first five months of the enrollment period, more than 100,000 people short of the original goal. So Gov. Quinn decided to partner with the satirical news site, The Onion, to push enrollment. While The Onion is skilled at humor, losing your insurance or doctor is no laughing matter for Illinois families.                
                

            
                The administration’s solution to the law’s disastrous performance is to suspend the rule of law, and authorize a myriad of delays of some of the law’s most unpopular provisions under a “fix-of-the-day” approach to public backlash. And it’s no coincidence that some of these delays push the law’s application until after the November midterm elections.                
                

            
                While Democrats fight to delay the law’s real consequences for health consumers until after they’ve secured re-election, House Republicans have always fought for positive alternatives – not just repeals – that will provide economic security for Americans, while protecting patient choice and driving down health care costs.                
                

            
                H.R. 3121, the American Health Care Reform Act, and H.R. 2300, the Empowering Patients First Act, both repeal the president’s health care  law but spur competition to lower health care costs and provide tax incentives for people to maintain health insurance.                
                

            
                These bills and others like them embody viable alternative models to ObamaCare.                
                

            
                These ideas include allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines, enabling small businesses to pool together and get the same buying power as large corporations, and allowing individuals to pool together to provide coverage through churches, alumni associations, trade associations, and other civic groups.                
                

            
                Smart tax provisions would allow families and individuals to deduct health care costs, just like companies. Expanding, not retracting, access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), would allow individuals to deposit even more of their income tax-free into savings accounts that they can use for health expenses.                
                

            
                Reforming medical malpractice laws would protect caring doctors who just want to practice medicine.                
                

            
                Alternatives like these would also give greater flexibility to Medicare patients, tackle fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and address our doctor shortage by offering loans to medical students.                
                

            
                Thursday, the House will take up a bill I co-sponsored, H .R. 2575, the Save American Workers Act, which will protect hard-working Americans from losing hours and wages as a result of the law’s redefinition of the work week.  American workers fought hard for the 40 hour work week. They shouldn’t have to give it up just because the administration needs the money that would come to the federal government by way of fines to keep the ACA afloat.                
                

            
                But we should also keep what is good about the President’s law by safeguarding individuals with pre-existing conditions through state-based high risk pools and extending HIPAA guaranteed availability protections. No one should be denied coverage based on a disease or ailment outside of their control.                
                

            
                Like any piece of legislation, these ideas aren’t perfect or complete. They need to be debated through the normal legislative process to fine-tune them to the needs of American health consumers. That’s what was missing when the Affordable Care Act was passed four years ago: a thorough debate about what works and what doesn’t.                
                

            
                While the law was passed by one side of the aisle then, that shouldn’t stop us from working together to truly reform our health care system. I hope Democrats will stop doubling down on promises that have proven impossible to keep, and join us in this fight to offer real economic security to struggling Americans.

                Watching New Jersey Governor Chris Christie twisting in the breeze, and reading a beaten down President Obama’s interview in the current New Yorker magazine, I am reminded of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's caution that in politics, as in life, ""standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous; you get knocked down by the traffic from both sides.""                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The governor and the president aspired to break out of their respective stereotypes and attract broad bipartisan support. Both, though, have been hobbled by self-inflicted wounds. Christie crashed into Bridgegate. Obama seems lost in the Matrix known as Obamacare. Both proud, powerful men are humbled by their natural enemies’ ascendant.

                In Governor Christie’s case, despite his conciliatory inaugural speech, which called for an end to divisive partisanship, it seems unlikely that the pro-life, pro-immigration reform, pro-business conservative will ever again attract the Democrats and independents that propelled him to re-election by 22 points last November.                
                

            
                Those fair weather friends are gone forever. Six of the governor’s closest aides are implicated in a series of infuriating, possibly criminal scandals including the infamous bridge closing, and progressive partisan purists are gloating, “See, I told you so; Christie’s just another right-wing bully.”

                Instead, he was muscular in hunting down al-Qaida, and he resisted attempts to stereotype his domestic agenda; ""General Motors is alive. Bin Laden is dead,"" and all that.                
                

            
                But his goal of being a leader for all the people collapsed, in part crushed by the worst website ever launched. After jamming through his national healthcare scheme without a single Republican vote, and then lying about its consequences, he’s lost the chance to be a transformative president.                
                

            
                He wanted to be regarded as a Teddy Roosevelt or Abe Lincoln; now he’s fighting to avoid going down in history as a black Franklin Pearce or Millard Fillmore.                
                

            
                Mr. Obama's worst sin in health care reform was trying to chart a middle-course between doing nothing about the uninsured, which the right preferred, and giving everybody Medicare, which he should have done if he cared about satisfying his natural allies on the left.                
                

            
                Hosting a call-in radio show as I do isn’t like running a state or a country, but it is an excellent place to understand the difficulty of moderation, and to feel the depth of emotion on the left and right. Each extreme is hyper-vigilant to bust my chops whenever they sense I’ve strayed too red or too blue.                
                

            
                Still, because compromise and conciliation are the only way to preserve ""a more perfect union,"" here is a partial program for the next generation Obama or Christie.                
                

            
                Among many other policies, the thoroughly modern moderate must,                
                

            
                1.- Embrace the domestic policies of centrist Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who warned of the consequences of the deterioration of the traditional family. To combat the malignant trend of unwed, single mothers, implement Geraldo's Law, which mandates that there be a father's name on every birth certificate. In the case of same sex marriage, which I also embrace, the law would require two parents to be named, regardless of sex.                
                

            
                2.- In fact, emphasize personal responsibility in all policies. Example: unemployment insurance must be capped at 26 weeks. Any longer than six months encourages sloth and destroys ambition. At times of national or regional economic duress, when unemployment persists above say 6 percent, extended unemployment insurance would be provided. But it would require the recipient to work for the government in some capacity that requires him or her to show up somewhere, everyday. No show, no pay.                
                

            
                3.- Proclaim that the federal minimum wage of $7.25 is obscenely low and must be raised. California's proposal to go up to $8/hour in 2014 and $10/hour in 2016 is about right. Once set, federal minimum wage must be tied to inflation.                     
                

            
                4.- Be in favor of charter schools and universal pre-K. Be against public sector strikes and ridiculously lush pensions. Everyone would be required to contribute to their own retirement accounts.                
                

            
                5.- Abolish the cap on payroll tax, which is rising this year to $117,900. Someone making $117,900 should not be paying the same total dollar amount of payroll tax that someone making $117,900,000 pays. This reform would fund Social Security indefinitely and is a Rich Man's tax that does not punish success. Also, the retirement age must be gradually increased as life expectancy continues to rise.                
                

            
                6.- Be in favor of Stop and Frisk, and other pro-active New York City-style policing. But legalize marijuana and dramatically reduce penalties for most drug use. Abolish mandatory minimum sentencing.                   
                

            
                7.- Be for vastly broadened legal immigration. It is what makes us stronger than shrinking nations like Russia and Japan. Be in favor of a broad amnesty for otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before a certain date.                
                

            
                8.- Be against the stridency of organized protest groups including the NAACP, the Tea Parties, and the militant wings of both the Gay Rights and Pro-Life movements.                
                

            
                9.- Be against the blasphemous exploitation of tragedies like Benghazi, either by Democrats looking to protect Hillary Clinton or Republicans who keep repeating the lie that we could have saved our people there, if only Barack Obama had stayed in the Situation Room that awful night.                
                

            
                10.- Be extremely reluctant to commit to large-scale foreign interventions like Afghanistan and Iraq.                
                

            
                11.- Be in favor of state-of-the-art, but reasonable, prudent intelligence gathering with judicial supervision.                
                

            
                12.- Be in favor of tax and business policies that reward enterprise and preserve capital, not crony capitalists, who are the ultimate socialists. Proclaim a partial tax amnesty for repatriated capital currently being held abroad. Keep inheritance and capital gains taxes reduced.                
                

            
                13.- Remove defense spending from legislative control. Close unnecessary military bases, like those in Germany and those in the U.S. that were built to fight Native Americans and Mexico in the 19th century. Phase out weapons programs that a panel of real war fighters deems wasteful and ineffective. Tax lobbyists. Restrict the number of lawyers graduating each year. Vastly expand medical school enrollment. Offer free medical school tuition to all doctors and other health care professionals who would then be required to work in the community for a designated period after graduation.                
                

            
                There is much more, but be warned, because this manifesto has something to anger everyone, if you embrace it you had better not stumble or, as Christie and Obama have discovered, the partisans will seek to destroy you.

                While Republicans running for president immerse themselves in primary and caucus battles (and plan for a possible contested convention), it’s worth considering well in advance how they should do battle with the eventual Democratic nominee.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Politics resembles business, sports, betting and board games in that winning requires not just making the right moves in real time but also anticipating the right moves for the times ahead.                 
                

            
                In politics, victory requires you to define your adversary’s vulnerabilities long before their negative definitions of you solidify into concrete that traps you, as Barack Obama’s demonization of Mitt Romney trapped Romney in 2012, months before Romney’s nomination.                 
                

            
                Republicans must intensify their case against Hillary Clinton now, before both parties’ national conventions in July. They can’t be outmaneuvered by Clinton’s pouring of concrete on them!                
                

            
                The vulnerabilities of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton and determined underdog Bernie Sanders are apparent from public opinion polls. But Clinton is the higher priority focus.                
                

            
                In a fairly recent Gallup poll, voters described Clinton, as a “liar” (voters say she is “dishonest,” they “don’t trust her” and she has “poor character”). Voters identify Sanders as a “socialist.”                
                

            
                But let’s get real. The liar will defeat the socialist (Clinton triumphs by telling lies and selling lies). Even if the FBI uncovers strong evidence that Clinton committed criminal offenses with her personal email system, how likely is it that Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the Justice Department—controlled by Obama—will pursue those criminal charges?                
                

            
                So, let’s go with the conventional wisdom that Clinton’s nearly insurmountable delegate lead will make her the Democratic nominee (despite recent impressive primary wins by Sanders). And let’s examine where Republicans should call out Clinton for the harm she would do to the “everyday Americans” she claims to “champion.”                 
                

            
                The evidence is in Clinton’s own misleading statements. According to the website On the Issues, described as “non-partisan and non-profit,” here are some citations, drawn from “newspapers, speeches, press releases, book excerpts, House and Senate voting records, Congressional bill sponsorships, political affiliations and ratings, and campaign websites from the Internet.”                
                

            
                Here are just some examples:                
                

            
                • Clinton has insisted that, “I am a progressive who gets things done.” Really? When asked by ABC’s Diane Sawyer what her “marquee achievement” was, Clinton “changed the subject and she fumbled over a similar question during a women’s forum in Manhattan last year. ‘I see my role as secretary [of state]—in fact leadership in general in a democracy—as a relay race. You run the best race you can run, you hand off the baton. Some of what hasn’t been finished may go on to be finished,’ she told [New York Times columnist] Thomas Friedman.”                 
                

            
                Huh? Clinton’s clumsy attempts to distract from her lack of accomplishments provide Republican presidential candidates with target-rich opportunities to set the record straight.                
                

            
                As The Washington Post has reported, even many Clinton supporters have struggled to come up with any significant Clinton achievements.                 
                

            
                Clinton herself provides little help as she twists herself in knots attempting to defend her defense of ObamaCare. She’s reduced to taking credit as the progenitor of the president’s unpopular health care reform.                 
                

            
                She told Iowans in a campaign rally in January, “It was called HillaryCare before it was called ObamaCare.” But as The Hill (online) points out, “Clinton has had to tread carefully on ObamaCare throughout her campaign: Democrats support the law but are increasingly willing to acknowledge that it doesn't address the rising out-of-pocket costs.” And Republicans looking for a detailed prescription for how to repeal and replace ObamaCare are advised to consult a new book by my friend (and Fox News contributor) Steve Forbes, “Reviving America: How Repealing Obamacare, Replacing the Tax Code, and Reforming the Fed will Restore Hope and Prosperity.”                
                

            
                • Clinton has said, “What's true in our daily lives is also true at the highest levels of government. Keeping America safe, strong, and prosperous presents an endless set of choices.” But the damaging choices Clinton has made include her support of President Obama’s increasingly dangerous, disingenuous and deceptive Iran nuclear deal. Her other catastrophic choices as secretary of state range from her lies and failures of judgment about Benghazi and Libya at large to her massive mismanagement of U.S. policies regarding Syria, Russia, ISIS and other slaughterers of innocents, documented in The Huffington Post.                
                

            
                • Clinton called criticism of her by Republicans as “all a political ploy.” Well, it’s not a ploy for Republican presidential candidates to brand Clinton with her own words. As author and Donald Trump supporter Wayne Allyn Root suggested, “Do you remember [Clinton’s] Congressional hearings over the Benghazi disaster? Hillary famously said, ‘What difference does it make?’ when referring to four dead American heroes. Make her own that brand. ‘What difference does it make’ should become Hillary’s middle name. Make her run on Benghazi, Obamacare and Obama’s economy, and Hillary will soon find out what difference it all makes.”                
                

            
                The Republican plan to defeat Hillary Clinton is as simple as ABC: Always Brand Clinton—by quoting her own dishonesty and disinformation.

Progressives must hold Obama accountable for NSA phone spying,"FILE- In this Dec. 8, 2005, file photo, a man walks out the Verizon's new corporate headquarters(AP Photo/Dima Gavrysh, File)

                Friday, the New York Times published an editorial about the recent revelation that our federal government is collecting broad data on the phone calls made by Americans, writing that the Obama administration “has now lost all credibility on this issue.”                                             ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                This is significant not because liberal voices and institutions have failed to criticize the president before.                 
                

            
                To the contrary, the New York Times editorial board and others have been quite vocal on condemning the drone program, aggressive investigations of journalists in leak probes, record deportations of immigrant families and more.

                But largely because of our hyper-partisan climate and the unrelenting, politically-motivated attacks against President Obama from the right, many liberals and progressives have been reluctant to throw down strong gauntlets before the administration. But the times, and the Times, are changing.

                The problem with hyper-partisanship is that those on both sides constantly defend their own camp and attack the other with little regard for history, logic or ideology.                 
                

            
                Republicans condemn the individual mandate in health care reform while Democrats rationalize drone warfare.                 
                

            
                Conservatives who ran up the deficit under Republican presidents call deficit spending reckless when led by Democrats. And progressives who in previous decades were leading skeptics about the “big brother” power of government cow in complacency to defend the creeping and creepy expansion of government intrusion in our lives.                
                

            
                Conservatives, progressives, Democrats, Republicans — we’ve all fallen into the trap of turning a blind eye to our own side’s abuses while fairly blindly hurling accusations at the other. This stops now.                
                

            
                Wednesday night, hours after it was revealed that the National Security Agency has been collecting phone records of a large swath of the American public for apparently at least seven years, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee launched a petition to immediately investigate and release all its findings to the public.                
                

            
                I whole-heartedly back that call. Those of us who opposed the strategy and scope of the Patriot Act when it originated under President Bush must just as firmly denounce it use and abuse under President Obama.                
                

            
                Not all Democrats have remained silent. I, and many others, have already called recent developments, particularly the secret subpoenaing of broad records from AP and Fox News reporters, deeply disturbing. And the fantastic reporter Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian, who broke the story about our government collecting Verizon phone records and Internet data, is a progressive.                
                

            
                Nor should we ignore that, in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder last year, Democratic Senators Mark Udall (Colorado) and Ron Wyden (Oregon) wrote, “We believe most Americans would be stunned to learn the details of.?.?.these secret court opinions. As we see it, there is now a significant gap between what most Americans think the law allows and what the government secretly claims the law allows.” Udall told the Denver Post Thursday that it did everything short of leaking classified information” to bring attention to what the NSA was doing.                
                

            
                But the willingness to critique President Obama has often been understandably tempered by a fear of playing into the Republican desire to blow up concerns into controversies and bring down the Obama administration by any means necessary.                
                

            
                Flagrant overreach laced with conspiracy theories, from Fast and Furious to Benghazi, reveal that Republicans are no longer invested in leading the role of legitimate oversight but the circus act of political destruction.                
                

            
                Those who generally support President Obama’s ideas and objectives are understandably wary to simultaneously criticize the president when he falls short on our ideals, lest our critiques be used as extra bricks in the partisan campaign to sink his ship.                
                

            
                All of these concerns are legitimate. I, and no one on the left, wants our substantive critiques of the Obama administration to inadvertently play into the viciously anti-Obama agenda of the right which is fueled by a deep hatred for the president that has deeper and darker origins than policy differences alone.                
                

            
                Yet still, there are moments where we are called on to be citizens first, and partisans second.                
                

            
                Progressives don’t want to bring down the president, but we do want to hold him accountable. And it is the job of we, the people, to hold our government accountable.                
                

            
                The recent revelations about the scale and scope of government surveillance on the American people should concern all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike.                
                

            
                The fact that the collection of vast phone records that apparently began under President Bush and was continued by President Obama may be a sufficiently bipartisan offense to coalesce a bipartisan opposition. Let’s hope that Americans of all political stripes can join together to demand transparency and accountability from our government and ensure that the desire to protect our safety is never a justification for attacking our liberties.

                Last week at a conference on the new health care law I got a big surprise.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                While Washington politicians are in a never-ending fight over President Obama’s health care reform many of the nation’s top insurance companies, brokers and major employers have long ago moved beyond the bitter debate in Washington. Even more than other Americans, they can’t understand a government shut down over the plan.                
                

            
                Unlike Americans who tell pollsters they don’t like the new law and find it confusing, the business professionals dealing with the day-to-day reality of the new health insurance landscape accept the Affordable Care Act as straight forward approach to begin cutting the rising cost of health care for people and companies.                
                

            
                [pullquote]                
                

            
                At the conference, sponsored by the Sun Life Financial Inc., these health care and corporate professionals pointed to reductions in the expense health care puts on small businesses with less than 50 workers. And they think people who work for small companies – as well as part time workers-- will get a better deal from public marketplaces for insurance than from most existing employer plans for part-timers.

                The business leaders are thinking about how the new law allows employees at big companies more freedom to decide what they want covered by the money provided to employees for health care.                 
                

            
                They are looking forward to employers being freed to focus on employee retention and motivation beyond health care plans.                
                

            
                And despite all the energy Republicans have dedicated to fight health care reform one of the nation’s leading health care economists Jonathan Gruber, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said about 80 percent of Americans are going to feel no change at all from ObamaCare.                
                

            
                Gruber helped to design the health care reform in Massachusetts under Republican Mitt Romney and advised the Obama administration on its plan.                 
                

            
                He estimates 17 percent of Americans will be demonstrably “better off” with lower cost insurance and better benefits while about three percent will face higher premiums and be “worse off.”                
                

            
                The recent demands from Republicans in Washington for a one-year delay in starting the government plan also struck the health care experts as damaging to companies and individuals. They see it as a cynical, political effort to sabotage the Affordable Care Act under the guise of “fairness.”                
                

            
                Professor Gruber, the keynote speaker at the forum, has previously estimated that the one-year delay of the individual mandate for all Americans to buy insurance would result in 24 million more Americans being uninsured.                 
                

            
                He calculated that the average health insurance premiums for Americans would rise 27 percent because of a delay.                  
                

            
                Gruber’s numbers have support from an updated study by the Center for Budget Policy and Priorities. It similarly concluded that a one year delay would result in millions more Americans being uninsured and higher health insurance premiums.                
                

            
                “The delay would adversely affect millions of Americans,” the Center reported. “The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that such a delay would cause 11 million more Americans to remain uninsured in 2014 and result in higher premiums for many others. It also would disrupt the new health insurance exchanges just as the open enrollment season is about to begin.”                
                

            
                “Specifically, a one-year delay of the individual mandate would reduce the expected coverage gains under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by nearly 85 percent, relative to current law, according to a recent CBO estimate. Delaying the individual mandate also would raise premiums for health insurance purchased in the individual market in 2014, CBO finds.”                
                

            
                What the experts are saying is that the proposed delay is really an effort to guarantee that the law will not work.                 
                

            
                At the end of the one year it would allow critics to say “see, we told you so.” This would be like an arsonist complaining that a building was too flammable and personally setting it on fire to prove his point.                
                

            
                New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said that each of us is entitled to our own opinions but not to our own facts.                
                

            
                If Republicans and conservative commentators are going to condemn the individual mandate they are going to have to deal with the business leaders who pay for health insurance, the brokers who sell the insurance and the experts who study it.                
                

            
                And their facts add to the high disapproval rates House Republicans are getting in polls for shutting down the government over the new health care law. And guess what? Those poll numbers are even worse than ObamaCare’s numbers.

Obama Pushes Health Care Reform…Again!,"President Obama is in full campaign mode, now promising to Fix Our Budget Deficits!                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                Unfortunately, Mr. Obama as cost-cutter is about as believable as Buffy as Vampire-slayer; meanwhile, the need to rally his liberal base is paramount. Consequently, he has offered up juicy sound bites about hitting up “millionaires and billionaires” and a promise -- not to raise taxes, which might not play well on prime time -- but rather to cut “tax expenditures.”                 
                

            
                In other words, we are now being treated to more Obama gobbledegook, from the same press office that came up with “kinetic military action” and “man-caused disasters”. And – this is a president that ran on transparency!                
                

            
                The president’s budget speech should, however, be welcomed by Republicans. President Obama unwittingly gave the GOP a rallying cry for the 2012 campaign. In (finally) putting forth his proposal to narrow our country’s long-term budget deficits, Mr. Obama all but acknowledged that Medicare and Medicaid – which Obama has called the “single biggest contributors to our long-term deficit” -- remain open sores, oozing red ink into the foreseeable future.                
                

            
                Stop a minute for this to sink in. After all the disruptive skirmishing and chicanery that finally paved the way for Obamacare, we now find that we are again going to the mattresses --- over healthcare costs. Does no one else find this a complete and perfect indictment of the cynically titled Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that Mr. Obama sold the nation? In effect, the president makes clear that his gigantic healthcare bill, that divided the country when it needed healing, did not fix the problem. Republicans should fasten onto this virtual admission like limpets.                
                

            
                Remember the promises? “We agree on reforms that will finally reduce the costs of health care….This plan will strengthen Medicare and extend the life of that program. And because it gets rid of the waste and inefficiencies in our health care system, this will be the largest deficit reduction plan in over a decade.” Moreover, Mr. Obama touted the cost-saving nature of the bill: “whatever ideas exist in terms of bending the cost curve and starting to reduce costs…those elements are in this bill.” Most important, the president emphasized that the bill “has to be budget neutral, it’s got to be deficit neutral…”                
                

            
                It turns out that ObamaCare did not bend the cost curve, was not budget neutral and in fact added to the country’s swollen government healthcare budget. Is anyone surprised?                
                

            
                What is surprising is that President Obama is now ramping up to make the debate over healthcare a cornerstone of his reelection campaign. This is unexpected because so far ObamaCare has not won the president many friends, except from his liberal base. Democrats continue to say the fault is in the messaging – that it was not “sold” properly. Rubbish!                
                

            
                President Obama, who early in his tenure was extremely popular, spent months and months criss-crossing the country, giving dozens of speeches that extolled its virtues. Nonetheless, Americans remain neutral at best on ObamaCare. They would surely be even more negative except that the large taxes incorporated into the bill have not begun to kick in—those were cleverly designed to become effective only after Mr. Obama ran for re-election.                
                

            
                Republicans need to broadcast what the debate over Obama’s health care bill cost the nation. At a time when confidence was shattered by the financial crisis, when businesses were terrified by plummeting demand and needed reassurance, we had instead a president focused on his legacy.                
                

            
                Over the protests of business managers big and small, the president insisted on changing the cost of hiring workers, and flipping upside down existing insurance programs offered to employees. Even as millions of Americans lost their jobs, the president was consumed with the historic nature of his quest.                
                

            
                Economist and former senator Phil Gramm makes the real cost of ObamaCare clear. He compares our current recovery to those that followed the other ten recessions that have occurred since World War II. He says that if this bounce-back had kept pace with those of other cycles, GDP would be significantly higher than it is today, and nearly 12 million more Americans would have jobs. As he acknowledges, Obama supporters will argue that this case was unusual because of the depth of the downturn. Mr. Gramm points out that historically “the bigger the bust, the bigger the boom” that follows. The numbers don’t lie. In past recessions, three years after the downturn, real GDP had increased 7.6% beyond the pre-recession level. Today, GDP is only 0.1% higher.                
                

            
                That, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the real cost of Obamacare. Of course, it is not just the health bill that so unsettled the country, and most importantly the country’s employers. Attempts to change labor rules facilitating union organizing, ramped up antitrust and labor prosecutions, extensive new environmental regulations, the monstrously complex financial bill – they all played a role in setting back our recovery. But Obamacare got the ball rolling.                
                

            
                As we head into the 2012 campaign, Republicans should ask voters, why should you give President Obama another shot at fixing the double disasters of Medicare and Medicaid? Hasn’t he damaged our country enough?

President Obama and the State of Our Future,"Those who are ideologically predisposed to criticize President Obama contort themselves to overlook inconvenient facts.                                            ADVERTISEMENT                                    
                

            
                The fact is that, under President Obama’s leadership, we have seen 22 straight months of private sector job growth.                 
                

            
                While Republicans are accusing the President of being a job killer, the fact is that President Obama has created 3.2 million new private sector jobs. More private sector jobs were created in 2011 in America than any year since 2005.

Oddly, Mitt Romney wants to claim credit for a hundred thousand jobs that were created after his Bain investment (and not count the many more jobs he killed but Republicans refuse to be honest about President Obama’s record of creating jobs and, slowly but surely, bringing our economy back from the brink.

Facts don’t lie, folks.

And so, in tonight’s State of the Union Address, our president will accurately lay out the steps he has taken to help our economy recover and the additional steps he plans to take going forward.                 
                

            
                This is what presidents, Republicans and Democrats, have done at such addresses for generations.                 
                

            
                But Republicans, realizing that stubborn and dishonest attacks on Obama’s policy ideas are backfiring on their own party, will make a desperate attempt to portray the president as “campaigning” during the State of the Union. Somehow, what was defensible under George W. Bush is borderline treasonous under Barack Obama.

The fact is that half of voters -- and, importantly, more than half of self-identified independents -- believe that Republicans in Congress are intentionally sabotaging our economy to hurt President Obama’s re-election prospects.

Another poll asked voters which statement they agree with more: “President Obama is making a good faith effort to deal with the country’s economic problems, but the Republicans in Congress are playing politics by blocking his proposals and programs.” Or this: “President Obama has not provided leadership on the economy, and he is just blaming the Republicans in Congress as an excuse for not doing his job.”                 
                

            
                Not only do the majority of voters agree with the first statement over the second, but the difference is more pronounced among moderate and independent voters. Independents favor the first statement by a 54 to 40 margin. Moderates favor the first statement by a 57 to 37 margin. 

In other words, if the majority of Americans believe that President Obama is trying to lead our economy and our nation forward but Republicans are putting politics ahead of patriotism and actively sabotaging our economy, the president is absolutely right to deliver a strong, bold and sharp-elbowed State of the Union Address that calls out Congressional Republicans for blocking every bipartisan idea that crosses their desks and stubbornly refusing to compromise for the good of the nation.                 
                

            
                Frankly, if the president did not deliver such a firm rebuke tonight, that would be a clear failure of leadership.

Republicans will continue to throw every imaginable criticism plus the kitchen sink at our president. Republicans will call Obama “the food stamp president” -- a racially-tinged charge that ignores the fact that food stamp enrollment was twice as high under President George W. Bush.                 
                

            
                Republicans will accuse Obama’s health care reform law of destroying the economy -- even though jobs are rebounding and most of the law won’t take effect until 2014.                 
                

            
                Republicans will say regulation under Obama is stifling the private sector -- even though, in a key report, small business owners across the United States said it was a lack of consumer demand and not regulations that are hurting their business.                 
                

            
                Republicans will keep attacking Obama for raising taxes -- even though not only has he lowered taxes for 99% of Americans but it’s been Republicans who have blocked vital tax breaks for the middle class.

These baseless smears may fire up a small fringe of the anti-Obama Republican base, but the fact of the matter is most Americans care about results and character. V                
                

            
                oters can tell the difference between a president who is making progress turning the economy around and being honest about the obstacles he’s facing versus desperate presidential contenders who want to sling nothing but mud to distract from their decades of failed leadership that put our country in this crisis.

Of course, as we recover from an historic recession with millions of Americans still unemployed or struggling to get by, no one can say that the state of our union is as strong as it should be or needs to be. But it is getting stronger.                 
                

            
                The plan the president will outline tonight will make our nation stronger, instead of turning us back to the dark ages of Republican class warfare and an economy that only works for the 1%, building an American economy for the future on the foundation of American manufacturing and energy innovation, training American workers for good jobs and reinvesting in the values of fair opportunity that built our great nation.                 
                

            
                I'm not saying the president is perfect nor that I or anyone will agree with everything he says tonight, as in the past. But fundamentally, these are good ideas that, frankly, conservatives in Congress would readily support if they came from a Republican president.                
                

            
                For once, it would be nice for Republicans to honestly listen to what President Obama has to say, using their patriotic hearts not their political brains -- offering feedback based on facts and principles, not personal smears and partisanship.                 
                

            
                But either way, make no mistake about it, the majority of American people have been listening carefully to the President all along -- and liking what they hear.
